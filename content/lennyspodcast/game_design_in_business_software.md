Rahul Vora, founder and CEO of Superhuman, advocates for incorporating game design principles into business software, believing it can make products enjoyable, shareable, and lead to deeper user engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This approach aims to foster word-of-mouth growth and build a strong brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.

## Distinguishing Game Design from Gamification

Vora emphasizes that true game design is distinct from mere gamification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Gamification, which involves adding superficial elements like points, levels, trophies, or badges to a product, often fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. This is because it can undermine intrinsic motivation, which is crucial for genuine engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>.

### The Science of Motivation

To explain why gamification often falls short, Vora references a 1970s Stanford study involving children and drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>. The study differentiated between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>:
*   **Intrinsic motivation** drives individuals to do things because they are inherently interesting and satisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.
*   **Extrinsic motivation** compels individuals to act to earn rewards or achieve external goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

The Stanford study found that children who expected a reward for drawing spent significantly less time drawing spontaneously later, compared to those who received no reward or an unexpected one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. This demonstrates that the presence of an external reward can halve intrinsic motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. Gamification, by relying on external rewards, often faces this same pitfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. When gamification does seem to work, it's often because the underlying experience was *already* designed like a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

## Principles of Game Design at Superhuman

Drawing from his background as a professional game designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>, Vora states that there isn't a single unifying theory for game design. Instead, it draws upon psychology, mathematics, storytelling, and [[importance_of_design_in_product_development | interaction design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. At Superhuman, five key areas are prioritized for game design:
1.  Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>
2.  Emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>
3.  Toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>
4.  Controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>
5.  Flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>

### The "Toys" Principle

One core principle applied at Superhuman is to "make fun toys and then combine those into games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. The best games are built from enjoyable "toys" because they offer fun on both levels: the individual toy and the complete game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.

An example of a "toy" in Superhuman is the time autocompleter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>, used for snoozing or setting reminders on emails. It allows users to type natural language (e.g., "2D" for 2 days, "3 H" for 3 hours, "1 MO" for 1 month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>. This feature is considered fun because:
*   It encourages playful exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. Users often test its limits by trying various inputs like "10 10" (October 10th at 10:10 p.m.) or "in a Fortnite and a day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.
*   It offers pleasant surprises, such as automatic time zone conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a> and the ability to snooze emails "until never" with a shrug emoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

Vora advises product developers to consider if their features:
*   Indulge playful exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>.
*   Are fun even without a specific goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.
*   Elicit moments of pleasant surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.

If these criteria are met, a feature can be considered a "toy" and can then be combined with others to build a more comprehensive and engaging "game" within the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.

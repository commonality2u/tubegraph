Shas Doshi, in a live recording at the Lean Front Summit in San Francisco, shared three questions (plus a bonus) he wished he had asked himself earlier in his career as a product leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His first visit to the podcast was the third most popular episode of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Doshi reflected on his career, noting that he had a "PM life full of suffering" but zero complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. He realized he hadn't been honest with himself about the answers to certain questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Why Am I So Busy? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>

Doshi spent most of his 20-year product career feeling completely stressed and dissatisfied due to being constantly busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This constant stress even manifested as physical pains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. While many product leaders are familiar with productivity tips like to-do lists, the LNO framework, and calendar management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, Doshi argues that at a certain point, a product leader's scope grows so large it will overwhelm them, making efficiency tricks insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

He highlights annual planning as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Managers often spend four to six weeks on spreadsheets, meetings, and stakeholder alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This process makes them busy and can lead to guilt about neglecting their team or product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Doshi realized at Stripe that these extensive planning rituals are not necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Having a "real product strategy" for Stripe Connect, a major product, allowed him to complete planning in just three days, while peers were stuck in weeks-long cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This strategy required pre-alignment and made much of the annual planning "nonsense" disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### The Impact of Poor Decisions

Doshi also realized that he was busy because he wasn't making good product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. He observed product teams making quick decisions based on concepts like "two-way doors" (reversible decisions, popularized by Jeff Bezos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, often without clearly thinking through customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. This often leads to committing to features that take weeks to build and launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. When these features don't gain adoption, PMs use "favorable anecdotes" in QBRs, and sales counterparts push for more "bells and whistles" to meet "table stakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This results in signing up for even more work for features that should not have been built in the first place, accumulating "debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

> "Most doors that look like two-way doors are actually one-way doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

**Tactical Tip:** If you have a clear strategy, many prioritization and planning problems will go away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Sometimes, it is useful to pause for minutes, days, or even weeks before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Thinking is cheap, so do more of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

## Do I Actually Have Good Taste? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>

Early in his career at Google, Doshi was told that "strategy is for MBAs" and that execution was everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. He adopted this mantra, even dismissing colleagues who asked about his product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

His perspective shifted at Twitter after its IPO around 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Despite incredible assets like its product, network effects, brand, and talent, Twitter was struggling to meet its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. After six to nine months, Doshi realized Twitter's biggest problem was a "product strategy problem" â€“ it lacked a real, compelling, cohesive strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. This experience, further solidified at Stripe, taught him the critical importance of a clear strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

He redefines "taste" beyond beautiful pixels or perfect product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. For Doshi, taste is about the beliefs product leaders choose to create within themselves, which then dictate their management, leadership, and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. He realized he lacked "good taste" in evaluating things, how he learned, and from whom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

> "Taste is about the ability to identify what is really good without needing to see its results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

It requires "zero taste" to praise a successful CEO or athlete after their success is evident (e.g., Jensen Huang in 2024, Patrick Mahomes today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. True taste means recognizing greatness *before* the results are clear, like "game recognizing game in the practice session" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

Doshi cautions against becoming "stuff graders" who dismiss everything as "crap," as this also requires "zero taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. He observes that people are often overly impressed by:
*   **Cool metaphors:** "Two-way door" caught on more than "reversible/irreversible decisions" because it was catchier, coupled with authority bias (Bezos said it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   **Alliterations:** "Fail fast" is more attractive than "fail quickly," despite having the same meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.
*   **Complicated charts and math they don't understand:** Some product leaders even use this as a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

The outcome of this self-reflection was shedding these patterns of social proof and authority proof to become a more critical thinker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

## Why Does My Job Feel So Frustrating? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>

Doshi loved his PM leadership job but experienced daily frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. He noted that the PM leader's job is extremely lonely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. He learned that jobs become frustrating when one behaves mostly "in misalignment with our superpowers and who we truly are at our core" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

He introduced a simple framework for product work at three levels:
1.  **Impact Level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>
2.  **Execution Level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>
3.  **Optics Level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>

Doshi's epiphany was realizing he had a preferred level of operation (Impact) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. As he went higher up the corporate ladder, he was forced to spend more time on "Optics," which, despite having the willpower and skills for, caused him frustration because willpower is finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

The solution was to [[exploring_alternative_career_paths | abandon the traditional career path]] or the "corporate game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. When his team at Stripe grew to about 50 people (engineers and all), he decided that was enough, as larger teams inevitably require a lot of time at the Optics level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. Instead of pushing through, he intentionally moved back to more of an earlier-stage product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.

His suggestion for [[building_a_meaningful_career | building a meaningful career]] and [[the_importance_of_longterm_career_planning | career planning]] is to [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | identify your superpowers]] and be true to yourself, operating your career based on that, not on external expectations or "LinkedIn envy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. Working in accordance with your superpowers leads to doing your best work, loving it, and being great at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

## Am I Really Listening? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>

This was the hardest question for Doshi to confront because he thought he was a good listener (recapping, eye contact) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. However, he realized there is an "entirely other level to listening" that enables one to be a world-class leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. For resources on this deeper level of listening, he recommends exploring the insights of Rick Rubin, Dee Hock, and Peter Drucker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

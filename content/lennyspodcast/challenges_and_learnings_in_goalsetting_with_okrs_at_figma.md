Yuki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, describes a "love-hate relationship" with [[Benefits and challenges of implementing OKRs | OKRs]] due to their inherent challenges, especially when applied to core product experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. Figma's journey with [[Benefits and challenges of implementing OKRs | OKRs]] has involved continuous experimentation and learning, reflecting a broader "work in progress" philosophy within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.

## Initial Challenges with OKRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>

For product managers working on core product experiences, [[Benefits and challenges of implementing OKRs | OKRs]] can be particularly frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. The main difficulties encountered include:

*   **Performative Metrics**: It's challenging to define [[Strategies for Setting Effective Goals | metrics]] for improving core experiences without them feeling forced or "performative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.
*   **Two Extreme Outcomes**:
    *   **Secondary Metrics**: Teams might resort to measuring secondary [[Strategies for Setting Effective Goals | metrics]] that are measurable but lack proven correlation to actual business value, such as satisfaction scores from a survey without linking it to retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
    *   **Uncontrollable Business Goals**: Alternatively, teams might set ambitious business [[Strategies for Setting Effective Goals | goals]] (e.g., "contribute incremental trips" for a rider experience PM at Uber), which are influenced by many factors beyond the team's control, making it impossible to prove direct impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **OKRs as To-Do Lists**: Upon Yuki's arrival at Figma, [[Benefits and challenges of implementing OKRs | OKRs]] were often treated as a "to-do list" or "task list" rather than strategic objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.
*   **Lack of Clarity and Engagement**: Meetings dedicated to reviewing [[Benefits and challenges of implementing OKRs | OKRs]] were "dreadful" because it was hard to understand what teams truly cared about or whether they were genuinely committed to moving those [[Benefits and challenges of implementing OKRs | OKRs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. Engineers often couldn't articulate their team's main [[Benefits and challenges of implementing OKRs | OKRs]] when asked in the hallway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

## Experimentation and Learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>

Figma has iterated on its [[Benefits and challenges of implementing OKRs | OKR]] approach:

*   **Deprecating Formal Metrics**: Initially, Yuki deprecated formal [[Benefits and challenges of implementing OKRs | OKR]] metrics, encouraging teams to focus on their "headline" or philosophical objective without the stress of immediate measurability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. The goal was to first establish clarity on what teams were optimizing for, then discuss how to measure it, whether qualitatively or quantitatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. A "report card" approach was suggested, where teams self-score and explain their rationale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.
*   **Reintroducing Rigor**: With the hiring of a head of data, [[Benefits and challenges of implementing OKRs | OKRs]] were brought back with more rigor, leveraging a data science team for better [[Strategies for Setting Effective Goals | metrics]] and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
*   **"Commitments" Experiment**: Figma experimented with calling them "commitments" instead of [[Benefits and challenges of implementing OKRs | OKRs]] to inspire greater accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. This concept aimed to formalize the connection between the "why" (the problem) and the "what" (the project) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.

> "If you ask an engineer about how much time it'll cost to go and build something and it's something that they came up with or they're advocating for it's almost always half the time as something that like you are asking for sapn right and that kind of like motivation is so different..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>

This highlights the importance of intrinsic motivation and personal accountability in driving progress, even if it deviates from a rigid top-down plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

## Yuki Yamashita's Three Philosophies for Good Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>

Regardless of what they are called, Yuki emphasizes three core qualities for effective goals:

1.  **Legendary**: The goal should be clear and easily understood by everyone, avoiding "weird obfuscated [[Strategies for Setting Effective Goals | metrics]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
2.  **Actionability**: The goal should inspire action and encourage people to "do something differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.
3.  **Authenticity**: The goal must genuinely reflect what the team is doing or striving for on a day-to-day basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. If it doesn't, its value is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.

These [[Strategies for Setting Effective Goals | philosophies]] underscore Figma's ongoing effort to refine its goal-setting process, acknowledging that "we haven't quite cracked the code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. The company views its internal processes, including [[Benefits and challenges of implementing OKRs | OKRs]], as a "work in progress" open to continuous learning and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.

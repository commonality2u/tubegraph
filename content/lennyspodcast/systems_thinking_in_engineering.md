[[Nonlinear and complex systems thinking in business | Systems thinking]] is an approach that encourages analyzing how different components of a system interact and influence each other over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. It involves understanding "stocks" (things that accumulate) and "flows" (movement between stocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. While powerful, it's crucial to remember that "reality is never wrong, your model is always wrong if it's in conflict with reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This conflict or "gap" is where learning occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Core Concepts
At its heart, [[Nonlinear and complex systems thinking in business | systems thinking]] involves:
*   **Stocks and Flows** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>:
    *   **Stocks:** Quantities that accumulate, like the number of fish in a lake or the number of people fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
    *   **Flows:** The movement into or out of a stock. For example, fish reproduction as an inflow and fishing as an outflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Interactions:** Understanding how these stocks and flows evolve over time due to various influencing factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. A classic example is how carcinogens concentrate up a food chain, leading to unexpected changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Application in Engineering
[[Nonlinear and complex systems thinking in business | Systems thinking]] can be applied to model various engineering and business processes:

### Hiring Pipeline Example
To apply [[Nonlinear and complex systems thinking in business | systems thinking]] to a hiring pipeline, one would model it using stocks and flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
1.  **Stocks:** Include potential candidates, sourced candidates, candidates who passed the recruiter screen, candidates who passed the hiring manager screen, and those who received offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
2.  **Flows:** Represent the conversion rates between these stages, such as the rate at which potential candidates are sourced (influenced by the number of sourcers) or the conversion rate from an offer to acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

By visualizing this model and comparing it with historical data from an applicant tracking system (like Greenhouse), an organization can identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. For instance:
*   A high number of candidates reaching the offer stage but few converting to accepted offers might indicate an issue with hiring managers' conviction or offer competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   A low number of candidates entering the pipeline despite good conversion rates at later stages points to a sourcing problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

This approach helps diagnose problems based on data rather than intuition, preventing misdirected efforts on "big changes with no data behind them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## Downsides and Misconceptions
Despite its utility, [[Nonlinear and complex systems thinking in business | systems thinking]] has pitfalls:
*   **"Reality is Wrong" Fallacy:** Some advocates become so engrossed in their models that when reality conflicts with the model, they believe reality is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. It's crucial to remember that "reality is always right; your model is always wrong if it's in conflict with reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Over-Prioritizing Measurement:** As seen in Stripe's incident management, teams can get "so caught up in the analysis that we sort of lost track of whether we're actually improving things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. The goal is to prioritize improvements, not just endless measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. You must "cut at some point to actually make impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Learning and Improvement
To get better at [[Nonlinear and complex systems thinking in business | systems thinking]], it's recommended to:
*   **Read *Thinking in Systems* by Donella Meadows:** This book provides a foundational understanding of the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Model Reality:** A key part of [[Developing engineering strategy | strategy]] is the ability to model reality to improve your diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   **Embrace Imperfection:** Be comfortable measuring something that is not perfect, as it provides a starting point for education and more sophisticated understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. Metrics are about educating people about the nuances of the underlying data, not about presenting a perfect data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>.

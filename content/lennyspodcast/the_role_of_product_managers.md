Nikhil Singall, a product leader with experience at companies like Facebook, Credit Karma, and Google, shares insights into the multifaceted [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product management]] career and what it takes to succeed at various stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Defining a Product Manager's Career
A career in [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product management]] should be viewed as a product itself, with an end state in mind, broken down into versions or stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The focus should be on the job after the next, or even the boss's boss's job, to understand what needs to be considered to reach that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Avoiding Short-Term Thinking
One common mistake for aspiring and early-career [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product managers]] is being too short-term focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Examples of short-term thinking include disliking one's boss, feeling a company isn't going anywhere, or perceiving difficulty in shipping products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Lateral moves, by definition, are not forward moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Another common pitfall is conflating career progression with promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. While promotion is a company's system for advancement, a true career path involves a long-term arc, considering goals beyond the immediate next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### The Value of Diverse Experiences
Collecting impressive company "logos" on a resume can feel shallow to those who enjoy building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. A diverse set of experiences is highly beneficial for a [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product manager]], including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>:
*   Pre-product market fit environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   Scaling a product from "smoke to fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   Turning a successful product into something great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   Solving internal "building problems" versus external "customer problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   Working on consumer products versus business-to-business products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

These varied experiences contribute to becoming a better "builder" and lead to greater career satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. While having "Magma" (Meta, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) company experience can unlock opportunities, especially for executives, diverse experiences are often more valuable for overall development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### Avoiding "Ex-Growth" Companies
"Ex-growth" companies are those that raised substantial capital during periods of hyper-growth but now struggle to find true product-market fit or sustained growth in a changed economic landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. These companies may still be hiring, but their valuations are often inflated compared to their current stage, leading to a situation where employee equity may not be worth much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

Signs of an ex-growth company include:
*   Reframing the core product to find product-market fit, while maintaining a valuation of hundreds of millions or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   Requiring significant marketing effort to acquire users, rather than experiencing natural "pull" or "sucking sound" from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

For employees, staying at such a company often offers "almost no recourse" due to the likely devaluation of equity and the opportunity cost of lost time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. However, potential reasons to stay might include:
*   Access to a significant role (e.g., executive team) that wouldn't be available elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.
*   Strong loyalty and commitment to the team or the "baby" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

## Key Focus Areas for Product Managers

### Early Career: Developing a "World-Class" Skill and Story
Early-career [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product managers]] should aim to become world-class in at least one area of product ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>:
*   **Crafter**: Strong at execution and detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.
*   **Market Ambiguity Expert**: Navigating markets and creating new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.
*   **Organizational Ambiguity Expert**: Solving internal problems with complex teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.
*   **Domain Expert**: Specializing in areas like ML or hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
*   **Team Expert**: Excelling at managing managers and team balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Growth Expert**: Understanding and driving growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

Picking a "lane" and becoming an expert early on is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Additionally, every [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product manager]] should craft a compelling story about their contributions and learnings for future employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This means proactively thinking about the narrative of their work, skills built, challenges overcome, and personal impact (using "I" not "we") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a>.

### Mid-Career: Understanding Promotion and Feedback
If a [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product manager]] is not getting promoted, there are typically four underlying reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>:
1.  **Lack of Advocacy**: No one within the organization sees or advocates for their "magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. This may necessitate a project shift, a new manager, or even leaving the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.
2.  **No Next Role**: The next position or level simply doesn't exist within the company's current structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. This is increasingly common in a market with widespread layoffs and restructuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
3.  **Impatience**: High performers often set aggressive promotion goals, but leadership roles take longer to absorb and are based on lagging impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
4.  **Development Area**: There's a genuine area for development that isn't being clearly communicated or accepted by the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

To address a perceived lack of recognition, individuals must seek "real feedback" beyond formal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. This involves:
*   Actively pulling feedback and listening without immediately justifying one's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.
*   Triangulating feedback from peers and those with different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
*   Creating a safe environment for feedback, where people feel no worry about retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
*   Repeating feedback back to the giver to confirm understanding and show appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
*   As a manager, publicly acknowledging and thanking individuals who provide valuable feedback to encourage others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

### Transitioning to Management
The tech industry has historically failed to adequately train managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>, often promoting individuals based on their individual contributor skills rather than managerial aptitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. This creates a "massive epidemic" of challenges related to bias, coaching, and addressing development areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

For new managers, two critical aspects to master are:
1.  **Sharing the Steering Wheel**: Management is not about simply dividing and conquering or letting go once someone is trained. It's more like a sidecar on a motorcycle, where the manager provides counsel and shares responsibility, rather than entirely handing over control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.
2.  **Being Invited In**: Managers possess organizational power, but they must "earn the right" to be someone's manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. This means asking how they can help and waiting for an invitation to assist, rather than imposing their authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

### The Rise of the Individual Contributor (IC) Path
The individual contributor (IC) path, particularly for senior roles, is becoming increasingly viable and is considered one of the "best things to happen to our industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. This shift is partly due to the scaling back of rapid growth and the focus on core products, leading to fewer management layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.

Historically, [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product managers]] often felt compelled to become managers, unlike engineers or designers who have long-established IC tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. The IC path allows individuals to deepen their expertise in a specific area of ambiguity (e.g., market, domain) rather than diverting into management responsibilities that may detract from their "builder" instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. While still developing, the IC track is expected to solidify and become a strong, permanent option for builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

## Late Career: The Shadows of Superpowers
Senior leaders often face a unique challenge: their greatest "superpowers" can cast "shadows" that become development areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. What got them to their current position isn't necessarily what will enable them to succeed at the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.

Examples of superpowers and their shadows include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>:
*   **Great Collaborators**: May struggle when their opinions are required as a leader, especially if collaboration previously meant others agreed with their viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>. Conversely, some may be too reticent to present their own opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.
*   **Growth Experts**: May struggle with innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.
*   **World-Class Storytellers**: May struggle with getting into the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.
*   **Tastemakers (strong opinions)**: May not introduce change often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>.
*   **Politically Strong**: Decisions may become unprincipled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.
*   **Structured Thinkers**: May struggle with blue-sky innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.
*   **Amazing Listeners**: May be weak in decisiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

The challenge is that these development areas are often deeply tied to an individual's identity and perceived strengths, making them difficult to recognize and address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. To overcome this, leaders must actively listen to contradictory feedback, especially from trusted sources, and not dismiss it as anomalous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.

## The Long-Term Career and Well-being
Modern careers can span 60-70 years, meaning many professionals are only halfway through their working lives at age 40 or 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. A common issue is that individuals reach their initial "North Star" (e.g., Vice President, starting a company) and then feel lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. This is akin to greyhounds that, once they catch the mechanical rabbit they've been chasing, never run again because their singular goal has been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.

To avoid this "sadness" and maintain motivation, individuals need to develop a "second thing" or a new North Star for their later career stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. These "Act 3" career paths often fall into two categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>:
1.  **Scaled Economics**: A focus on increasing wealth through investing, private equity, etc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
2.  **Giving Back**: A focus on contributing to others, whether through content creation, volunteering, or mission-driven ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. While "taking" and "creating" are important in earlier career stages, "giving" often leads to greater fulfillment in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

## Community and Continuous Learning
Nikhil Singall emphasizes the power of community for learning and growth in [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. These communities provide safety, authenticity, and shared best practices, helping individuals feel less alone in their [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_product_management | challenges and responsibilities in product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. His own "The Skip" community for Chief Product Officers exemplifies this by connecting like-minded individuals to discuss common dilemmas and share solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.

He also suggests that managing the "meeting operating system" like a product (e.g., "version 7") can significantly improve a team's ability to execute, especially in scaled organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>. This focus on process, particularly for new leaders with low context, can reveal inefficiencies and enhance delegation and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.

Ultimately, every [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product manager]] should continuously work on building a compelling career story, one that is personally meaningful and sets them up for future "skips" to new, fulfilling roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>.

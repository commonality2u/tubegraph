The field of product management is undergoing significant changes, partly due to the rise of AI. While the fundamental principles of product management are expected to remain stable, the techniques employed are experiencing radical shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>.

## Initial Concerns and Disruptive Potential

The predicted [[impact_and_challenges_of_ai_in_product_management | impact of generative AI]] is one of the biggest factors creating uncertainty among company leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The CEO of Nvidia even suggested that people should not learn programming due to AI's advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. While the exact time horizon for these changes remains uncertain, the belief is that AI will have a very real [[impact_of_ai_on_skills_and_products | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

Indeed, it is anticipated that [[overcoming_challenges_in_ai_product_management | generative AI]] will compound the "reckoning" faced by certain product management roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Product Management Techniques

Initially, advice on using AI tools like ChatGPT for product management suggested starting with AI-generated content and then refining it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>. However, this advice has evolved due to people trusting AI results too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. The current recommendation is to first think through the answer, put something down, and then use AI to improve, challenge, or tighten the argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.

AI can be used for various product management documents, including:
*   Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>
*   Strategy documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>
*   Even tasks like writing bug reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>

## Evolving Skills for Product Managers

The core skills of an "empowered product manager" – responsibility for value and viability – are expected to remain critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>. However, the specific techniques used within these areas will continue to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.

Product managers need to [[impact_of_ai_on_skills_and_products | uplevel their skills]] to remain relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. This means focusing on:
*   Becoming an expert on users and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   Expertise in data, understanding how the product is used, how usage changes, and how it's purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
*   Representing compliance, sales, marketing, financial cost, monetization, and legal constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
*   Bringing a deep understanding of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

## The Future of Vulnerable Roles

Roles that are primarily administrative or focused on backlog management are most vulnerable to AI disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. If a product manager's primary function is "backlog administrator," that role will become "pretty well supported" by AI over time, making it a poor job prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>. Similarly, many administrative tasks performed by "feature team product managers" will be significantly aided by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.

The traditional "product owner" role, often focused on managing a backlog in Jira, is seen as a task that even a senior engineer could often perform better, and AI will further automate such functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

## AI's Role in Product Viability

For empowered product managers, the [[role_of_ai_in_product_teams | challenge remaining]] with AI is primarily related to **viability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. Viability refers to whether a solution works for the business, including sales, marketing, legality, serviceability, and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

The [[future_implications_of_ai_for_product_management | implications of probabilistic software]] (AI) versus deterministic software introduce complex questions around legal and ethical perspectives, and whether AI is suitable for mission-critical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. These are viability and value questions that will increasingly land squarely on the product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>.

While AI promises to transform many aspects of product development, the human element of critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>, problem-solving, and ensuring products are valuable and viable for both customers and the business remains paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

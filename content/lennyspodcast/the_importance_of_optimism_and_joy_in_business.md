In the realm of business, the prevailing aesthetic often favors sophistication, metrics, and a serious demeanor. However, a deeper look reveals that unquantifiable elements like optimism, fun, and delight are incredibly powerful drivers of success and outperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Challenging the Conventional Aesthetic
The traditional image of business people often involves suits, sophisticated language, a lack of accent, and a focus on charts and presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. This aesthetic frequently suggests that pessimism sounds sophisticated, while [[building_a_culture_of_speed_and_optimism | optimism]] always sounds "dumb or at least naive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Metrics-driven approaches are seen as sophisticated, while talking about fun sounds naive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

However, this conventional view may be misleading. The world is often "stacked to lead us astray based on our stories about what optimal looks like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. In reality, almost all the "alpha" (exceptional returns) in the business world is found in things that are unobvious but true, which are often dismissed as naive or silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. Figures like Elon Musk demonstrate that successful business leaders do not always conform to traditional ideas of what a sophisticated business person ought to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

## The Power of Unquantifiable Metrics
Shopify operates with a comfort for unquantifiable aspects of business, such as:
*   Taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   Quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>
*   Passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>
*   Love and Hate (strong emotions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>
*   The deep satisfaction a craftsperson feels after a job well done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>

While quantifiable metrics are important and widely used for analysis and system monitoring, they often serve a support function rather than defining goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Focusing solely on the quantifiable leads to "overfitting" and misses 80% of the value space available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

The most powerful unquantifiable things in business are fun and delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. If employees are having fun, even if initial metrics are pointing down, they will likely start going up with time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of emotional states within the company.

## The Role of Leaders in Cultivating Care
The ultimate quality of any product is a direct reflection of "how much the people who created it gave a shit about the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:19">[01:37:19]</a>. It's impossible to create great products if the team working on them lacks genuine care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:27">[01:37:27]</a>.

Product leaders have a crucial role in fostering this care within their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">[01:37:34]</a>. This can be achieved by:
*   **Building empathy for users:** Helping the team understand and connect with the people who will be using their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:43">[01:37:43]</a>.
*   **Infectious enthusiasm:** The product leader themselves must "exothermically" and infectiously care about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. This single factor can make a product ten times better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:15]</a>.

It is advised not to engage in product work if you do not genuinely care about it, as you will not be able to produce the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:53">[01:37:53]</a>. This underscores that focusing on core emotions and intrinsic motivation rather than solely on strategic documents or stakeholder alignment leads to superior products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>.

Enthusiasm is also considered the best marketing, indicating its broad impact beyond just internal team dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:08">[01:34:08]</a>.

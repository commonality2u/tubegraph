This article discusses the fundamental [[feature_teams_vs_empowered_product_teams | differences between Feature Teams and Empowered Product Teams]] in product development, drawing heavily on insights from Marty Cagan.

## Feature Teams

In a [[feature_teams_vs_empowered_product_teams | Feature Team]], the approach to product development is often characterized by a top-down, output-focused model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

Key characteristics of [[feature_teams_vs_empowered_product_teams | Feature Teams]]:
*   **Roadmap-driven** Typically handed a roadmap consisting of a prioritized list of features and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. These features are essentially possible solutions dictated by stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Role of Team** The team's primary task involves design, coding, quality assurance (QA), and deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Their general purpose is to serve the business by cranking out features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Product Manager Role** The [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product Manager]] in a [[feature_teams_vs_empowered_product_teams | Feature Team]] primarily acts as a "cat herder" or project manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Their responsibilities include organizing, gathering, and documenting requirements (e.g., PRDs, user stories) for sprint planning and ensuring delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This role is largely administrative, often leading to a lack of necessary skills for true product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

## Empowered Product Teams

In contrast, [[feature_teams_vs_empowered_product_teams | Empowered Product Teams]] operate with a more autonomous and outcome-oriented approach, focusing on solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

Key characteristics of [[feature_teams_vs_empowered_product_teams | Empowered Product Teams]]:
*   **Problem-focused** Instead of feature roadmaps, teams are given problems to solve, which can be customer or company problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The team is then equipped with the skills to find the best solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Outcome-oriented** Success is measured by outcomes—whether the problem is solved—rather than output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Celebrating a solution to a problem is prioritized over simply making a release, which may not achieve desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Peer Environment** Developers and designers are true peers, not just implementers of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Engineers contribute to great solutions, and designers focus on creating great experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Both are expected to care as much about *what* is built as *how* it's built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **[[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product Manager]]'s Role** The [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product Manager]]'s job is significantly more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. They are responsible for leading [[managing_discovery_and_delivery_in_product_teams | product discovery]] to ensure the solution is valuable, usable, feasible, and viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Specifically, the [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product Manager]] owns the valuable and viable aspects of the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This requires bringing unique skills and knowledge to the team, including:
    *   **Users and Customers** Deep understanding of users and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.
    *   **Data Expertise** Proficiency in product usage data, sales analytics, and user analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.
    *   **Business Acumen** Knowledge of marketing, sales, monetization, compliance, regulatory, privacy, and security issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.
    *   **Competitive Landscape** Awareness of industry trends and competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.
*   **Strategic Context** Teams require a clear understanding of the product vision, strategy, and how their work aligns with other teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **Discovery Skills** [[managing_discovery_and_delivery_in_product_teams | Product teams]] need to master [[managing_discovery_and_delivery_in_product_teams | discovery techniques]] such as prototyping and testing to find reasons users *won't* use a product, rather than just seeking validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. Key resources for learning these skills include *Continuous Discovery Habits* by Teresa Torres and *Sprint* by Jake Knapp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

## Misconceptions and [[Challenges in product management | Challenges]]

A significant misconception is that a [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product Manager]]'s job is solely to define "what" to build, not "how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. However, determining value and viability are integral parts of "how" a solution is built and are core [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product Manager]] responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

### The "Disease" of Companies
Steve Jobs identified a "disease" in companies where product historically becomes less important as companies grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Leaders from marketing, sales, and finance become celebrated, leading good product people to leave for companies that value product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. This results in companies stopping real [[managing_discovery_and_delivery_in_product_teams | discovery]], often due to fear of hurting existing business, and instead focusing on low-risk optimizations or small A/B tests that do not drive major innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

Another "disease" is the belief among managers that an idea constitutes 90% of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. They fail to understand that the true craftsmanship lies in the [[managing_discovery_and_delivery_in_product_teams | product discovery]] process, where ideas evolve through constant iteration and trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. This often results in executives dictating features, even though only about 20% of such dictated features yield positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

### Process People
A significant [[Challenges in product organizations | challenge in product organizations]] is the "disease of process people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. While scaling is difficult, relying on process instead of leaders for scaling often leads to poor outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. Some methodologies, despite being marketed as agile, are criticized for being repackaged waterfall models that do not align with true agile principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>. Marty Cagan stresses that process is never the answer for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>.

## Transitioning to an Empowered Product Team Model

For a [[feature_teams_vs_empowered_product_teams | Feature Team]] to transition to an [[feature_teams_vs_empowered_product_teams | Empowered Product Team]], it's recommended to start with an experiment for a quarter or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

Key steps for a team:
1.  **Shift Focus from Features to Problems** Instead of building a feature, identify the underlying problem to solve. Stakeholders should be asked about the desired success metrics (KPIs) to understand the problem they are trying to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.
2.  **Product Manager Preparedness** The [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product Manager]] must develop the necessary skills, which include becoming an expert on users/customers, knowing product data, understanding business aspects, and being aware of the competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
3.  **Ensure Strategic Context** The team needs to understand the larger product vision and strategy to make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
4.  **Acquire Discovery Skills** Learn and apply modern [[managing_discovery_and_delivery_in_product_teams | discovery techniques]] through resources like *Inspired* and *Continuous Discovery Habits* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

### Sacred Responsibilities of a Product Manager
Regardless of the team model, there are three sacred responsibilities for a [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product Manager]] that should never be delegated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>:
1.  **Unencumbered access to users and customers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>. Intermediaries like customer success or sales can hinder a [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product Manager]]'s understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>.
2.  **Unencumbered access to engineers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. Working directly with engineers on problem-solving is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>. Roles like [[Distinctions between product owners and product managers | Product Owners]] or project managers acting as interfaces can stifle innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.
3.  **Unencumbered access to stakeholders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>. This ensures the product addresses business needs effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>.

While other responsibilities like project management, quality assurance, [[communicating_benefits_versus_features_in_product_marketing | product marketing]], or runtime operations can be delegated, compromising these three core access points can cause significant damage to product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. For example, Product Ops is beneficial if it supports productivity or handles runtime issues, but detrimental if it separates the [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product Manager]] from essential data or customer insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.

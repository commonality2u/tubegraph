A growth model is an analytical representation of how a business grows, typically built in a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Its primary value lies in forcing a deep understanding of how a business operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. It serves as an artifact to weigh different opportunities and understand the benefits of various initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. While not a forecasting tool, it is excellent for opportunity assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

It can be thought of as a formula, often in Excel, that summarizes and integrates the various elements driving a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Building a Growth Model

The process of building a growth model should involve a smart analyst or finance person partnering to iterate on the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The more challenging the building process, the more learning occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

### Core Components for Most Businesses
The fundamental building blocks for most businesses include:
*   **Acquisition Channels**: Understanding sources of traffic, associated spend, and conversion rates (e.g., paid marketing, sales, viral referrals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Retention**: How customers activate and their retention curve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: How revenue is generated from customers (e.g., monthly fees, transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Model Archetypes

#### SaaS Business Model
A relatively simple SaaS business model typically requires only the three core components: acquisition, retention, and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

#### Transactional Business Model
For transactional businesses, additional layers are needed:
*   **Transaction Frequency**: How many transactions per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Average Order Value (AOV)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Unit Economics**: Crucial due to potentially higher costs of goods sold (COGS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

#### Marketplace Business Model
For marketplaces, both demand and supply sides need to be modeled, along with their interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This includes supply acquisition and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Non-Linear Growth
The model becomes more interesting when incorporating non-linear elements:
*   **Virality**: Existing customers referring new ones, influencing business growth speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Reinvestment**: Reinvesting contribution margin from paid marketing to acquire more customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This highlights why payback period is a better measure of paid marketing performance than LTV to CAC, as it focuses on the speed of recouping investment for reacquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## Challenges and Nuances in Building Growth Models

Models can "go off the rails" if not built carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. A key challenge is the accumulation of assumptions, particularly in marketplaces where two sides of the business are modeled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The interaction between supply and demand is especially difficult to understand and quantify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This can lead to a "junk in, junk out" problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

Instead of a single, complex master model, it's often more effective to:
1.  **Conceptual Model**: Build a basic, high-level conceptual model that simply describes how the overall system works to understand key levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
2.  **Mini-Models**: Each product pod or go-to-market team should have its own mini-model detailing the inputs that drive their specific North Star metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## Leveraging a Growth Model

A growth model is a valuable input for quarterly or annual planning processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. It provides a "common currency" to compare and trade off the efforts of different teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. By running scenarios through the model, teams can articulate how their work impacts short- or long-term growth, leading to better resource allocation decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

## Key Learnings from Growth Models

### The Power of Retention
Growth is exceptionally sensitive to customer retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Even small percentage gains in retention are often far more valuable than larger changes in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, potentially revealing misallocated product and growth resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

For example, at Thumbtack, building a growth model revealed the extreme sensitivity to the repeat rate of new customers. While the team initially focused heavily on optimizing initial SEO and conversion rates, the model showed the greater impact of improving customer LTV through cross-selling and lifecycle management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This led to a significant shift of resources from top-of-funnel to deeper in the stack, improving the customer journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

### Focus on Early User Experience
Retention is a culmination of the entire product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Instead of directly trying to "move a retention style metric" with push notifications or emails, the focus should be on understanding and improving the core customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

The biggest wins in retention often come from inflecting the early user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. In the first few weeks or months, there is a significant opportunity to teach customers about the product's value and prove its utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. It's crucial to identify and address variability in this early experience. For instance, Uber and Lyft focus on guaranteeing high first-week earnings for drivers to "homogenize" the initial experience and pull below-average experiences up to the average, leading to better retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

#### Caution Against Resurrection Efforts
Working on early user experience is highly impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. It is generally more challenging to "resurrect" churned users because they have already tried the product and decided against using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. Therefore, focus on new user acquisition and early funnel optimization before engaging in resurrection efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

#### Limitations of Correlational Exercises
A common analytical failure mode is to observe that "best users do X" and then attempt to make other users do the same thing to drive future retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. This rarely works because there is often a unique underlying reason for certain customer behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Focus instead on understanding the true drivers of value and creating strong first-run experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

[[framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | Finding Product-Market Fit (PMF)]] is considered the single most crucial task for a startup within its first three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is often underexplored and underexplained as a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. A framework developed by First Round Capital aims to provide a practical and actionable approach for [[Product market fit techniques | founders]] and product teams to achieve PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This framework is particularly suited for early B2B sales-led founders, ideally within the first six to nine months of starting their company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. The goal is to increase the odds of success and reduce the role of luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Defining Product-Market Fit

[[Product market fit techniques | Product-Market Fit]] is not a sudden, overnight event, nor is it a one-size-fits-all concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. For B2B companies, it tends to follow a repeatable pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to achieve "Extreme Product-Market Fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

Extreme Product-Market Fit is defined as:
> "A state of widespread demand for a product that satisfies a critical need and crucially can be delivered repeatably and efficiently to each customer." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>

This definition highlights three key dimensions:
*   **Demand:** The widespread need or desire for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Satisfaction:** The degree to which the product fulfills a critical customer need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Efficiency:** The ability to deliver the product repeatably and at a viable economic model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

Efficiency is often overlooked in traditional definitions of PMF, but it's crucial for long-term viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The " $100 vending machine" example illustrates this: immense demand and satisfaction for a product that gives $100 for $1, but it's not viable due to inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. As a company progresses, the marginal customer should become easier to acquire and serve, indicating increased efficiency and strengthening PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

It's important to note that these three dimensions require trade-offs at different stages of PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## [[Stages of productmarket fit | Four Levels of Product-Market Fit]]

Product-Market Fit typically unfolds over multiple years, often taking four to six years for the best Enterprise companies to reach extreme PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The framework defines four levels:

### Level 1: Nascent Product-Market Fit

*   **Goal:** Find three to five customers with an important and urgent problem, and deliver a satisfying solution that fulfills a deep promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Focus:** **Satisfaction** first, then Demand, then Efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. It's acceptable to be inefficient at this stage if it leads to incredible customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Company Profile:** Pre-seed or seed stage, less than 10 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Demand Source:** Primarily personal network (friends, family, VCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Cold outreach is difficult, requiring roughly 20 warm intros to get one sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue:** \$0 to \$500K ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **Metrics:** Efficiency metrics (burn multiple, gross margin, NRR) are not applicable or a primary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of progress, customers needing what's being built, and the product working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   **Timeline:** Ideally, 12 to 18 months spent here to really nail the problem and persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

#### Signs of Being Stuck at Level 1

*   Customers wouldn't be very disappointed if the product disappeared overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   A handful of happy customers, but the most important feature differs for each, resembling a consulting business rather than a scalable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   Incredibly hard to find the next new customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   Low product usage or slow growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   Lingering for 6, 9, or 12 months with yellow flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   The "friendzoned" feeling: customers like the product but don't *need* it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Founders should ask customers if the product is a *necessity* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

#### Examples of Level 1 Progression/Pivots

*   **Vanta:** Initially explored other ideas (e.g., B2B Alexa) before finding a critical problem for startups: compliance automation, specifically SOC 2 certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Christina Copo, the founder, manually completed spreadsheets for early customers (e.g., Segment, Front, Figma) to prove the value proposition of unlocking revenue by enabling them to land Enterprise deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This highlights extreme satisfaction with total inefficiency, which is acceptable at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Lattis:** Started as an OKR tool in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Customers would use it for one quarter but then churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The founder, Jack Altman, kept the "Persona" (Heads of HR) but changed the "Problem" and "Promise" to Performance Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. He sold the first 5-10 customers with Figma mockups, demonstrating the power of a strong promise before building the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This highlights a pivot using the [[framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | Four Ps]] (see below) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### Level 2: Developing Product-Market Fit

*   **Goal:** Grow from 5 satisfied customers to 25 satisfied customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Focus:** Now prioritize **Demand** alongside Satisfaction. The product itself must start doing "heavy lifting" to scale beyond initial willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Company Profile:** Seed or Series A stage, up to 20 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Demand Source:** Beyond warm intros, starting to invest in scalable channels like cold outreach, content, or community events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Conversion:** Sales conversion (first call to close-won) without warm intros is around 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue:** \$500K to \$5M ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Magic Number:** 0.5 to 0.75 (New ARR / CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Regretted Churn:** Okay if 10-20%, but not higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
    *   **NRR (Net Revenue Retention):** At least 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
    *   **Gross Margin:** Not worse than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Burn Multiple:** Not worse than 5x (Burn / New ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
*   **Feeling:** The marginal customer is getting easier to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>, but it's still not easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

#### Signs of Being Stuck at Level 2

*   Customers are happy, but having trouble opening demand floodgates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   Regretted churn is greater than 20% (satisfaction warning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   Sales cycles are too long, losing deals late in the funnel, or losing to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   Lack of urgency from customers, or struggling to hit desired price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a> (e.g., customers saying "we don't have the budget" or "not the right time" often means no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>).
*   Stuck for 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

#### Examples of Level 2 Progression/Pivots

*   **Looker:** Spent a long time at Level 1, with the founder, Lloyd Tabb, acting as a consultant to model customer data, as the product's value was only apparent once users saw their own data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This intense engagement led to 75% close rates and zero churn for initial customers, allowing them to scale rapidly from 5 to 25 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. They then focused on demand channels like SDRs and partner marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **Ironclad:** Initially struggled to sell as an "AI legal assistant" in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. A customer email asking "Are you a CLM?" (Contract Lifecycle Management) prompted a pivot in "Promise" (positioning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Ironclad shifted to marketing itself as an "AI-powered contract management software" within an existing, recognized category, which immediately resonated with buyers already looking for CLM solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. The founder even had a co-founder code a demo on a train ride to meet a potential client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

### Level 3: Strong Product-Market Fit

*   **Goal:** Achieve repeatability in growth, scaling from 25 customers to 100 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Focus:** Maintain Satisfaction and Demand while bringing **Efficiency** into sharp focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Company Profile:** Series B stage, 30 to 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   **Demand Source:** Cracked at least one scalable marketing and sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. At least 10% of inbound leads come from referrals and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. The company starts to become known for its product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue:** \$5M to \$25M ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Gross Margin:** Above 60%, ideally above 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
    *   **Burn Multiple:** Below 3x, ideally 1-3x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Regretted Churn:** Less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
    *   **NRR:** Greater than 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
*   **Feeling:** The "fish are jumping into the boat," the "rock is rolling down the hill," and leads are pouring in, often from unknown sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Life isn't necessarily easier; it's about scaling systems and keeping up with demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   **Timeline:** Roughly two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

#### Signs of Being Stuck at Level 3

*   Leaky bucket: NRR below 90% or regretted churn above 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
*   Growth is slowing down (e.g., struggling to do 2x growth after 3x growth in prior years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   Increased competition makes it harder to navigate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   Existing scalable channels are becoming saturated, requiring new channel discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   Growth comes at the cost of efficiency (e.g., high burn multiple) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

### Level 4: Extreme Product-Market Fit

*   **Goal:** Continue sustained growth by expanding Total Addressable Market (TAM) through new markets or multiple products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
*   **Focus:** Maintaining high Satisfaction, Demand, and Efficiency while innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **Company Profile:** Series C/D or beyond, more than 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   **Customers:** More than 100, aiming for 200, 300, or even thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue:** Beyond \$25M ARR, often aiming for \$100M ARR and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Sales Conversion (first call to close-won):** Better than 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Magic Number:** Greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
    *   **CAC Payback:** Less than 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Gross Margin:** Above 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Burn Multiple:** Ideally less than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.
    *   **Churn:** Less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
    *   **NRR:** Greater than 120% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
*   **Feeling:** A valuable company, often a unicorn, striving to become a decacorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   **Timeline:** Approximately two years to go from \$25M to \$100M ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.
*   **Note:** Achieving PMF for new products or in new markets at this stage is still hard and requires repeating the PMF journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. Customer expectations continuously rise, so maintaining PMF is an ongoing battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

#### Examples of Level 4 Expansion

*   **Vanta:** Expanded from SOC 2 compliance to a "Trust Management Platform" including security questionnaires and vendor risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
*   **Verkada:** Started with cloud security cameras and expanded to alarms, smoke detectors, and badge readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.
*   **Stripe:** Beyond its core payments, developed products like Stripe Radar and Stripe Atlas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.
*   **Square:** Expanded from the Square stand to Cash App, Square Checking, and Square Loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

### Overall PMF Progression

Roughly 60-70% of companies get stuck at Level 1 or Level 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. The goal of frameworks like this is to increase the percentage of companies that make it to Level 3 or Level 4, where they have a real shot at building an awesome company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

## The [[framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | Four Ps]] (for Pivoting)

When a company is stuck at any level, especially Level 1 or 2, the "Four Ps" provide a structured way to think about pivoting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. All four elements must align: the product must deliver a promise that solves the problem of the persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

The Four Ps are:
1.  **Persona:** Who is the target customer? The market is a collection of people with money to pay for a product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. Founders need to deeply understand their persona, their challenges, goals, and how the product helps them succeed at their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Problem:** What critical problem is being solved for the persona? It must be an important and urgent problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
3.  **Promise:** How is the product being pitched or positioned? What is the core value proposition that resonates with the buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>?
4.  **Product:** What is the actual solution being offered? The product's job is to satisfy the first three Ps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

Founders can change one, some, or all of these Ps. For example, Lattis kept the Persona but changed the Problem and Promise, while Vanta changed all four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Plaid changed the Persona, Problem, and Promise, while keeping much of its original product code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

It is often easier to change the Persona, Problem, and Promise than to rebuild the Product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Some founders prefer to "sell it before I build it" to gain strong customer signals and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Pivoting may feel like throwing away progress, but a "200% pivot" might be necessary instead of just a 10% adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

## [[Customer interactions and productmarket fit | Dollar-Driven Customer Discovery]]

To understand the "Problem" and define a compelling "Promise," customer discovery should be "dollar-driven" to test the potential for customers to pay for a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. Customers are polite and not always good at predicting their future behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.

Key techniques for dollar-driven discovery:

*   **Identify Extreme Value:** Ask open-ended questions about top goals and challenges without leading them to your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. Avoid "happy ears" – don't just look for what supports your existing idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. Look for "wow" statements ("Does that really work? If that thing works, I'd sign up for the waitlist today!") or demonstrated interest (e.g., asking for a follow-up meeting, requesting to share a deck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
*   **Confirm Ability to Pay:**
    *   "Are you currently looking for a product like this or building something internally?" (Customers who know they have a problem, are looking for a solution, or have failed to build one themselves are ideal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.
    *   "Where would a budget for this come from?" (Ideally, an existing budget from a displaced tool or internal spending like engineering time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
    *   "How does your team make decisions on third-party tools?" (Look for a known, even if complex, decision-making process) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.
*   **Quantify Willingness to Pay:**
    *   "What's your budget for solving this?" or "What are you paying for this other tool?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>
    *   Use the "Fair, Expensive, Prohibitively Expensive" pricing questions:
        *   "What is a fair price you would pay for this thing I just described?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>

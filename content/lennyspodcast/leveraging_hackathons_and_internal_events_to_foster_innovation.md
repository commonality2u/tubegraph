Leveraging [[building_a_culture_and_platform_for_experimentation | hackathons]] and internal events is crucial for fostering [[innovation_within_large_organizations | innovation]] and maintaining an entrepreneurial spirit within a company. These events serve multiple purposes, from generating new product ideas to reinforcing company culture and building team cohesion.

### The Value of Internal Events
A company needs to stay entrepreneurial to remain competitive and define industry standards, constantly looking ahead of competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>. Internal events provide structured opportunities for this.

#### Maker Week (Internal Hackathon)
Maker Week is an internal hackathon where the entire company pauses for a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Its purpose is to give people "breathing space" to think ambitiously and look ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Key aspects and benefits of hackathons:
*   **Idea Generation:** Hackathons are excellent for generating new ideas and pushing "zero to one" projects from the bottom up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Company-Wide Participation:** It's a misconception that hackathons are only for engineers; anyone can have an idea and contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
*   **Building Momentum:** Individuals can "walk around" and ask colleagues to work on their ideas, using the hackathon to build momentum and grow a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Successful Outcomes:** Many monumental product launches at Figma, such as multi-edit, Jambot (an [[leveraging_ai_in_product_development | AI]] plugin), and the entire widgets platform, originated from hackathons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>.

#### Sales Kickoff (SKO) and Config
Larger, company-wide forums like Sales Kickoff (SKO) and Config (Figma's annual showcase) are vital for:
*   **Declaring Priorities:** They serve as platforms to declare company priorities for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.
*   **Building Internal Hype:** Showcasing early-stage products or ideas through demos can significantly build excitement and help people visualize the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. This also provides valuable product insights and fuels further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **External Hype:** Config, as a public event, aims to generate external excitement among users and the broader community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

#### The Figgies (Awards Ceremony)
The "Figgies" is an Oscar-style awards ceremony for the product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>. This event is key for:
*   **Appreciation and Celebration:** Making people feel appreciated for their work and unique contributions fosters a positive team environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
*   **Team Cohesion:** Celebrating diversity and quirks helps team members understand and connect with each other, even those they don't know well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
*   **Reinforcing Values:** It embodies the company's core value of "play," emphasizing that work and gatherings should be fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>.
*   **Building Trust:** Investing in culture-building activities like the Figgies helps establish trust between groups of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. This trust makes teams more durable during tough times, encouraging rallying and collaboration instead of disengagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>.
*   **Low Cost, High Impact:** Such events can be executed scrappily and at low cost, proving that they are worth the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>.

### Fostering an Entrepreneurial Culture
Companies should constantly facilitate and lead a culture where people are encouraged to be entrepreneurial, both in developing new products and improving internal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>.

This culture can be fostered through:
*   **"Run with it" Culture:** Figma embraces a "run with it" culture, encouraging individuals to sprint off in a direction, viewing it as a manifestation of company values rather than a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>.
*   **Bottoms-Up Approach:** Celebrating and acting on ideas pushed from the bottom up is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>.
*   **Optimism Bordering on Delusion:** Successful "zero to one" projects often require an almost "reality distortion field" where "no" is heard as "not yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>.
*   **Strategic Pitching:** When pitching ideas, especially in company-wide forums, focus on making the product feel real through visual communication and prototypes, even with minor changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>. This turns individual evangelization into a collective effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>.

### Operationalizing Ideas through Staging and Feedback
A multi-month "staging" or "dogfooding" process is key for spreading ideas and gaining investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:05">[01:27:05]</a>.
*   **Early Staging:** Putting products on an internal staging environment early allows for continuous feedback from across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:14">[01:27:14]</a>.
*   **Fostering Investment:** When employees provide feedback and see their suggestions implemented, they feel a sense of ownership, believing they "shaped that part of the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:23">[01:28:23]</a>.
*   **Collective Success:** This process creates a constant feedback loop and investment, ensuring that the entire company collectively drives towards success, as product development is a team sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:41">[01:28:41]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning:** The more a product is put in front of people, the more signal is received on its direction, leading to valuable learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.

### Cultivating an Entrepreneurial Mindset Individually
To drive [[innovation_within_large_organizations | innovation]] from within:
*   **Broaden Your Scope:** Don't limit your thinking to the project you're currently working on. Consider your "scope is the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> and identify ideas within your company's broader vision that you are passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Embrace Founding within a Company:** Anyone can "found" something, either from scratch or within an existing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. Founding internally can leverage existing distribution, technical, or platform advantages, and carries less risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.
*   **"Shout from the Rooftops":** If you have unique insights, it is your responsibility to share them widely to get others on the same page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>. This encourages others to contribute in a similar fashion, fostering an [[building_a_startup_culture | entrepreneurial culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>.

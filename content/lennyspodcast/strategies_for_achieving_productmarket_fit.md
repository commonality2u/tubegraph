Achieving [[Product Market Fit | product-market fit]] is crucial for a company's success and often leads to significant word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Jag Dugall, Chief Product Officer at NuBank, shares insights into how NuBank has approached this, emphasizing a deep understanding of customer pain points, a fanatical customer-centric culture, and disciplined measurement.

## The NuBank Approach to Product-Market Fit

NuBank's success, which includes being larger than Coinbase, Robinhood, Affirm, Sofi, and Lemonade combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> and having 80-90% of its growth through word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, stems from several core principles:

### Tapping into Deep Pain Points
NuBank targeted a significant pain point in Brazil where large incumbent banks were highly profitable but also widely disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This deep-seated dissatisfaction provided fertile ground for a new approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Fanatical Customer Love
A central cultural value at NuBank is the desire for customers to "love us fanatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This isn't just a slogan but an active intent that guides decisions, biasing in favor of the customer, even when faced with short-term financial pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This cultural tenet is so ingrained that 80-90% of employees can recite the company's five values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

The five values are:
1.  We want our customers to love us fanatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
2.  We are hungry and challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
3.  We build strong and diverse teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
4.  We pursue smart efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
5.  We think and act like owners, not renters, doing what is right even without being told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Building Fundamentally Different Products
NuBank aims to be "fundamentally different" rather than "incrementally better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This involves:
*   **Customer Discovery:** Focusing on customer discovery before building and innovating on their behalf, often observing unarticulated pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Hypothesis-Driven Research:** Teams should clearly articulate a hypothesis before research to guide feedback validation or invalidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. Product managers should have a point of view on what will excite customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   **Observing More Than Asking:** During user research, it's more effective to observe user behavior and ask indirect questions to uncover true pain points, rather than directly asking if they would like a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.
*   **Challenging Assumptions:** Product managers should play "devil's advocate" with customers, encouraging them to "sell" the product idea rather than being swayed by politeness or initial excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.
*   **Mock Press Releases:** Before dedicating engineers, teams draft an Amazon-style mock press release to clearly articulate why the customer should care about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Disciplined Measurement
NuBank rigorously measures [[Product Market Fit | product-market fit]] and customer satisfaction:

*   **[[Productmarket fit framework | Sean Ellis Score]]**: NuBank is a "fanatical follower" of the [[Product Market Fit Strategies by Rahul Vohra | Sean Ellis]] methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This involves asking customers, "How disappointed would you be if this product went away?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>
    *   A threshold of at least 40% (adjusted to 50% for Brazilians due to cultural politeness) saying "very disappointed" is required before scaling a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
    *   This score is used to identify cohorts who love the product most, guiding further iterations to expand that passionate user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.
    *   Product managers are encouraged to directly call 10 customers to gather qualitative insights, as this often reveals patterns faster than broad surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: NuBank tracks NPS maniacally, aiming for world-beating scores (often 70s-80s, sometimes 90s) and investigating any dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Churn:** Ensuring low churn is critical for a viral customer acquisition loop; otherwise, efforts become a "leaky bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Preventing Premature Scaling
A key lesson is not to scale a small problem, as it will become a "big mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. If a product isn't working at a small scale, continuous iteration and customer feedback are essential to get it right before scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. This discipline prevents the wasteful scenario where good execution is multiplied by a poor strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.

> "Good enough isn't good enough. Is it great enough?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>

## Strategic Clarity

Jag Dugall stresses the importance of clear strategy:

*   **Clarity over Rightness:** Echoing Kevin Systrom of Instagram, a strategy may not be perfectly right, but being clear allows for better course correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.
*   **Strategy is a Coherent Plan:** It's not an ambitious goal or aspiration, but a plan to apply strengths against a core problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. NuBank's initial strategy, for example, was to offer a no-fee credit card to young, urban Brazilian millennials who hated fees and lacked credit, leveraging a branchless, digital model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.
*   **Concentrated Bets:** Startups need to make concentrated, high-stakes bets rather than hedging, as this focus allows for rapid learning and traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.

### Cultivating Strategic Thinking
To develop [[Strategies for setting and deploying effective product strategies | strategic thinking]]:
*   **Take it Seriously:** Value strategy as a core competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **Utilize Frameworks:** Employ strategic frameworks like "Play to Win" or "Where to Play, How to Win" to guide decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.
*   **Practice with Courage:** Making hard choices and concentrating bets requires courage, especially in a startup environment where hedging can seem appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

## Category Design

NuBank believes that successful companies are typically in the "new category business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>. While entering an existing market, the mindset should still be to reinvent the category, not just incrementally improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

> "We're not trying to be incrementally better, we are trying to be fundamentally different." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>

## The Future of Fintech at NuBank

NuBank envisions a future for banking that is:
*   **Holistic:** Providing full financial solutions across various life stages (spending, saving, investing, borrowing, protecting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.
*   **Global on a Single Codebase:** Aiming to build the first global bank on a unified technology infrastructure to leverage scale and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.
*   **Social and Self-Driving:** Incorporating social mechanics for financial lives and automation to manage tasks like bill payments and savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.
*   **AI-Powered:** Leveraging AI to turbo-boost tasks, provide insights, and potentially offer a "personal banker" experience democratized for billions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. The goal is to solve "harshly unoptimized financial lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>. This requires an "AI-native mindset" rather than simply appending AI to existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>.

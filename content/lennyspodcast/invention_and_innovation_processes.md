## The Nature of Invention
While many people believe invention takes a significant amount of time, it may only require two hours once a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The more time-consuming aspect is the *expression* of a good idea, which can often take years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

Examples of ideas that took years to express and optimize include:
*   A newsletter, which required years of work to fully express the initial idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   Amazon Prime shipping, a 20-year-old idea that is still being improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   The Kindle, a decade-old idea that continues to get better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The key takeaway is that an individual doesn't need a multitude of good ideas to be perceived as highly inventive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Systematic Inventiveness

Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon who spent 15 years with the company, helped invent and run various significant products like Prime Video, the Amazon App Store, Prime Gaming, and Twitch Commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. He holds over 70 patents, all created during his time at Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

To invent systematically, two main components are crucial:
1.  **Expertise**: One must be somewhat of an expert in the area where they wish to invent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Without a knowledgeable background, efforts may be unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.
2.  **Dedicated Time**: People often fail to allocate dedicated time for thinking about invention, assuming ideas will spontaneously appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. To counter this, it's advised to:
    *   Get away from devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.
    *   Enter a room with the problem at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.
    *   Force concentration on existing knowledge and how to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

The most straightforward approach to invention is not to create something entirely new, but to combine two existing concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

### Example: Drone Delivery Patent
Ethan Evans patented a drone delivery system for Amazon where a truck without a top drives slowly through a neighborhood, and drones fly back and forth from the truck for deliveries, rather than drivers stopping at every house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. This idea came from combining thoughts on drones and delivery with military history knowledge of aircraft carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. This concept could also be extended to returns, where a drone could pick up packages from a porch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.

## [[innovating_within_large_organizations | Innovation at Amazon]]: The "Invention Machine"

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, identified himself primarily as an inventor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Bill Carr, co-author of *Working Backwards*, wished the book had been titled "The Invention Machine" because Bezos's goal for Amazon was to build the most inventive company that could systematically out-invent competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

At Amazon, much of [[product_management_and_innovation | innovation]] and work is focused on the optimizing phase rather than just the initial idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. This involves making products cheaper, better, and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. The evolution of Amazon Prime illustrates this: starting with two-day shipping, then one-day, then same-day, and expanding to include services like Prime Video, Prime Music, and Prime Gaming. Prime now offers around 25 different benefits, a result of continuous incremental optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. Bezos's aim was to make Prime a "no-brainer" for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.

## Importance of Speed and Iteration in [[innovative_product_development_strategies | Product Development]]

A core Amazon leadership principle, "Bias for Action," emphasizes that speed is crucial in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. Many decisions are reversible, making it important to move quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. In a competitive environment, being right is good, but being quick is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>. Companies must value speed and commit to action daily to avoid being outmaneuvered by faster, perhaps luckier, competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. This principle, however, requires balance, as over-gambling on speed can lead to mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.

### Lessons from [[innovative_product_launching_strategies | Launching]]

Reflecting on past mistakes, such as the Amazon App Store launch failure, Ethan Evans learned critical lessons for [[developing_and_launching_new_products_in_a_company | product development and launching]]:

*   **Avoid Surprise Launches**: Amazon historically favored surprise launches to avoid "vaporware" (announcing products that get delayed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. However, the problem with surprise launches is that you are often surprised by what doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Beta Testing**: It's better to shift towards extensive beta testing, even if it risks leaks through Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), than to launch a flawed product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>.

### The "New York Times Headline" Test
As a leader, it's important to consider if an action or decision could generate a negative "New York Times headline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. If an organization like Amazon experiences an outage or a major mistake, it instantly becomes news on major outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>. While not being paralyzed by fear, this mindset helps teams be extremely careful and avoid publicly damaging the company's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.

## Leadership and Ownership in Innovation

Amazon's leadership principles include "Ownership," which emphasizes taking responsibility for outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. Ethan Evans contributed to the specific phrasing of this principle, proposing the impactful seven words: "An owner never says that's not my job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This phrase became a part of the official leadership principle and remains to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>. This demonstrates that good ideas can influence a company from within, even at high levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>.

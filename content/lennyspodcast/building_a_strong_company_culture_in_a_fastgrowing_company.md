Whiz, a rapidly expanding security company, achieved \$100 million ARR just 18 months after its founding, making it the fastest-growing software company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. This incredible growth was achieved despite initial struggles and a significant pivot, highlighting the importance of a strong, adaptable company culture.

## Early Challenges and Product-Market Fit
When Ros Herberg joined Whiz as the first product manager, the company, initially named Beyond Networks, did not have a clear product idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. The founders were exploring network security, despite their background being in cloud security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

During this initial phase, the team held 10 to 15 meetings daily with potential customers, presenting their idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. Although customers often responded with "sounds interesting," these discussions lacked deep engagement or specific questions about pricing or purchasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Ros, as the product manager, found herself confused about what they were actually building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

### The "I Don't Understand" Culture
After several weeks of these unfruitful calls, Ros felt compelled to ask for clarification, despite fearing she was the only one who didn't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. This question led to a deep discussion among the founding team, revealing that they were biased towards hearing positive affirmations rather than truly listening for signs of deep enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.

This openness to vulnerability and direct questioning is a core aspect of Whiz's [[leadership_and_company_culture | culture]], which is described as flat and impact-driven, where all voices are heard regardless of seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.

This pivotal conversation led the company to shift its focus back to cloud security, an area where the founding team had extensive prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>.

### Signals of True Product-Market Fit
Once Whiz pivoted to cloud security, the customer conversations fundamentally changed. Instead of generic interest, customers began asking specific questions like:
*   "How are you pricing this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>
*   "When can we start doing a PO?" (Proof of Value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>
*   "I know exactly who I need to connect you to in my team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>

These "strong indications" demonstrated a clear customer "pull" for the product, rather than the company having to "push" sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. Even when Whiz asked a major Fortune 10 company to fill out a long list of technical questions to "buy time," the company returned the completed questionnaire the next day, indicating genuine commitment and desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>.

## Cultural Elements for Growth in a Fast-Scaling Environment

### Embracing the "Heat"
Whiz's growth journey illustrates how the "heat" or primary focus shifts within a fast-growing organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>:
*   **Product Kitchen**: In the earliest days, the focus is on creating a product that people want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a>.
*   **Engineering**: Once the idea is clear, the "heat" moves to engineering to build and make it work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a>.
*   **Sales**: After initial deals are closed, the focus shifts to sales to scale adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>. The founding team even handled sales themselves for the first few million in ARR, gaining invaluable insights before hiring a dedicated sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: When product-market fit is established and sales are functioning, the "heat" moves to marketing to drive awareness and pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:00">[28:58:00]</a>.

### Trust and Vulnerability
Whiz's founders, who have worked together for over two decades, operate with "complete trust" and clear domain understanding, enabling rapid decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:11:00">[52:11:00]</a>. This trust extends to employees, fostering a [[creating_and_maintaining_team_culture_and_passion | culture of loyalty]] by providing opportunities for impact regardless of title or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:55:00">[52:55:00]</a>.

Ros's transition from VP of Product to CMO exemplifies this trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33:00">[25:33:00]</a>. Despite having no prior marketing experience, her deep product and market understanding, coupled with the founders' trust, allowed her to lead the marketing efforts effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>.

### The "Dummy Explanation" for Scaling Communication
As companies scale, clarity of communication becomes paramount. Ros emphasizes the importance of a "dummy explanation" for product messages, reminding employees that customers don't live within the company's internal bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:50:00">[48:50:00]</a>. This means avoiding complex terminology, initials (e.g., CSPM), or internal jargon that outsiders wouldn't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:32:00">[47:32:00]</a>. Marketing serves as a crucial bridge between the deep technical product teams and the wider market, ensuring messages are clear and amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:41:00">[45:41:00]</a>.

### Being Okay with Failure
A key cultural trait at Whiz, particularly evident in Ros's journey, is an acceptance of failure and a willingness to take risks. In marketing, unlike product development, mistakes often have minimal long-term cost, allowing for rapid experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:42:00">[37:42:00]</a>.

For instance, Whiz's "Whiz of Oz" themed booth at the RSA security conference, a stark contrast to typical cybersecurity booths, aimed to create noise and stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:55:00">[38:55:00]</a>. This bold, unconventional approach, while initially scary, resulted in a five-fold increase in booth visitors compared to the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>. This willingness to "try everything" is vital for breakthrough success in [[scaling_a_company_culture_while_maintaining_user_trust | scaling brand awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:00">[38:07:00]</a>.

This mindset of being okay with failing, and still attempting challenging roles or strategies, is deeply ingrained in Whiz's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a>. It empowers employees to push boundaries and learn, fostering an environment where individuals are encouraged to "not know your limit if you don't try" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>.

## Continued Growth
Today, Whiz employs around 1,500 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:38:00">[53:38:00]</a>. The company continues to prioritize its independent path, believing it can become one of the biggest security companies globally by leveraging the fast-growing cloud security market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. Its unique culture, emphasizing trust, openness, and a willingness to embrace challenges, remains a cornerstone of its sustained growth.

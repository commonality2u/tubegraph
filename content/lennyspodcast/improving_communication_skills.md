Effective communication is a highly leveraged skill for product leaders, leaders, and people in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:15">[04:54:15]</a>. As Meta's CTO, Bos, stated, "Communication is the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:40">[05:05:40]</a>. Wes Ko, a communication expert, co-founded Maven, which facilitates live cohort-based courses, and recently launched her own course on executive communication and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>. She is regarded as one of the best teachers of communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:10">[05:19:10]</a>.

George Bernard Shaw's quote, "The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place," highlights a common challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:18">[01:46:18]</a>. Improving communication can significantly increase the likelihood of achieving desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:10">[08:35:10]</a>.

## Core Principles of Effective Communication

### Take Agency and Self-Reflect
Operators often explain things poorly and are surprised when people are confused or skeptical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. If the desired reaction isn't achieved, it's crucial to ask: "How might I be contributing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, "How could I explain this more clearly?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, or "How can I anticipate any questions they might have?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. It's about personal agency and controlling one's own behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:07">[07:56:07]</a>. If people aren't buying into ideas or acting as requested, it's likely a communication issue, not necessarily their fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:39">[08:11:39]</a>.

### Practice Like It's Game Day
Many operators save their best communication behavior for executives, often presenting to them only once a month or a few times a quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. This infrequent practice is insufficient for developing strong executive communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. Instead, treat every stakeholder as important, whether it's a cross-functional team member, manager, or direct report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. Don't waste anyone's time, just as you wouldn't waste a CEO's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

### Communication as a Means to an End
Communication broadly falls into two mediums: verbal (meetings, conversations, presentations) and written (emails, strategy docs, Slack messages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Communication should be seen as a means to an end, with the ultimate goal being to achieve the ideal outcome, such as securing buy-in, making team decisions, or moving to the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

## Key Communication Tactics and Frameworks

### Sales then Logistics
A common mistake is overestimating audience buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. People often jump directly into logistics (the "how" or process) when the audience hasn't even decided if they want to do the thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. A "sales note" aims to excite people and secure agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. Only after buy-in does it make sense to share logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.

For example, a head of operations struggled to get executive team members to submit weekly wins for a company-wide share-out because she led with the logistics (which document, time, format) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. Instead, she should have started by "selling" them on *why* they were doing it: to shine a light on team members, motivate them, and ensure the company recognizes their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

Even with busy executives who want to "get to the point," a brief "selling" phase is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. A 1-2 minute, or even a couple of sentences, reminder of "why are we doing this?" or "why does this matter?" can prevent cold starts and regressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. This addresses the "yes, yes, yes, next, next" mindset of leaders, who have many things on their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>. If a leader agrees early, "take the win" and move on, as continuing to talk might talk them out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.

### Be Concise (Not Just Brief)
Conciseness is about economy of words and the density of insight, not absolute word count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. A 300-word memo can be meandering, while a 1,000-word memo can be tight and concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.

Advice like "don't bury the lead" or "cut to the chase" assumes one already knows their core point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:00]</a>. The true bottleneck to conciseness is often a lack of clarity in one's own thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. The only consistent solution for conciseness is preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>.

### The Power of Preparation
For meetings, even 30 seconds to a minute of preparation—thinking about why you're there and what you want to communicate—can significantly improve focus and conciseness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>. This helps avoid rambling and ensures key points are delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>.

For writing, the main tactic is to simply remind yourself to be concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. Ask yourself how to reduce cognitive load for the reader and find tighter, clearer ways to phrase requests or present information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:04]</a>. Reading your own message at least once before sending is crucial; this often reveals areas for trimming or clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>.

### [[importance_of_concise_written_communication | The "Blast Radius" of Poorly Written Communication]]
A poorly written memo or Slack message can have a much larger impact than most people realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:00">[25:41:00]</a>. A confusing message sent to 15 people can lead to extensive back-and-forth communication, whereas a minute or two more spent on clarity could have allowed those 15 people to "be off to the races" immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>. This highlights the significant negative leverage of inefficient writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>.

### Signposting for Clarity
Signposting involves using specific words, phrases, or formatting to guide the reader and signal what's coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>. This is especially helpful for long documents, adding structure and indicating paragraph topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>.

Examples of signposting words include:
*   "For example..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>
*   "Because..." (to share rationale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>
*   "As a next step..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:00">[28:15:00]</a>
*   "First, second, third..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>

Signposting can also be used verbally, for instance, in product demos: "The most important part to pay attention to is..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>. This not only adds structure but also re-engages audience attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>.

### Mindful Formatting
Excessive formatting, like bolding 30% of a note, negates its purpose because if everything is highlighted, nothing stands out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>. Use formatting sparingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>.

Over-reliance on bullets and sentence fragments is also a common issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. While seemingly faster, it forces the reader to decipher meaning, ultimately taking longer and potentially being a "crutch" for underdeveloped ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>. If an idea is fully thought out, it should be easily expressible in a complete sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:00]</a>. This aligns with Amazon's six-page memo philosophy: if you can't articulate it in prose, you don't fully understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>.

### [[effective_listening_and_communication_as_a_leader | Anticipating Objections: The MOO Framework]]
MOO stands for "Most Obvious Objection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:25:00">[50:25:00]</a>. Many people feel blindsided by questions in meetings, but taking just two minutes to consider obvious objections can reveal common concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:51:00">[50:51:00]</a>. While you can't anticipate every objection, you can certainly prepare for the obvious ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:56:00">[50:56:00]</a>.

Knowing your argument inside and out, including counterarguments, helps prevent being caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:03:00">[51:03:00]</a>. Using MOO as a mental filter encourages thinking a few steps ahead in a structured way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:01:00">[52:01:00]</a>. This practice not only improves communication but also helps clarify one's own thinking, potentially revealing gaps in the initial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>.

### Finding the Right Level of Conviction
It's important to speak accurately about your level of conviction and the evidence you possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:12:00">[43:12:00]</a>.

*   **Overconfident:** Stating hypotheses as facts can lead to misallocated resources (e.g., headcount, budget) based on unsubstantiated claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:53:00">[42:53:00]</a>. It's acceptable to present an "initial hunch," but label it as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:24:00">[43:24:00]</a>.
*   **Underconfident:** Diminishing valuable recommendations (e.g., "you can ignore everything I just said") is irresponsible if you have strong reasons to believe in your proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>.

The right balance is to have a point of view and a recommendation, backing it with evidence, logic, first principles, and examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:11:00">[45:11:00]</a>. Clearly state when something is a hunch or theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>. This allows others to align or push back with specificity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:44:00">[45:44:00]</a>.

Avoid biasing data to push an agenda, as this erodes trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:12:00">[46:12:00]</a>. A "single-minded martyr" has an agenda and presents only supporting evidence, becoming frustrated when met with skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:54:00">[46:54:00]</a>. Instead, put your recommendations in the broader context of organizational priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:00:00">[48:00:00]</a>. Senior individuals understand that the best decision for the company might not be immediate prioritization or full investment in their proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:53:00">[48:53:00]</a>. Always prioritize what's best for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:04:00">[49:04:00]</a>.

### [[giving_feedback_and_making_apologies_effectively | Giving Effective Feedback: Strategy, Not Self-Expression]]
When giving feedback, the goal should be to motivate behavior change, not to express frustration or "vent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:07">[0:06:07]</a>. Cut 90% of what you initially want to say, keeping only the 10% that will make the person want to change and understand the benefit to themselves and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:12">[1:06:12]</a>. Prior to the conversation, vent frustrations to a third party (e.g., therapist, partner) to ensure you enter the discussion clear, grounded, and focused on the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:24">[1:07:24]</a>.

### [[effective_listening_and_communication_as_a_leader | Delegating with High Standards: The CEDAF Framework]]
The CEDAF framework helps ensure effective delegation while maintaining high standards:
*   **C - Comprehension:** Provide all necessary information for the person to understand the task and the desired end result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:19">[1:10:19]</a>.
*   **E - Excitement:** Explain the "why" behind the task to connect it to larger goals or the project's importance, fostering motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:45">[1:10:45]</a>.
*   **D - Derisk:** Anticipate obvious risks or misunderstandings and address them upfront. For instance, have them do a small portion first to test assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:08">[1:11:08]</a>.
*   **A - Align:** Provide opportunities for the other person to ask questions and confirm their understanding. This reveals what resonated and what needs clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:59">[1:11:59]</a>.
*   **F - Feedback:** Establish the shortest possible feedback loop. Instead of waiting a week, check in after a day, or even brainstorm initial steps during the delegation conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:42">[1:12:42]</a>.

Running through this checklist often highlights areas for improvement in the delegation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:26">[1:13:26]</a>. This framework, and much of the advice on communication, centers on making a small upfront investment to save significant time and effort later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:51">[1:13:51]</a>.

### Building a "Swipe File" for Inspiration
A "swipe file" is a collection of inspiration (phrases, words, well-articulated ideas, cool designs, effective strategy docs) that you can refer back to later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:11">[1:17:11]</a>. Even the act of adding to the file trains you to notice what's working well and prompts reflection on *why* it's effective, encouraging borrowing and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:47">[1:17:47]</a>. Keeping it simple (e.g., Apple Notes) encourages consistent use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:43">[1:19:43]</a>.

## Managing Up Effectively
The common myth is that managing up is only for junior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:59:00">[0:59:00]</a>. However, it becomes even more critical with increased seniority, as tasks become less defined and ambiguity increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:59:51">[0:59:51]</a>. Investing in this skill serves you throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:59:42">[0:59:42]</a>.

The most leveraged way to manage up is by sharing your point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:00:58">[1:00:58]</a>. Instead of asking "What should we do?", propose "Here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps? Am I thinking in the right direction?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:01:36">[1:01:36]</a>. This reduces your manager's cognitive load and demonstrates that you are an active, strategic thinker, not just waiting to be told what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:02:02">[1:02:02]</a>. Even junior people can and should do this, as they often have the most direct visibility into problems and customer issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:02">[1:03:02]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Communication
AI tools like Claude can be valuable thought partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:20">[1:20:20]</a>. They are useful for generating initial drafts, such as email replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:30">[1:20:30]</a>. Providing clear direction and sharing your point of view significantly improves the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:46">[1:20:46]</a>. For example, when asking AI to decline a request, explain the situation and desired tone (e.g., "respectful of our relationship," "decline nicely") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:10">[1:21:10]</a>. AI can also help by shortening feedback loops, often asking clarifying questions before completing a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:15:58">[1:15:58]</a>.

## General Advice for Improvement

### Focus on Outcomes and Speed
Evaluate communication effectiveness by observing how quickly and enthusiastically you get the desired reaction from recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:15">[1:13:15]</a>. If it takes much back-and-forth, that's a baseline to improve upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:15">[1:13:15]</a>.

### Experiment and Iterate
Approach communication improvement with a hypothesis-driven, experimental mindset, almost like a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:15">[1:13:15]</a>. Observe reactions when framing information differently or trying new tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:15">[1:13:15]</a>. Being fascinated by the topic makes it more enjoyable to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:14:10">[1:14:10]</a>.

### Start Small and Build Habits
Avoid trying to incorporate too many tactics at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:14:40">[1:14:40]</a>. Pick one specific thing, keep it top of mind, and practice it in various settings before moving on to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:14:40">[1:14:40]</a>. Building communication skills is about developing new habits patiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:14:40">[1:14:40]</a>.

### The Compounding Effect of "Minor" Skills
Seemingly minor communication improvements compound over time, making a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:36:19">[1:36:19]</a>. While individual instances might not seem "worth" an extra few minutes, cumulatively, this approach defines the quality of all your work output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:37:00">[1:37:00]</a>. Often, the "big things" are already being done by everyone, so focusing on "boring" or "basic" skills can provide unique leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:37:24">[1:37:24]</a>. People often claim diminishing returns too early, trying something once with mediocre effort and concluding it "doesn't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:38:00">[1:38:00]</a>. Instead, admit when your skill or creativity wasn't enough, then do the hard work to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:38:36">[1:38:36]</a>.

## Recommended First Steps
To begin improving communication skills, focus on two key tactics:
1.  **Most Obvious Objection (MOO):** Before communicating anything, take a few seconds to think about the most obvious objection your audience might have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:58:26">[1:58:26]</a>.
2.  **Framing the Conversation Up Front:** Start by "selling" your audience on the "why" and importance of your message before delving into details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:58:30">[1:58:30]</a>. Use signposting words to aid this framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:58:32">[1:58:32]</a>.

Effective communication is a highly leveraged skill for product leaders, general leaders, and anyone aiming to advance in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. It is considered a core aspect of many leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The challenge in communication often lies in the "illusion that it has taken place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Improving this skill can significantly increase the likelihood of achieving desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## Core Principles of Effective Communication

### Taking Agency and Self-Reflection
When communication leads to confusion, skepticism, or apathy, it's crucial to reflect on one's own contribution to the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Instead of blaming others for not understanding, consider how to explain more clearly, be more compelling, or anticipate questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The best starting point for improvement is reflecting on how one can get better at the skill of communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Practice Like It's Game Day
Many professionals save their best communication practices only for executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. However, limiting practice opportunities means fewer "reps" to genuinely improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Treating every stakeholder as important—including cross-functional team members, managers, and direct reports—provides more consistent practice and ensures that no one's time is wasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Communication as a Means to an End
Communication should be viewed as a tool to achieve an ideal outcome, such as securing buy-in, facilitating good team decisions, or moving projects forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. Its purpose is to serve this end goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

## Key Tactics for Improving Communication

Communication encompasses both verbal (meetings, conversations, presentations) and written (emails, strategy documents, Slack messages) mediums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

### Sales Then Logistics
A common mistake is to overestimate the audience's buy-in and jump straight into logistics (the "how-to" details) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Instead, lead with the "sale"—explaining the "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This means getting people excited and bought into the idea *before* delving into the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Even when an audience has generally bought in, a concise reminder (1-2 minutes or a couple of sentences) of why the topic matters helps frame the conversation and prevents miscommunication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

For executives, who often operate with a "yes, yes, yes, next, next" mindset due to limited time, providing context upfront is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. This brief "selling" helps them understand the relevance and purpose, making them more attentive and receptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

### Conciseness
Conciseness is about the "economy of words" and the "density of the insight," not just a low word count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. A 1,000-word memo can be concise if it's tight, while a 300-word memo can be meandering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

The biggest bottleneck to conciseness is often a lack of clarity in one's own thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. If you don't know your core point, you can't "cut to the chase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. The most consistent solution is **preparation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. Even 30 seconds to a minute of preparation before a meeting can significantly improve focus and conciseness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

For writing, constantly reminding yourself to be concise can lead to trimming 20% or more of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Asking how to reduce cognitive load for the reader also helps to simplify language and structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

It is vital to review your own writing at least once before sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. The "blast radius of a poorly written memo" is much larger than most people think; a confusing message in a Slack channel with 15 people leads to wasted time and back-and-forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. Taking a few extra seconds to ensure clarity can unblock many others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

**Recommended Reading for Writing Concisely**:
*   *On Writing Well* by William Zinsser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>
*   *Stein on Writing* by Sol Stein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>
*   *On Writing* by Stephen King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>
*   *A series of short sentences* (title possibly inferred, focuses on writing short sentences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>

### Signposting
Signposting involves using specific words, phrases, and formatting to guide the reader or listener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. This adds structure and signals what's coming next, especially in longer communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

**Examples of Signposting Words**:
*   "For example" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>
*   "Because" (to share logic/rationale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>
*   "As a next step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>
*   "First, second, third" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>

Signposting can also grab attention verbally, e.g., "The most important part to pay attention to is..." or "The part we were most surprised by is..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

### Formatting
Use formatting like bolding, italics, and underlining sparingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. If too much text is bolded, nothing stands out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

Avoid overusing bullets with sentence fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. Complete sentences in bullets help show the "connective tissue between ideas" and the logical flow, preventing the reader from having to decipher meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. The ability to turn a fragment into a full sentence can also be a litmus test for whether an idea is fully thought out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. This aligns with the Amazon six-page memo philosophy, where writing out ideas in prose forces clarity of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

### Right Level of Confidence
Speak accurately about your level of conviction and the evidence you possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>.
*   **Overconfidence**: Stating hypotheses as facts (e.g., "this is X" instead of "this could X" or "this might X") can lead to pursuing ill-founded initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. It's acceptable for something to be an "initial hunch," but it should be stated as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   **Underconfidence**: Diminishing strong recommendations (e.g., "you can ignore everything I just said") undermines your credibility and can be irresponsible if your advice is truly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.

Have a point of view (POV) and a recommendation, then back it up with evidence, logic, first principles, examples, or data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. Frame initial thoughts with phrases like "my initial thinking is" or "based on what we know, my hunch is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. This allows others to align or push back with specificity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.

Avoid being a "single-minded martyr" who only presents evidence supporting their agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. Understand the broader organizational context and priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>. What might be a "win" for an individual or team might not be the best decision for the company at that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. When pitching something, connect it to the goals of the person you're pitching to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

### Most Obvious Objection (MOO)
MOO stands for **Most Obvious Objection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. Anticipating obvious questions or disagreements before a meeting or presentation helps prevent feeling blindsided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. While not every objection can be anticipated, the obvious ones can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.

Knowing your argument inside and out, including potential counterarguments, prepares you to address concerns proactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. This mental filter encourages structured, forward-thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. This practice also helps crystallize your own thinking, potentially revealing gaps in your plan before you present it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.

### Staying Calm in High-Stakes Conversations
When asked a question you don't know the answer to, don't make something up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. While saying "I'll get back to you" is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>, an experienced communicator can try to understand the "question behind the question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.
*   **Answer in the general direction**: Provide related information you do know (e.g., if asked for last month's mobile user percentage, share last quarter's range) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.
*   **Validate the underlying concern**: Ask "Are you wondering if we are investing in mobile appropriately?" to uncover the deeper reason for their question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.
*   **Reflect back**: If unsure what to say, reflect their question back: "Let me just make sure I understand what you're thinking, what you're looking for..." This buys time, confirms understanding, and allows for clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>.

### Giving Feedback: Strategy Not Self-Expression
When giving feedback, the primary goal should be to **motivate behavior change**, not merely to vent frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. Focus only on the part that will make the person want to change, helping them understand the benefit to themselves and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. This often means trimming 90% of what one initially wants to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.

It's important to process your own frustrations (e.g., by talking to a therapist, partner, or friend) *before* the feedback conversation to ensure you enter it clear and grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

### Delegating Effectively (CEDAF)
The CEDAF framework helps ensure effective delegation while maintaining high standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>:
*   **C - Comprehension**: Provide everything needed for the delegate to understand the task, including logins, context, and the desired end result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.
*   **E - Excitement**: Explain the "why" behind the task to make it as exciting as possible, connecting it to the project's importance or career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>.
*   **D - Derisk**: Anticipate and address obvious risks. For instance, if there's a risk of the person spending too much time in the wrong direction, suggest a smaller, initial deliverable to check alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.
*   **A - Align**: Create opportunities for the delegate to ask questions and confirm their understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. This helps reveal any confusion or forgotten details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>.
*   **F - Feedback**: Establish the shortest possible feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>. Instead of waiting a week, check in after a day, or even brainstorm initial steps within the same conversation to ensure immediate alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>.

Applying CEDAF is an "upfront investment" that saves significant time and effort later by preventing misunderstandings and rework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

## [[managing_up_and_leadership_communication | Managing Up]]

Managing up is an ongoing skill that becomes *more* important as one becomes more senior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>. The more senior you get, the more ambiguity you'll face, and the less likely your manager will provide clearly defined tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

The most leveraged way to manage up is by **sharing your point of view** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>. Instead of asking "What should we do?", offer "Here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. This reduces the manager's cognitive load and demonstrates that you are an active, strategic thinker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. It shows you're not just waiting to be told what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>.

Sharing your POV does not require a perfect answer; it can be an observation, a problem you've noticed, or an initial hypothesis backed by evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>. Junior team members, who often have closer proximity to customers or specific data, can provide valuable insights that managers might otherwise miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.

## Learning and Practice

### Measuring Improvement
To measure communication improvement, observe how quickly and enthusiastically you get the desired reaction from your recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. If it used to take seven touchpoints to get alignment, and now it takes two or three, that indicates progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. Continuously adjust your execution based on what's working and what's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>.

### Experimental Mindset
Approach improving communication with a "hypothesis-driven experimental mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. Treat it like a game: "When I do this, how does that other person react?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.

### Building Habits
Avoid trying to incorporate too many tactics at once, which can lead to overwhelm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. Instead, pick one tactic, keep it top of mind, practice it in various settings, and master it before moving to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. The "minor" improvements in communication compound to create significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

### Swipe File
A "swipe file" is a collection of inspiration that can be referred back to later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>. For communication, this could include well-articulated phrases, strategic statements, or effective written examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. The act of adding to the swipe file trains you to be more alert to effective communication strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>. Regularly reviewing and analyzing these examples helps break down their structure and understand why they were effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>.

## AI's Role in Communication

AI tools like Claude can be valuable thought partners for drafting and refining communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. When using AI for communication, providing specific direction and sharing your point of view significantly improves the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. For example, instead of just asking "what would you say?" about an email, explain the problem and the ideal outcome you're seeking (e.g., "I need to decline respectfully while maintaining our relationship") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>. This provides context for the AI to generate more relevant and effective drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.

AI can also help shorten the feedback loop and align on understanding, similar to the CEDAF framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>. Some AI tools break tasks into smaller chunks and ask clarifying questions to derisk misunderstanding before completing the full request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>.

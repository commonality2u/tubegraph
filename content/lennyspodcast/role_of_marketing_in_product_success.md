When products achieve success, the extent to which marketing was instrumental or decisive is often forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Rory Sutherland emphasizes that good products do not automatically succeed, nor do bad ones necessarily fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:12">[02:22:12]</a>, highlighting the critical, often overlooked, influence of marketing.

## Marketing's Overlooked Importance
Steve Jobs, for instance, was not primarily a technologist but a brilliant pitchman, salesman, and marketer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. His success was largely due to his ability to sell things as a magician, making people believe Apple was capable of magic, thereby reducing skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

Many products, like the iPhone or Ford Model T, are often seen as succeeding purely due to their invention, but significant marketing efforts were required to drive adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. For example, advertising campaigns for electricity ran for 30 years, and it took substantial effort to persuade people to adopt dial-up internet in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Even smallpox vaccination faced huge opposition and skepticism, with Edward Jenner's marketing coup being to get the British royal family to vaccinate their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

### The Impact of Timing and Psychology
Timing is incredibly important; products that failed in the past should not necessarily be rejected if re-evaluated for a different time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:42">[02:30:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Products that were intrinsically good ideas but failed due to timing or marketing include:
*   **Facebook Meta Portal TV**: Despite being a "brilliant" product with great features, it failed due to privacy paranoia surrounding Facebook, as highlighted in negative reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Even during the pandemic, it didn't succeed as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.
*   **Google Glass**: Failed due to marketing missteps, launching too soon, and being given primarily to developers, which created uncool user imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **The Wine Box**: Logically superior (keeps wine fresh for weeks, allows single-glass pours), but did not achieve widespread success due to psychological barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.
*   **The Japanese Toilet**: Offers superior hygiene with water cleaning, but Western society, despite its sophistication, still relies on "medieval" dry paper wiping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.
*   **Early Electric Cars**: Ford and Edison collaborated on an electric car in the early 20th century that was quiet and efficient, but it became stereotyped as a "woman's car," limiting its appeal to male consumers who associated gasoline cars with racing and customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. Current electric vehicles also face user imagery problems, being associated with "smug environmental tossers," which hinders adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
*   **Early Internet Adoption**: Getting people to adopt dial-up internet in the late 1990s was a struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>. Ordering groceries online in the early 2000s was met with laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

> "If you miss if you misjudge some aspect of your launch psychologically you can take something which is intrinsically a brilliant product and it will fail to bite." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>

## The Power of Distinctiveness and Fame

### Being Memorable
A key aspect of effective marketing is to be memorable and distinctive. Rory Sutherland suggests:
> "If you can imagine a stand-up comedian doing a routine about your product then you're on to something." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>
This highlights the value of slightly odd things or "idiosyncrasies" that count double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Examples include:
*   Rolls-Royces having a pedal on the floor for headlamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   Jaguar's overhead light switch on the central console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   Veuve Clicquot champagne accidentally ending up with yellow labels, which became its defining visual identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   MCI's "friends and family" phone plan, which, though seemingly irrational, garnered significant public interest due to its unique friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

The concept of "maximally advanced yet acceptable" (MAYA) suggests a pace of change that consumers will accept, generally preferring evolution over complete reinvention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Products can be "just the right amount of weird" to be interesting without being alienating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

### The Value of Fame
For early-stage founders building their brand, the advice is simple: be consistent, be distinctive, and be famous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>.
Fame fundamentally changes the rules of business in nonlinear ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. When a company is not famous, it has to find all its customers. Once it reaches a "magical sort of escape velocity of fame," people start coming to it, offering new applications or ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.

The value of fame is impossible to quantify, as it affects everything:
*   People will return calls from a famous company's CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.
*   Employees may work for less money and apply directly to a famous company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
*   Customers give famous brands the benefit of the doubt and tolerate occasional missteps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.
*   A great brand allows a company to "play the game of capitalism on easy mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>.

Brand building is a compounding effect, much like a pension, where early investments yield seemingly small returns but grow significantly over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>. Attempts to evaluate advertising on short-term transactional metrics will "grotesquely undervalue" its contribution to ultimate business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>.

## Thinking Psychologically in [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | Product]] Design
Businesses often try to run based on reductionist, logical models from maths, physics, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. However, human psychology is a branch of complexity theory, where small things can have huge, nonlinear effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. The opposite of a good idea can sometimes be another good idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>. For example, hotel check-in can be either high-touch or no-touch; both are distinct and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>.

The urge to appear serious can be a disaster in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Logical thinking often assumes a single right answer and complete information, which is rarely the case in real-life business decisions involving human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>. Humans have evolved to make decisions under uncertainty, relying on habits and social copying (doing what others do) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:15">[01:31:15]</a>.

### Designing for Humanity
Companies that design for human instincts rather than rigid organograms foster greater innovation and motivation:
*   **Octopus Energy**: Employs small, autonomous teams with a clear company objective but considerable autonomy in how they achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:12">[02:22:12]</a>.
*   **Shopify**: Customer service teams are in groups of 10, modeled on sports teams. This structure, though less "lean," leads to highly motivated and happy employees who feel strong obligations to their teammates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **AO Appliances Online**: Staff are given simple, human-centric briefs like "treat the customer like you treat your grandmother" or "make your mom proud," which define customer service in a way that allows for judgment and autonomy, unlike strict metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Zappos**: Famously refused to make call speed a metric, allowing calls to be as long as needed to solve a problem. This demonstrates a focus on customer satisfaction over arbitrary metrics, empowering employees and fostering trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:21">[02:07:21]</a>.

> "The loss of autonomy and judgment...is deeply depressing, it's deeply demotivating." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:03">[02:17:03]</a>

### Less is More
In [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product design]], less can often be more. The Sony Walkman, for example, was intentionally designed *without* recording functionality initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. Despite engineers advocating for adding it at minimal cost, the instigator, Akio Morita, insisted on a single, clear function: high-quality personal music listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:59">[01:06:59]</a>. This avoided ambiguity and focused user perception. Similarly, McDonald's succeeded by reducing choice, while traditional American diners offered extensive customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.

## Integrating Marketing and Innovation
Marketing and innovation are two sides of the same coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>. Businesses tend to follow a linear process, but innovation is not linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. The ideal approach combines psychological, technological, and economic considerations in parallel, rather than in sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.

One must either:
1.  Work out what people want and find a clever way to make it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>.
2.  Work out what can be made and find a clever way to make people want it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>.

The greatest success comes from doing both simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:24">[01:23:24]</a>.

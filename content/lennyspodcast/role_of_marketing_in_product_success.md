When products succeed, the extent to which marketing was instrumental or decisive in their success is often forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. People tend to attribute success to the product's intrinsic quality, overlooking the crucial role marketing played in shaping that perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This phenomenon, known as survivorship bias, means that failed, yet intrinsically good, products are often ignored in the analysis of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.

## Marketing Beyond Advertising

Marketing encompasses more than just advertising or communication; it includes strategic positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. Rory Sutherland highlights that [[The role of product teams in the sales process | Steve Jobs]], for instance, was not primarily a technologist but a brilliant pitchman, salesman, and marketer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His genius lay in product design, focusing on a limited number of offerings, extraordinary taste, and his ability to present products in a way that made Apple seem capable of magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.

## The Power of Distinctiveness and Fame

One key aspect of effective marketing is cultivating distinctiveness. If a product can be the subject of a stand-up comedian's routine, it likely has something unique worth preserving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Slightly odd or idiosyncratic features can be a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Examples include:

*   **Rolls-Royces** retaining a floor pedal for headlamp dipping, a unique feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Jaguar's** counter-intuitive light switch placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Veuve Clicquot's** famous yellow label, which originated from a mistake but became a defining visual identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **MCI's "Friends and Family"** phone plan, which, despite being somewhat irrational, garnered significant interest due to its quirky nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Achieving Fame

For [[Product market fit strategies | early-stage founders]] looking to build their brand, the advice is simple: be consistent, be distinctive, and be famous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>. Fame fundamentally changes the rules of business in nonlinear ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>:
*   **Customer Acquisition**: When not famous, businesses must actively seek out customers. Reaching an "escape velocity of fame" means customers start coming to you, often suggesting new applications for your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.
*   **Trust and Reputation**: A famous company or brand carries a level of trust and reassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. People are more comfortable engaging with something they've heard of before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>. This allows them to "play the game of capitalism on easy mode," where customers and partners are more forgiving and inclined to give the benefit of the doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>.

## The Psychological Dimension of Product Success

Products don't automatically succeed simply because they are "good," nor do "bad" ones necessarily fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>. [[The importance and stages of product-market fit | Timing]] is also crucial, and products that failed in the past might succeed at a different time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Examples of Products That Failed Due to Perception or Timing:

*   **Facebook Meta TV Portal**: Despite being a brilliant product with advanced features at a low price, it failed largely due to public "privacy paranoia" related to Facebook's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Google Glass**: Its launch was mistimed, and the initial user base of developers, rather than "cool people," created negative user imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
*   **Wine Box**: Logically superior for preservation and convenience, it did not achieve widespread adoption, possibly due to perception issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.
*   **Japanese Toilet**: Despite being hygienically superior, Western cultures have resisted adoption, clinging to "medieval" dry wiping practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>.
*   **Early Electric Cars**: Initially popular with women due to their quietness and ease of use, they became stereotyped as "women's cars," hindering broader adoption among men who preferred gasoline cars for racing and customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.
*   **Electric Cars Today**: Despite technological advancements, their adoption is sometimes hindered by "user imagery" where owners are perceived as "smug environmental tossers," despite many buyers being interested in technology and performance, not just environmental benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
*   **Sony Walkman**: Engineers wanted to add recording functionality, but the visionary behind the Walkman, Akio Morita, insisted on a single, clear function (listening to high-quality music) to avoid ambiguity and provide a clear "affordance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

### The Role of Human Psychology
Human behavior is influenced by habits ("do what I've done before") and social copying ("do what everybody else seems to be doing") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:47">[03:50:47]</a>. This explains why people might be more inclined to adopt a new technology like heat pumps if their neighbors have them, rather than based purely on financial or environmental logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:09">[03:07:09]</a>. This "irrational" behavior is actually a highly rational strategy at a meta-level, reducing risk and learning from collective experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

Companies often fail to account for the psychological aspect because they attempt to run their business based on reductionist, linear, and logical models, similar to high school math problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>. However, real-life decisions, especially those involving human behavior, are complex, nonlinear, and involve imperfect information and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:51">[03:00:51]</a>.

## Integrating Psychology into Product Development

[[Becoming a successful product manager | Successful product management]] involves thinking psychologically, not just logically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This means understanding that:
*   **The Opposite of a Good Idea Can Be Another Good Idea**: There can be multiple "right" answers or approaches. For example, hotel check-in can be "insanely high touch" or "no touch" â€“ both are valid if distinctive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Less Can Be More**: Sometimes, reducing functionality, as seen with the Walkman, can simplify a product's purpose and make it more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.
*   **Trust and Autonomy over Rigid Metrics**: Companies like Octopus Energy, Shopify, and Zappos demonstrate success by empowering small, autonomous teams with clear objectives and allowing them to exercise judgment, rather than strictly adhering to metrics that can be gamed or demotivating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Zappos famously did not measure call speed in their call center, prioritizing solving the customer's problem, no matter how long it took <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:21">[02:37:21]</a>. This human-centric approach stands in contrast to a "Soviet-style capitalism" driven by short-term targets and constant cost-cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:23">[02:28:23]</a>.

## The Sweet Spot of Innovation

The ideal scenario for product success lies in the intersection of psychology, technology, and economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Businesses should strive to combine these elements in parallel, rather than in a linear process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This means:
*   **Working in Parallel**: Integrate marketing and innovation from the outset, rather than leaving marketing until the product is fully developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding Human Desire**: Either figure out what people want and how to make it, or figure out what can be made and find a clever way to make people want it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. The greatest success comes from doing both simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

By acknowledging the nonlinear, psychological, and often unpredictable nature of human behavior, businesses can develop more effective strategies for bringing innovative products to market and achieving long-term success.

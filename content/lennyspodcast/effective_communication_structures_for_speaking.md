Effective communication structures are crucial for enhancing clarity and influence in both planned and spontaneous speaking situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. These structures provide a logical framework that helps speakers organize their thoughts and ensure their message is digestible and memorable for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

## Preparing for Spontaneous Speaking

Most public speaking instances occur spontaneously, rather than through prepared talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This includes situations like Q&A sessions, giving toasts, providing feedback, or engaging in small talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. A key principle is that one must "prepare to be spontaneous," which, though counterintuitive, is essential for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Just as athletes or jazz musicians prepare and practice to perform spontaneously, speakers can do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

The process of [[improving_communication_skills | improving communication skills]] involves addressing both mindset and the approach to messaging, particularly through structure and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

### Why Structure Matters

When speaking spontaneously, people often "spew out" information, listing items without a logical connection, which makes it difficult for the audience to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Human brains are wired for story and logical connections, not just lists of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. A structure provides a clear beginning, middle, and end, acting as a "recipe" that guides *how* to say something, allowing the speaker to focus on *what* to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

## Key Communication Structures

Several [[frameworks_for_clarity_and_influence | frameworks for clarity and influence]] can be used in different spontaneous speaking scenarios:

### 1. Problem-Solution-Benefit
This structure is commonly used in advertising and is a logical beginning, middle, and end for presenting ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Problem:** Identify a problem in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Explain how to solve it with a product, service, or idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Benefit:** Describe how the audience or user benefits from the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

### 2. PREP (Point, Reason, Example, Point)
PREP is effective for making a single, clear point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **Point:** State your main point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **Reason:** Provide a reason for your point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **Example:** Give an example to illustrate your point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Point:** Restate or summarize your main point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

### 3. What-So What-Now What
This three-question structure is highly beneficial for product teams, updates, or broader presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **What:** Describe your product, service, offering, update, or feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **So What:** Explain why this is important and relevant to the audience, company, or clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Now What:** Detail what comes next or what actions will be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

### 4. Four I's (for Giving Feedback)
The Four I's structure helps package feedback to make it easier for the recipient to digest and for the giver to formulate thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   **Information:** Set the context for the feedback, describing the specific behavior or situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. (e.g., "This is the third time you've shown up late to this meeting.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>
*   **Impact:** Explain the impact the behavior had on you, the feedback giver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. (e.g., "I feel you're not prioritizing this meeting the same way others are.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>
*   **Invitation:** Invite collaboration to solve the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. (e.g., "What can we do to help make sure you show up prepared for the next meeting?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>
*   **Implications:** Discuss the positive consequences of addressing the behavior or the negative consequences of not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. (e.g., "Because if you do, we're going to finish the project on time and get a new cool project.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>

### 5. WHAT (for Toasts and Tributes)
This acronym helps in [[crafting_compelling_presentations | crafting compelling presentations]] for celebratory events or work tributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Toasts should be brief, and emotion should be conveyed through anecdotes rather than simply stating feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **Why are we here?** Briefly state the purpose of the gathering or event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **How are you connected?** Establish your relationship to the event or person being honored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.
*   **Anecdote:** Share a relevant and accessible story or quick example <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. Ensure it's concise and offers insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.
*   **Thank you / Gratitude:** Express thanks or gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

### 6. ADD (for Q&A)
This structure helps provide clear and concise answers during question and answer sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Answer:** Directly and concisely answer the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Detailed Example:** Provide a tangible example to reinforce the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   **Describe Relevance:** Explain the significance or relevance of the answer to the audience, connecting the dots for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

### 7. AAA (for Apologies)
This structure provides a framework for effective apologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Acknowledge:** Clearly state the specific behavior or transgression you are apologizing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Avoid saying "I'm sorry that you feel bad," which shifts responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Appreciate:** Express understanding or appreciation for the difficulty or negative impact caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Amend:** Detail a specific action you will take to remedy the situation or prevent it from happening again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Practice and Improvement

To effectively use these communication structures, consistent practice is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Repetition:** Regularly apply these structures in different communication scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. For example, after listening to a podcast or reading an article, take a moment to apply the "What-So What-Now What" structure to summarize and internalize the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Reflection:** Think about what worked well and what didn't in your communication attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Feedback:** Seek feedback from others, as individuals are not always the best judges of their own communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

Organizations like Toastmasters provide platforms for [[improving_public_speaking_through_interactive_exercises | improving public speaking through interactive exercises]] and getting "reps" in spontaneous speaking, including "table topics" where members speak extemporaneously for about 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Improv classes can also help individuals become more comfortable, present, and collaborative in their communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. Additionally, many universities offer continuing studies or extension classes on communication skills that are open to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

> "The only way you get better at communication spontaneous or planned is the way you get better at anything repetition, reflection, and feedback." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>

By focusing on these structures and consistently practicing, individuals can significantly [[improving_communication_skills | improve their communication skills]], becoming more confident and effective speakers in any situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

Founders often make significant mistakes when building sales teams in B2B (business-to-business) environments. The core issue is a fundamental misunderstanding of what B2B sales entails. Instead of selling commodities or used cars, B2B sales is about [[Crafting Effective Sales Pitches | solving problems]] for customers [00:00:03] [00:00:06]. A common error is viewing sales as "icky" or transactional, rather than a process of understanding customer needs and offering tailored solutions [00:09:02].

## Fundamental Misconceptions about Sales

Many founders and sales representatives make the mistake of not truly understanding B2B sales. In SaaS (Software as a Service), the job is not to sell a "used car" but rather a sophisticated solution like a "Tesla Model 3 Performance" [00:00:09]. This means being an expert, answering all questions, and guiding the customer to see how the product uniquely solves their specific problems, even acknowledging when it's not the right fit [00:37:53] [00:38:00] [00:38:31] [00:38:44]. Selling a commodity is not the aim [00:00:43].

## When to Start Hiring Salespeople

A significant mistake is delaying or avoiding sales hires when the business fundamentally requires a sales motion.
Founders must be honest about their go-to-market strategy [00:07:10]. If customers require effort to deploy, have questions about security or competition, or need onboarding, a self-serve PLG (Product-Led Growth) model will likely fail if forced [00:07:21] [00:07:31].

A company that went from $5 million to under $1 million in revenue because the founders "fired the whole sales team" due to disliking sales is a stark example of this [[Common reasons startups fail and how to avoid them | common reason startups fail]] [00:08:14] [00:08:26].

Founders often need to be the first "head of sales" [00:25:26]. The time to consider hiring the first salesperson is when:
*   The founder has personally closed the first 10-15-20 "unaffiliated customers" [00:07:10] [00:11:39].
*   More than 20% of the founder's time is booked with sales-related activities, indicating a need for leverage [00:14:31] [00:24:51].
*   A repeatable sales process has been established, even if it's "crummy" [00:25:00] [00:25:06] [00:25:26].

## Hiring the First Salespeople

Founders frequently make mistakes in selecting their initial sales hires.

### Hiring Only One Salesperson
It's crucial to hire two salespeople, not just one, to allow for A/B testing of humans and approaches [00:14:58] [00:15:00].

### The "Would You Buy From Them?" Test
The single most important rule for the first two sales reps is to hire people from whom the founder would personally buy their own product [00:15:18] [00:18:18]. This means looking for "quirky pirates and Romantics" who are genuinely passionate about the product, rather than relying solely on impressive company logos on their resume (e.g., Twilio or Cloudflare) [00:16:06] [00:16:20] [00:18:50].

These early reps should have a few years of B2B sales experience and sufficient maturity to be trusted with precious early leads and customers [00:26:15] [00:26:36] [00:26:39].

### Avoiding the VP of Sales Too Early
Hiring a VP of Sales before having at least two sales reps consistently hitting quota and closing deals is "a 100% chance of failure" [00:19:27] [00:20:49]. A VP of Sales' job is typically to scale a proven model (e.g., from 3 to 300 reps), not to find product-market fit or be the first rep [00:19:37] [00:21:02].

Early sales teams, including the first VP of Sales, must be "product gurus" and experts, intimately understanding the product's 10x features and how to navigate around feature gaps [00:20:31] [00:21:34] [00:22:07]. Many VPs hired too early are not product savants and fail to understand the nuances of the product [00:22:13] [00:24:22].

A common mistake today is hiring a VP of Sales who doesn't want to actively "do sales" or be involved in deals [00:27:32] [00:27:35]. A good VP of Sales should be in deals 20-30 hours a week when they start [00:23:44] [00:27:08]. Interviewing a VP of Sales who prioritizes "process, process, process" or Salesforce implementation in their first month over meeting customers is a red flag [00:31:39] [00:31:41] [00:31:43].

Founders should also be wary of hiring sales veterans who are burnt out or cynical [00:33:09] [00:33:17]. Look for a "stretch VP of Sales" – someone who was a director or senior director previously and sees the role as career growth, willing to put in the work [01:02:29] [01:02:44].

### Interviewing Tips
*   **The "Sell Me This App" Test**: Require candidates, especially the early hires, to sell your product to you [00:35:48] [00:36:00]. Give them time to prepare. Shockingly, many candidates don't even watch explainer videos or read company homepages before interviews [00:36:26] [00:36:30] [00:36:50].
*   **"What do you want to do your first 14 days?"**: For both sales and product leadership roles, if the candidate doesn't mention meeting customers, "don't hire them" [00:30:34] [00:30:40] [00:44:40] [00:44:48].
*   **Reference Checks**: Many companies stopped doing reference checks after 2020, which is a major mistake [00:41:08] [00:41:13]. Your leads are too precious to entrust to someone without vetting [00:18:24].
*   **Product Difficulty**: A powerful heuristic is to hire someone whose last product was *harder* to sell than yours [00:55:06]. This often means a more technical product, a more competitive space (like the number four player), or a more complicated business process [00:57:04] [00:57:06] [00:57:24] [00:57:29].

## Comp and Quota Mistakes
Founders often mismanage sales compensation and quotas.

*   **Over-worrying about On-Target Earnings (OTE)**: Don't panic over a sales rep's OTE (e.g., $150k) [00:47:33]. Understand the base vs. bonus split (often 50/50), meaning the upfront cash commitment is less [00:47:07]. The key is the return: a rep should ultimately bring in 3-5x what they take home [00:47:50] [00:48:04].
*   **Unrealistic Initial Expectations**: In the very early days, the goal is for a rep to close more than their take-home pay [00:49:12]. For the first quarter, consider a "ramp" where they keep 100% of what they close to build momentum and allow them to "put points on the board" and "eat" [00:46:09] [00:49:01] [00:50:06].
*   **Frequent Comp Plan Changes**: If a compensation plan is well-designed, it shouldn't need constant tweaking [00:50:31]. Constant changes signal a "leaky boat" and demoralize the sales team [00:50:57] [00:51:02].
*   **Not Wanting Reps to Make Money**: Founders sometimes resent when sales reps make more than they do, especially in early stages [00:52:17]. This is a mistake; if the sales rep is earning a lot, it means they are bringing in significant revenue, which is a "win-win" for the company and its equity value [00:49:25] [00:52:27] [00:52:30].

## Scaling the Sales Team

When scaling, common mistakes involve organizational structure and management.

*   **Rules of Eight**: Sales organizations typically follow "rules of eight" for management ratios: eight SDRs (Sales Development Representatives) to one manager, eight AEs (Account Executives) to one director, and so on [01:00:06] [01:00:42].
    *   **SDRs (Sales Development Representatives)**: Generally entry-level positions, often fresh out of school, focused on email and phone outreach to generate leads and screen inbound leads for AEs. Compensated around $60k-$80k OTE [01:05:48] [01:05:57].
    *   **AEs (Account Executives)**: More seasoned professionals who close deals. Compensation ranges widely from $90k-$200k OTE, split 50/50 base/bonus [01:06:15] [01:06:36].
*   **Expecting Full-Stack AEs**: A common mistake is expecting AEs to be "full-stacked" – doing their own outbound prospecting, lead management, and closing [01:07:12]. Most AEs prefer to be closers and want leads handed to them [01:07:48].
*   **Not Hiring Managers Under a Stretch VP**: A stretch VP of Sales will struggle and "drown" if they cannot effectively hire and manage directors under them [01:03:12] [01:03:25]. Aim to promote 50% from within and hire 50% externally for managerial roles [01:03:37].

## Product and Sales Alignment

Misalignment between product and sales teams is a frequent source of organizational friction.

*   **Product Not Deeply Involved in Sales**: Product leaders, especially the Head or VP of Product, should be deeply involved in sales, particularly for large deals [01:10:28] [01:10:30]. Their product fluency and ability to make commitments or suggest workarounds can be the difference between closing or losing a deal [01:11:04] [01:11:15].
*   **Unstructured Feature Requests from Sales**: Sales teams often make urgent feature requests that change constantly, driven by immediate deal needs [01:14:01]. This "tails wagging the dog" approach burns out the product organization [01:14:26] [01:14:31].
    *   **Solution**: Product should give the Head of Sales a set "budget" (e.g., story points or 10% of the pie chart) each quarter for feature requests [01:14:46] [01:15:09]. This forces the sales leadership to prioritize and load-balance requests across their team and the year [01:14:56] [01:15:48] [01:19:01] [[Common challenges and solutions in aligning company teams on positioning | Common challenges and solutions in aligning company teams on positioning]].
    *   Weekly meetings between the VP of Sales and VP of Product, where these budgets and priorities are discussed objectively, are crucial [01:16:05] [01:19:03].
*   **Junior Reps Dictating Roadmap**: Individual contributor (IC) sales reps should not be dictating roadmap decisions [01:17:36] [01:17:51]. They should surface ideas to their managers, who then engage with product leadership [01:17:53] [01:18:33] [01:18:39].

## Broader Business Mistakes Influencing Sales

### Weaponizing Teams with Revenue Goals
While everyone should be aligned on revenue goals, directly tying average product managers or customer success teams to strict revenue metrics (like financial bonuses or OKRs) can lead to "dark patterns" or "customer hostile" actions, ultimately damaging customer relationships and preventing long-term compounding revenue [01:21:20] [01:21:40] [01:22:09] [01:25:00] [01:26:11] [01:26:25].

### Forcing Annual Contracts
Forcing customers, especially SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses), into annual contracts when they prefer monthly payments is a mistake, even if it looks good on a spreadsheet [01:32:51] [01:33:00]. Product teams should be the "voice of the customer" and advocate for flexible payment options [01:33:28] [01:33:35].

### Not Focusing on Churn
For product-led growth (PLG) companies or those with self-service models, high churn (e.g., 3-4% monthly for SMBs) is almost "unsolvable" and a major mistake [01:26:39] [01:26:41] [01:26:54] [01:26:57]. Relentlessly bringing down churn should be a primary focus to ensure revenue compounds over time [01:27:02] [01:27:05].

### Over-Monetizing Free Users and Trials
Founders often cut free trials or hide free editions under pressure, mistakenly believing it will boost revenue [01:32:42] [01:34:49]. This is a "short-term" strategy that can "anti-compound" revenue by damaging relationships with the long tail of free users who serve as advocates [01:26:26] [01:26:29] [01:36:31] [01:37:07].

Products are generally better when they offer a free edition because it forces developers to invest in user experience and onboarding, benefiting all customers, including enterprises [01:37:47] [01:38:09] [01:38:22]. Founders need to designate a "VP of Free" (often the founder or head of product) to champion the value and nurturing of the free user base [01:32:16] [01:32:34] [01:36:15] [01:36:17] [01:39:21] [[Structuring a growth team | Structuring a growth team]]. Sales and marketing teams cannot be expected to care about free users unless they can be immediately monetized [01:36:19] [01:36:23].

### Not Doing Customer Events
Founders should actively organize events, even small steak dinners or meetups, for their customers and prospects [01:52:25] [01:52:28]. Customers will sell prospects for you, leading to more sales [01:52:48]. While large conferences are extremely expensive and often unprofitable for tech companies [01:55:20] [01:55:30] [01:57:40], smaller, localized gatherings are highly valuable [01:52:53] [01:53:03] [01:53:30].

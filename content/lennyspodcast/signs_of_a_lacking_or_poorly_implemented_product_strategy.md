Many organizations believe their primary issues stem from a lack of staff training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, 99% of the time, the root cause lies in how they set their goals and [[creating_a_winning_product_strategy | deploy their strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Without a clear strategy, trained employees lack the necessary context for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Melissa Perri, a seasoned product expert, identifies several common problems and [[challenges_and_strategies_in_product_management | challenges]] related to strategy implementation that often arise in companies, particularly those scaling rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Common Problems and Missing Strategy Cues

One of the most prevalent issues for Software as a Service (SaaS) companies is navigating the pivotal scale-up phase after achieving [[signs_of_being_stuck_at_a_productmarket_fit_stage_and_how_to_pivot | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This transition often requires rethinking and reprioritizing their entire strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Key signs that a company's strategy is lacking or poorly implemented include:

*   **Absence of a Chief Product Officer (CPO)**
    *   Founders or junior product leaders, who excel at execution and rapid experimentation during early growth, may struggle with the comprehensive product strategy needed for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
    *   When executives and the board express uncertainty about the activities within tech or product departments, or whether goals are being met, it's a strong indicator that the product leadership is not at the Chief Product Officer level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   A critical junction for hiring a CPO often occurs when Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) surpasses $10 million, typically around $20-30 million, especially in high-growth companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
    *   Other indicators include expanding into a more complex multi-product portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, geographic expansion, entering drastically new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, major transformations or pivots, or significant company mergers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
    *   A lack of a CPO is also apparent when product managers are frustrated by insufficient direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, when hiring product managers becomes difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, or when there's no clear training path or process for junior product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

*   **Misconceptions about Solutions vs. Strategy**
    *   Many organizations incorrectly assume their problems are due to insufficient training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, training without strategic context is ineffective, as people lack direction on what to work towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
    *   The "missing middle" often exists, where teams know what they're working on (features, enhancements, bug fixes), but executives fail to see how these efforts contribute to business value or align with the overall company vision and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
    *   A common symptom is teams working excessively long hours (80 hours a week) on releases without corresponding movement in key metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This leads executives to view product and tech as a "black box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

*   **Undefined or Uncommunicated Strategy**
    *   Strategy often exists only in leaders' heads, not explicitly written down or clearly communicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
    *   Different departments or even executives may have conflicting ideas about the company's vision and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. For example, a "vision" like "be the backbone of healthcare" is a tagline, not a concrete vision unless it defines what the company will be doing and not doing, and how it will be different in 5-10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
    *   When product teams are constantly asking "why are we building this?", it indicates a failure in leadership to clearly explain the strategic purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
    *   Lack of a clear, prioritized strategy often results in teams being spread too thin across numerous initiatives, preventing significant movement in business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

*   **Lack of Organizational Alignment**
    *   Significant infighting and disagreements among stakeholders and executives often stem from a lack of alignment on common company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. For example, sales teams focusing solely on "net new logos" without clear prioritization against product roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
    *   When strategy is deployed correctly, all executives are on the same page, allowing for calm, objective trade-off discussions rather than emotional conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. This alignment also makes it easier for product teams to push back on requests that don't align with overall priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

## Building a Robust Strategy

To address these issues, Melissa Perri suggests:

*   **Asking the Right Questions**: Interrogate leaders about what "good" looks like, their vision, and how specific product efforts will impact business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **Formalizing Strategy**: Encourage executives to write a two-pager outlining the company's vision, market positioning, current product state, priorities (strategic intents), and desired outcomes. These should be prioritized, indicating what the company will and will not do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
*   **Connecting Levels**: Ensure a clear connection, or "missing middle," between high-level strategic intents, problem-oriented product initiatives (driven by directors/VPs of product), and the tactical solutions (epics/options) built by product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.
*   **Holistic Communication**: Document strategies in shared platforms like Google Docs or wikis, linking them to allow anyone to trace a tactical effort back to the overall company strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.
*   **Concreteness in Vision**: A vision should be concrete enough for people to visualize it, be lofty and forward-looking, differentiate the company from competitors, and explicitly state what the company will *not* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. Visual aids from UX designers can enhance vision communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

### Product Operations (ProductOps)
The emerging role of Product Operations addresses the scalability challenges in product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. ProductOps aims to:

*   **Standardize Processes**: Ensure consistency in roadmaps, career ladders, meeting structures, and other inter-departmental processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   **Improve Data Access**: Help surface internal data from financial systems and user analytics to inform strategy and track Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. Leaders often lack data to set strategy and should hire data analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>.
*   **Streamline Customer and Market Research**: Standardize approaches to external data, market research, and customer interviews to inform strategy and prevent customer fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

### Developing Strategic Thinking
To get better at [[creating_a_winning_product_strategy | product strategy]]:

*   **Practice "As If" Thinking**: Even without the formal role, imagine what you would do if you were the CPO. This provides valuable practice and exposure to strategic questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.
*   **Talk to Key Stakeholders**: Engage with CPOs, financial experts, and other departments like sales to understand market dynamics, financials, and win-loss analyses. This exposes product managers to broader business contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.
*   **Leverage Data and Research**: Utilize internal and external data, customer research, and company goals to ask critical questions about how to achieve the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.
*   **Embrace Iteration and Adaptability**: Be willing to make informed decisions based on available data, even if not 100% certain. Continuously reevaluate strategy and pivot if necessary, rather than rigidly sticking to ineffective processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

By proactively addressing these signs and adopting a holistic, data-driven approach to [[effective_product_management_strategies | strategy development and deployment]], organizations can significantly improve their product outcomes and overall business success.

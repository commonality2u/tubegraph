Stripe has integrated [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI]] and machine learning (ML) deeply into its operations and product offerings, leveraging these technologies to enhance reliability, improve user experience, and drive internal efficiency.

## Historical Use of Machine Learning
Stripe has utilized advanced machine learning techniques at the core of its products since its early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>. For instance, **Radar**, Stripe's solution for payment fraud, has incorporated machine learning since its introduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. These techniques are essential for catching bad actors, such as fraudsters and fraudulent businesses; the company "couldn't operate without them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.

More than a year prior to the interview, Stripe integrated Transformer technology—a new technology based on a Google paper from four to five years prior—into these systems, which profoundly impacted their ability to solve problems for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

## Impact of AI on Startups and Business Practices
Stripe actively supports [[impact_of_ai_on_startups_and_business_practices | AI startups]], many of which run on Stripe's platform for monetization. These startups often have significant compute resource costs, making it crucial for them to have a monetization model from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. Stripe helps these companies, including OpenAI for ChatGPT Plus, manage their subscriptions, revenue tracking, and financial operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. This enables AI startups to focus their valuable engineering resources on innovation within their core business rather than on complex financial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Data Team Efficiency and Product Enhancement
Stripe is also enthusiastic about applying [[leveraging_ai_for_data_team_efficiency | AI techniques]] (specifically Large Language Models or LLMs) to improve its own ability to serve users and enhance internal efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

Key applications include:
*   **Enhanced Documentation**: Using GPT-4, Stripe has processed its extensive documentation, storing it as embeddings to answer developer questions directly within the documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>. This aims to reduce the time developers spend reading and synthesizing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>.
*   **Sigma (SQL Query Generation)**: Sigma, Stripe's product for writing SQL queries across user data, is being enhanced with LLMs. Users can ask questions in natural language, and the system will generate the appropriate SQL query, making it more accessible to non-developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
*   **Internal Efficiency**: AI is applied internally to answer user questions faster and facilitate quicker internal assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>. To manage sensitive data, Stripe built an internal UI and integration to GPT-4, providing presets for various tasks like drafting blog posts with a specific tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>. This allows non-engineers (e.g., marketing, user support) to leverage AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.

## Influence of AI on Engineering Productivity
Stripe has made GitHub Copilot available to its engineers after a rigorous trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>. The company found Copilot to be very effective, not only in [[influence_of_ai_on_engineering_productivity | improving productivity]] but also in allowing engineers to focus their energy on larger architectural problems rather than micro-level tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>.

One significant acceleration seen with Copilot is in generating test cases, especially for boilerplate code. This enables engineers to concentrate on the critical aspects of testing, potentially leading to higher code quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>.

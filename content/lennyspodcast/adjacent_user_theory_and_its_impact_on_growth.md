The "adjacent user theory" is a framework that helps product teams understand and drive growth by focusing on potential users just outside their current user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. This concept was developed during a period of hypergrowth at Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.

## Core Concept
Adjacent user theory posits that while it's crucial to understand current users and their motivations, sustainable growth comes from identifying and catering to the "next user" â€“ someone who could be using the product but currently isn't, due to some unmet need or barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>.

At Instagram, this theory emerged from the rapid user growth where the user base fundamentally changed over short periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. For example, women in their 30s in the US who initially found no reason to use Instagram because they had Facebook accounts, became avid users a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. When growth rates are high (e.g., 30-50% or more annually), it's essential to continually identify who the next user is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>.

## Application and Impact on Growth
Applying the adjacent user theory involves several key steps:

### 1. "Dogfooding" in the Adjacent User State
Product teams should actively use their own products, but from the perspective of an adjacent user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>. A power user's experience of a product (e.g., Gmail, YouTube) is often significantly better due to accumulated history and personalized data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>. Using the product as a new user, or a user with different needs, can reveal obvious missed opportunities and highlight why existing "flywheels" might not be working for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.

For example, when a new user joins YouTube, their search history is sparse, leading to less personalized and potentially worse recommendations compared to a long-time user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.

### 2. Deep User Understanding and Research
It's critical to understand the persona of the adjacent user, their motivations, and why the product currently doesn't work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>. This often involves:
*   **Observing data**: Look for trends like declining cohort curves, which might indicate that newer user cohorts are struggling to find value or retain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>. For instance, Instagram saw registration conversion rates drop significantly (e.g., 15%) not because of a product bug, but because new users from different markets (e.g., India, Philippines) had different understandings of how the product should work, different phones, or less tech savviness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>.
*   **Direct engagement**: Teams should talk to, watch, and even visit adjacent users to see firsthand how they use the product and what pain points exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>. This ties directly into the concept of [[Understanding and analyzing user behavior | understand work]].

### 3. Reflecting Real-Life Needs (Jobs to Be Done)
The theory emphasizes aligning the product with the "jobs to be done" in users' daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.

At Instacart, the initial user might have been an office admin, but the adjacent user could be a parent of multiple children at home, or later, a single person seeking convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>. Their needs and how they interact with the product change significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

A major discovery at Instacart was the difficulty of reordering items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. Despite 90% of a user's order being the same after five trips, reordering was cumbersome, requiring many clicks and forcing users to reorder the entire previous basket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>. By making reordering easier, Instacart significantly improved retention, proving that understanding the real-world job (making dinner, restocking staples) was critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.

## Strategic Implications
*   **Prioritizing Product Features**: Understanding adjacent users helps identify what functionality and abilities are fundamentally different for new cohorts and where to focus development efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.
*   **Balancing Product Focus**: It informs the balance between optimizing for current power users and expanding the product's appeal to new segments.
*   **Compounding Growth Loops**: Focusing on adjacent users can help build new [[Developing a growth model for a business | compounding growth loops]], moving beyond single acquisition channels to two, three, or four methods that layer onto each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.
*   **Re-evaluating "Obvious" Features**: For Instagram, an initial assumption was that all "follows" were equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. However, early users were following many celebrities, leading to a "sinkhole chamber" where their first posts received no engagement from friends, causing them to churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>. A "connections pivot" was made to prioritize connecting new users with real human connections first, rather than celebrities, which dramatically improved retention and doubled it over 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.
*   **Uncovering New Opportunities**: Solving initial problems for adjacent users can reveal entirely new opportunities. For instance, fixing account access issues at Instagram (e.g., combining login fields, saving credentials) led to a significant increase in content creation, particularly from second and third accounts. This insight prompted the creation of a dedicated "multiple accounts" team, making it seamless for users to navigate between personal, business, or fan accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:34">[01:23:34]</a>.

Adjacent user theory is mandatory for hypergrowth companies but also very helpful for products struggling to grow, by helping capture more market share rather than just increasing engagement from existing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>.

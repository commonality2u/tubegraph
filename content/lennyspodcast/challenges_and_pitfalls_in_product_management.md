Vikrant Bhaman, Head of Product at Gojek, a widely recognized product leader in Asia, shares his insights into the common [[challenges_and_insights_in_product_management | challenges and insights in product management]] that can impede a product manager's career growth and how to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Impeding Career Growth in Product Management
Vikrant identifies several common pitfalls that can slow down or stall a product manager's career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. He notes that while some of the blame lies with product leadership for not defining clear growth rubrics, certain mindset shifts and behaviors frequently hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

### Three Mindset Shifts that Hinder Growth
1.  **Focusing on Things Beyond Your Control** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>
    *   **The Shift**: Early in a career, product managers (PMs) typically focus on controllable aspects like feedback, personal learning, and individual output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. However, as PMs become mid-senior, conversations often shift to external factors: "Why is the organization not doing this for me?" or "Why can't that stakeholder change?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.
    *   **The Pitfall**: Obsessing over things outside one's control diverts energy and focus from actionable areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
    *   **Correction**: Always maintain focus on what you *can* control, such as your output, contributions, and operating model (as defined in Vikrant's 3 W's framework) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. There's always significant work to be done in mastering data, technology, communication, collaboration, design, research, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

2.  **Relationship with Change (Decreased Rate of Change)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>
    *   **The Shift**: Younger PMs experience a rapid rate of change, constantly acquiring new skills in experimentation, analysis, and stakeholder collaboration, leading to high growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. At mid-senior levels, this rate often slows down as PMs become hesitant to take on new products or responsibilities, fearing the impact on their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
    *   **The Pitfall**: A declining willingness to embrace and drive personal change directly correlates with slower career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
    *   **Correction**: Continuously seek ways to increase your personal rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>. Benchmark yourself against the best in the industry, not just within your organization, to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. Change of team or company can be a last resort, but significant growth opportunities often exist internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

3.  **How You See Yourself (Self-Told Stories)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>
    *   **The Shift**: PMs often define themselves with labels like "high-agency PM" or "hyper-collaborative person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
    *   **The Pitfall**: These self-told stories can become "anti-signals," unconsciously excusing negative behaviors. For example, a "high-agency PM" might feel it's okay to be "brash" or "cut corners," while a "hyper-collaborative person" might excuse indecisiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. These stories define behavior at a basic level, making it hard to correct through formal frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.
    *   **Correction**: Actively identify the stories you tell yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. Seek feedback from trusted individuals if you can't identify them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. Correcting these stories is crucial for getting back on a growth path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. Vikrant's personal example: realizing he wasn't as strong in data or communication as he thought led him to embrace a "learner" mindset, enabling significant personal and professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

> "Figure out what is the story that you are telling yourself. If you are not able to figure that out, talk to the people you trust so that they can tell you that as well and then correct those stories and the moment you are able to correct those stories you may be back on the growth paths again." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>

## Confusion About the Product Management Role
A significant challenge in product management is the inherent ambiguity and lack of a concrete definition for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

*   **Lack of Definition**: Product management is still being defined, with even the strongest definitions being philosophical rather than concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Organizational Variability**: Different technology companies, and even different teams within large companies, define the role very differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Confusion**: This internal ambiguity leads to confusion among other stakeholders, who often ask, "Is a product manager expected to do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
*   **Vikrant's Rule**: If something is blocking product progress, then "yes, the product manager should work on that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.
*   **Art and Science**: Product management is both an art and a science, much like acting or dancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. While there's an artistic element, frameworks and methods (the "science") can help PMs improve their craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

### Focus on Contribution, Not Just Definition
Instead of trying to pinpoint an exact definition, PMs should focus on their tangible contributions and output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.

*   **Core Axes**: PMs should contribute across four core axes: data, design & research, technology, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.
*   **Central Collaborator**: The product management role is unique in that it encircles and collaborates with all these disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>. A PM is the "only one who's pairing with everyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>, gaining a unique holistic insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>.
*   **Role over Title**: PMs should see themselves as playing a crucial role in the team, rather than being defined solely by their title or function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. The goal is to always "up" the team's overall contribution, energy, and output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

## How Product Managers Shoot Themselves in the Foot
PMs can hinder their own progress by:

*   **Obsessing about Impact Too Early**: Especially earlier in their career, PMs can obsess over strategic impact rather than focusing on consistent execution and delivering tangible outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The initial focus should be on getting things "out and done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
*   **Neglecting Artifacts**: Even senior PMs can "shoot themselves in the foot" by not continuing to hone their craft on outputs, such as crafting high-quality Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), product notes, or design briefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The quality of these artifacts reflects a PM's attention to detail and ability to drive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
*   **Being Difficult to Work With**: While it's important to push back on bad ideas, some PMs can become obstacles by pushing back frequently and in a way that is perceived as rude or difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
    *   **Solution**: "Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. The key is to shift the conversation from an emotional space to a logical one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
*   **Drawing Importance to Themselves**: PMs should focus on bringing out important topics without seeking personal recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Trying to Make All Decisions**: A PM's role is to get decisions *made*, not to make all decisions themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Not Being Useful**: The core job of a PM, especially early on, is to "be useful" by making the team more effective and helping the company succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This includes volunteering for tasks that block leaders, even if they seem small, like preparing briefs or review documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

> "A lot of people index on the impact while... they start thinking about goals, they start thinking about direction and they start thinking about strategy while... the very first thing that anyone when you're starting off produces is outputs." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>

## Overcoming Obstacles and [[Becoming a successful product manager | Achieving Success]]

*   **Embrace Feedback as a Gift**: PMs often receive feedback on many dimensions, some of which may not seem important. However, it's crucial to accept feedback and act on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
*   **Strategic Skill Development**: You cannot improve in every area at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. Identify the area that offers the "maximum leverage" for your growth and focus on improving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. For early career PMs, Vikrant recommends picking one skill from data/tech and one from design/research, especially if transitioning from another background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.
*   **Community Enabler**: The product manager serves as the "community enabler" within the team and organization, fostering collaboration towards a common mission. This aspect is particularly vital for remote or distributed teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.
*   **"It's Never Too Late"**: Vikrant emphasizes that it's never too late to pursue what you want to do and be, even if you start your career later or transition functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>. While it can take time to transition, especially if already senior in another function, having a strong product leader as a mentor can make it achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
*   **Effort and Hours**: Despite modern debates, Vikrant holds the "contrarian" belief that putting in effort and hours is still necessary for personal growth and skill improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.
*   **Intent Is Not Enough**: Good intentions alone are insufficient for success. Actions, behavior, communication, and collaboration must align with one's intent to convey true capability and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.

Nikhail Singall, an expert in product leadership and career coaching, emphasizes that continuous feedback and deep [[evaluating_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | self-awareness]] are critical for navigating a successful and fulfilling career, especially for product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:48">[01:50:48]</a>. His insights, drawn from mentoring hundreds of product professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>, highlight common pitfalls and strategies for sustained growth.

## The "Shadows of Superpowers"

A significant challenge for senior leaders is recognizing their "shadows of superpowers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. This concept suggests that the very strengths that propel individuals to success can, at higher levels, become liabilities or development areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. The adage "what got you here isn't what got you there" encapsulates this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

Examples of superpowers creating shadows include:
*   **Collaboration:** An individual might be an excellent collaborator as long as others agree with their viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. As a leader, if they maintain this approach, others may recoil when faced with their strong opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Orientation:** Those amazing at driving growth might struggle with innovation, as their focus is on scaling existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   **Storytelling:** World-class storytellers might find it difficult to engage with intricate details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
*   **Political Savvy:** Being politically strong can sometimes lead to unprincipled decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Structured Thinking:** A structured thinker might struggle with "blue sky" innovations, needing more defined problems to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   **Listening:** Great listeners may be weak at being decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

Leaders often fail to recognize these shadows because these traits are core to their identity and past success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. Recognizing and addressing these hidden development areas is crucial to prevent career plateauing and dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

## Recognizing and Addressing Development Areas

### The Challenge of Feedback
Many individuals struggle to understand why they aren't getting promoted or advancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Oftentimes, asking a direct manager won't reveal the full truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. One of the main reasons is a lack of advocacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Another common issue, especially in the current market, is that the next role simply doesn't exist due to reduced growth or restructuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Impatience can also be a factor, particularly for high performers accustomed to rapid advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

Perhaps the most challenging reason is an unacknowledged development area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. A manager might be poor at identifying it, the individual might refuse to hear it, or they might hear it but be unwilling to change because it clashes with their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### Seeking "Real Feedback"
Formal feedback mechanisms in large companies often fall short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. To truly understand performance and development areas, individuals need to seek "real feedback" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

Key strategies for obtaining real feedback:
*   **Listen Without Justifying**: When receiving feedback, resist the urge to explain or justify your actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   **Triangulate**: Gather feedback from various sources, including peers and individuals who observe you in different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
*   **Create Safety**: For managers, publicly acknowledging and acting on feedback received, even if it's constructive, encourages others to provide more candid input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   **Repeat and Internalize**: A powerful technique is to repeat the feedback back to the giver in your own words, demonstrating not only that you heard it but also that you understand and value it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Dismiss Contradictory Feedback**: Pay close attention to feedback that seems to contradict your perceived strengths or past appraisals. These are often the "anomalies" that reveal true development areas or "shadows of superpowers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

Nikhail Singall personally experienced this when he was told he struggled with collaboration, despite previous reviews praising him for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. This contradictory feedback, from a trusted source, forced him to realize that his strength (being opinionated and decisive as an entrepreneur) was hindering his executive collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

## The Role of Mentorship and Community

The tech industry has historically fallen short in training managers effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This creates [[challenges_of_feedback_in_the_workplace | challenges around bias, enabling coaching, and teaching]], and solving development areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. While self-service learning tools are improving, community-based learning is seen as a powerful "propellant for learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

Nikhail Singall created "The Skip CPO Community" to address the loneliness of leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This community provides a safe and authentic space for Chief Product Officers to share challenges and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Community learning fosters authenticity, trust, and shared solutions for common professional dilemmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

For new managers, Nikhail advises:
*   **Share the Steering Wheel**: Management is not about simply delegating or teaching, but about sharing responsibility like a sidecar on a motorcycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Earn the Right to Manage**: Just like a vampire needing an invitation, a manager must be invited in by their team members, often by asking "What can I help you with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. This approach builds trust and ensures engagement.

## Self-Awareness and Long-Term Career Planning

Singall emphasizes the importance of long-term career planning, advising individuals to "work backwards from your end state" and think of their career as a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This means considering "not the next job, but the one after it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

### The "Dog Tracks" Analogy
Nikhail uses an analogy from dog racing: if a greyhound accidentally caught the mechanical rabbit it was chasing, it would never run again because its purpose was fulfilled, and there was no "what's next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Similarly, many professionals spend their careers chasing a specific goal (e.g., becoming a VP, making a certain amount of money, starting a company) but fail to consider what happens after they achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This can lead to sadness, aimlessness, or destructive behaviors if a new "North Star" isn't established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.

### The "Act 3" of a Career
With careers potentially lasting 60 years or more, professionals must consider "Act 3" â€“ what comes after achieving peak professional success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. There are typically two arcs for Act 3:
1.  **Scaled Economics**: Continuing to pursue wealth accumulation through investing, private equity, or other ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
2.  **Giving Back**: Focusing on contribution, mentoring, or mission-driven work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. Nikhail believes that while early career stages might focus on taking and creating, "Act 3" offers a profound opportunity for giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

Nikhail's personal "Act 3" is dedicated to coaching and giving back, helping others change their trajectory through timely advice, and seeking to scale this impact like a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

### Crafting Your Career Story
A key piece of advice for all product managers is to ensure that the story they will tell about their current work is meaningful for their "skip" job (the job after the next one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. This involves articulating:
*   The problem solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>
*   The skills built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>
*   The headwinds faced and overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>
*   Using "I" statements, not "we" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>

If this story isn't compelling, it's a signal to consider making changes to create a more impactful narrative for future career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>.

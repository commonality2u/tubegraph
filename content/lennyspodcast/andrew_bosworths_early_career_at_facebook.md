Andrew "Boz" Bosworth, currently the Chief Technology Officer of [[growth_tactics_at_facebook_and_meta | Meta]], joined Facebook in early 2006 as one of its pioneering engineers, specifically among the 10th to 16th engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. His 18-year tenure has seen him create some of the internet's most impactful products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## The Gritty Reality of Early Facebook

Contrary to romanticized portrayals, such as in movies like *The Social Network*, the early days at Facebook were characterized by significant struggle and sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Bosworth recalls not sleeping more than four hours at a time for two years, having to wake up every four hours to check anti-spam reports and defend the site from attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. He worked 120 hours per week, had no hobbies, gained weight, and admitted to drinking a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

The environment fostered a strong sense of camaraderie, though memories were "formed in a forge of really intense times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Most engineers lived within a mile of the office and ate meals together, often due to continuous work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. A key challenge was the lack of internal experts; engineers had to solve problems themselves, even going to Fry's Electronics to buy components and build new servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Unlike today's startup ecosystem, professional services for payroll, finance, IT, and HR were largely nonexistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Bosworth sacrificed a significant portion of his twenties, socially, during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Foundational Projects and Innovations

During his early years, Bosworth was instrumental in developing several core Facebook products:
*   **[[challenges_and_innovations_in_developing_facebooks_newsfeed | Facebook News Feed]]**: This was his early project and the first algorithmically ranked content feed of any social network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. It was also the first consumer AI implemented in a website to rank content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:08">[03:53:08]</a>. Initially, the News Feed was highly controversial, with users expressing outrage, yet simultaneously doubling their product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This highlighted a "cognitive dissonance" between stated and revealed preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:07">[03:12:07]</a>. Bosworth admitted to "screwing some things up" in its initial execution, like putting wall posts on main feed for everyone to see, but maintained that the core idea was right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **Facebook Mobile Ads Platform**: He built the original mobile ads platform and ran it for four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. This platform became "the most efficient monetizing surface in history outside of search," generating trillions of dollars in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:08">[03:58:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:07">[07:17:07]</a>.
*   **Other Contributions**: He also helped build and scale the Facebook messaging system, the profile, the timeline, Facebook Groups, and the internal engineering boot camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>. He created the company's AR/VR organization (now Reality Labs) in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>.

## Evolution of Career and Passion

Bosworth's career path at Facebook was characterized by frequent shifts in roles, almost every six months in his early years, driven by a desire for aggressive learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:07">[03:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:07">[03:20:07]</a>. He compares it to *Karate Kid*, where he "painted a lot of fences" and "waxed a lot of cars" to eventually "know karate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:07">[03:44:07]</a>. While peers initially advanced faster in single tracks, his diverse experience eventually led to a "vertical" career trajectory, particularly after leading the ads platform for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:07">[04:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:07">[04:19:07]</a>.

A key lesson for him was the importance of passion. While working on the News Feed, he felt "consumed more fully than anything in life had ever consumed me," realizing that passion leads to better, smarter, and orders-of-magnitude more productive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:07">[03:30:07]</a>. He later discovered his ability to become passionate about new areas, such as ads (initially resisting as he saw himself as an "AI infrastructure product guy") and hardware (initially resisting as a "software guy") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:07">[03:56:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>. His advice is to "optimize for learning" in early career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:07">[04:31:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:07">[04:35:07]</a>.

## Insights on Leadership and Communication

Bosworth believes that "communication is the job" for anyone aspiring to have an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:07">[05:31:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:07">[05:43:07]</a>. He takes "extreme ownership" for communication failures, stating that if a team member delivers the wrong outcome, it's his responsibility for not communicating clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:07">[05:18:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:07">[05:36:07]</a>. He emphasizes that "you cannot not communicate," as silence, body language, and even clothes convey messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:07">[05:38:07]</a>.

He highlights the importance of understanding the mental model of the audience—whether it's managers, technical leaders, or the general public—and tailoring communication (language, presence, persona) to guide them towards a desired understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:07">[05:53:07]</a>. This includes using multiple modalities (e.g., all-hands meetings followed by written posts) and addressing people's fears and concerns upfront to build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:07">[05:46:07]</a>.

He cites [[mark_zuckerbergs_leadership_and_transformation | Mark Zuckerberg's]] ability to receive feedback, often initially disagreeing, but later subtly incorporating it into his thinking, as an example of "strong opinions loosely held" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:07">[06:39:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:07">[06:51:07]</a>.

## Personal Failures and Identity Threat

Bosworth's most significant regrets are "personal failures" where he negatively affected another person due to losing control of his emotions, often driven by "identity threat" – the feeling that a core part of his self-perception was being questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:07">[07:21:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:07">[07:46:07]</a>.

He recounts a vivid memory from his early twenties during a technical debate about RPC (Remote Procedure Call) encoding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:07">[07:51:07]</a>. He vehemently argued for binary encoding for efficiency, while a colleague, Dave Federman, advocated for human-readable, plain English descriptors for easier debugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:07">[07:51:07]</a>. In a room full of engineers, Bosworth became visibly angry, sweating and turning red, feeling his identity caught up in being right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:07">[08:24:07]</a>. He later realized Dave was right, and a simple solution was to build both encoders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:07">[08:23:07]</a>. This embarrassing incident taught him to recontextualize himself and prioritize open-mindedness and curiosity over being right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:07">[08:39:07]</a>. He learned that people remember "how you made them feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:07">[09:18:07]</a>, and making others feel unsafe is a true failure.

He credits a colleague, Ami Vora, for demonstrating the power of "profound curiosity" in disagreements. Vora would respond to even "crazy wrong" statements with "fascinating, you have to tell me more about why you think that," which disarmed people and fostered openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:07">[09:27:07]</a>. This approach allowed her to influence others and change her own mind, a key lesson Bosworth has since tried to model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:07">[09:41:07]</a>.

Notion's journey highlights a unique philosophy of [[company_growth_and_scaling_challenges | growth]] and operational efficiency, prioritizing a lean approach even as it scaled to a multi-billion dollar valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This strategy was deeply influenced by its challenging early years and a commitment to core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## The "Lost Years" and Early Survival

The first three to four years of Notion, starting in 2013, are described as "the Lost Years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. During this period, Notion experimented with many different versions of its product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Initially, Notion tried to build an easy-to-use developer tool to help more people create software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. However, after a couple of years, they realized most people didn't care about creating software; they wanted to get their jobs done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This first version was built more for the founders' desires than for user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

A crucial realization was to "hide their vision" – enabling everyone to create software – within a form factor people *do* care about: productivity software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This was likened to hiding "broccoli" (the vision) inside "sugar" (productivity tools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. It took two years to fully pivot to building a productivity tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

### The Courage to Reset
Notion rebuilt its code many times, even restarting the company's technical foundation at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. They had initially bet on a new, unstable technology (Web Components from Google) and eventually had to discard years of work to rebuild on a more stable foundation like React <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This required laying off the entire team, bringing the company back to just the two co-founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

The founders' ability to persevere through these lean times was attributed to:
*   **Belief in the vision:** A deep conviction that the product needed to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   **Staying lean:** Operating with minimal overhead, reducing the need for constant fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Personal resilience:** The ability to reset mentally, often achieved by getting enough sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a> and changing environments (e.g., moving to Japan to code) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Courage to reset:** Not being afraid to abandon sunk costs and rebuild from scratch, understanding that "better abstractions" can lead to faster progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

## Philosophy of Leanness and Efficiency

Notion's operational strategy is built on a few core principles:

*   **Talent Density:** Instead of tracking the number of people, Notion focuses on "talent density" and "revenue per employee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. This creates a positive compounding loop where talented people want to work with other talented individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
*   **"Small Bus" Metaphor:** Internally, Notion uses the metaphor of a "small bus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. A smaller bus is easier to turn, accelerate, and maneuver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. Leaders decide who sits on the bus, which dictates the speed and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. This helps optimize for a tight, lean team. This approach is key to [[optimizing_hiring_and_team_management_for_tech_startups | optimizing hiring and team management]].
*   **System over People:** The belief that "better system is much better than progress through people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. Notion itself, as a meta-tool, is used internally to run almost everything, minimizing internal communication overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. This mindset accidentally led to keeping high costs low and the company profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. This demonstrates how a [[small_team_management_and_operational_efficiency_in_startups | small team can achieve operational efficiency]].
*   **Financial Discipline:** Notion has been profitable for a couple of years and has retained most of the money it raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. They didn't hire a salesperson until they hit over $10 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>, and their first PM was hired at around 50 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. This financial stability allows them to focus on building without constant pressure to find more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

## Craft and Values in Product Building

Notion's approach to product development is rooted in a "craft and values" philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.
*   **Craft:** Involves applying one's values to technical know-how to make clever tradeoffs and create something new and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. This is akin to a wood cabinet builder who aims to make something beautiful, useful, and pleasant to touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.
*   **Balance of Self and User:** Building a product requires balancing personal values and aesthetics with user needs and business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. Too much self-focus leads to an "art project" with no users, while too much business focus results in a "commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.
*   **Thoughtful Environment:** The physical office environment is treated as an extension of this philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. Notion's office is designed to feel like an artist's studio or home, with cozy furniture and careful lighting, fostering creativity and comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. Conference rooms are named after "timeless tools" to inspire the team to create durable, impactful software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

## Strategic Trade-offs and Horizontal Growth

Building a horizontal product like Notion involves continuous strategic trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.
*   **"Lego Bricks" vs. "Lego Boxes":** While Notion's core is "Lego bricks" (fundamental building blocks like relational databases), the market often demands "Lego boxes" (ready-made solutions for specific use cases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Moving upmarket to enterprise customers requires offering solutions that fit their P&L and risk profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.
*   **Market Segmentation:** For a horizontal product, effective segmentation is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Notion initially found broad appeal through notes and documents, which acted as a "large top of funnel" for its B2C2B [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. Many personal users adopted Notion for simple note-taking and document sharing, then brought it into their workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>.
*   **Bundling and Unbundling:** The market cycles between "bundling and unbundling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>. While SaaS led to an unbundling of many vertical tools, the current trend (driven by AI and macro factors) is shifting back towards bundling, where more value can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>. Notion's horizontal nature benefits from this, as it allows users to address multiple use cases (project management, CRM, docs) in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.
*   **Leveraging AI:** The rise of AI, particularly language models, has been a significant gift for Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. AI's strength in reasoning and understanding is amplified when all information resides in one place, making horizontal tools like Notion highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>. Notion is exploring AI writing, Q&A, and, most fascinatingly, using AI coding agents to piece together Lego blocks and create custom knowledge software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>. This aligns with [[developing_growth_loops_and_flywheel_strategies | developing growth loops]] and leveraging AI to build more value.

Notion's growth reflects a journey of persistent adherence to core values, strategic pivots, and disciplined execution, allowing them to navigate the complexities of building a horizontal product while maintaining a lean and efficient operation.

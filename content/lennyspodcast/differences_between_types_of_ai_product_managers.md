A product manager (PM) is generally responsible for uniting design, engineering, business development, operations, and sales within an organization to ship impactful solutions for customers [00:06:33]. The role involves representing the customer and finding solutions to their problems [00:06:47].

When discussing the role of product managers in the context of AI, Aman Khan, Director of Product at Arise AI, categorizes them into three distinct types or "flavors" of [[ai_in_product_management | AI product management]] [00:06:54].

## Types of AI Product Managers

### 1. AI Platform PMs
[[ai_in_product_management | AI Platform PMs]] are responsible for building tools specifically for AI engineers [00:07:07]. Aman Khan identifies with this role in his work at Arise AI, a platform focused on observability and evaluation for artificial intelligence [00:07:10].

Historically, Arise AI focused on machine learning models like ranking, regression, classification, and recommender systems [00:07:19]. More recently, their focus has shifted to broader AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) [00:07:31]. The tools for building on top of LLMs and understanding their performance are still in their early stages [00:07:50]. The primary goal of an [[ai_in_product_management | AI Platform PM]] is to enable AI engineers to comprehend the impact of their work and how it translates to business outcomes [00:08:09].

### 2. AI Product PMs
[[ai_in_product_management | AI Product PMs]] are those whose core product is entirely centered around AI [00:08:32]. In this role, the core user experience is enabled by the underlying AI model, which often serves as the "secret sauce" [00:08:51]. Product managers in this category work to package advanced AI technology developed by researchers and engineers, making it consumable for businesses, enterprises, or consumers [00:09:00]. Examples of products managed by [[ai_in_product_management | AI Product PMs]] include platforms like ChatGPT or Notebook LM [00:08:40].

### 3. AI-Powered PMs
The third type is the [[applications_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_for_product_managers | AI-powered PM]]. These product managers are significantly enabled by AI technology across the entire stack of their existing product management role [00:09:36]. Unlike the other types, [[applications_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_for_product_managers | AI-powered PMs]] are not necessarily responsible for building core AI models from scratch, nor do they typically have access to the extensive resources of research teams found at companies like Google or OpenAI [00:09:54]. Instead, their focus is on leveraging existing large language models or other AI models to create the best possible experience for their customers [00:10:05].

This trend suggests that as AI becomes more pervasive, most product managers will likely fall into one of these [[changing_role_of_product_management_with_ai | AI-enabled categories]] [00:10:16]. Aman Khan believes that AI will become as common as databases for SaaS applications [00:10:21].

#### Tools for AI-Powered PMs
[[applications_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_for_product_managers | AI-powered PMs]] utilize various tools to enhance their efficiency and productivity:
*   **Prototyping and Code Generation:**
    *   Cursor and Replit help to build prototypes quickly and understand what's possible, even if the prototypes are not production-ready [00:11:07].
    *   Vercel, with its V0 feature, allows users to type a prompt and generate a landing page or working UI, providing a strong starting point for mockups [00:11:34].
*   **Graphic Design and Visualization:**
    *   AI tools like Midjourney and DALL-E can be used for graphic design, logo creation, or generating visual user stories, making them highly approachable for experience-focused companies [00:12:02].
*   **3D Modeling:** Emerging tools in 3D modeling are making it easier to develop physical products [00:12:41].

### Breaking into AI Product Management
Aman Khan suggests that it might be easier to break into [[ai_in_product_management | AI product management]] now than it was previously [00:00:30]. Before, a stronger foundation in machine learning was often required [00:00:44]. Today, there are numerous YouTube videos demonstrating how to build an app in about an hour using AI tools [00:00:37].

To succeed as an [[ai_in_product_management | AI Product Manager]], whether building infrastructure or AI products, an obsession with the end customer and their problems is crucial [00:14:29]. The goal is to push the boundaries of technology to solve those problems [00:14:43].

#### Key Skills and Recommendations
To become an [[ai_in_product_management | AI PM]], individuals should:
1.  **Understand Fundamentals:** Gain a foundational understanding of what machine learning and AI are and the knowledge powering their evolution [00:19:10]. Resources like Andrej Karpathy's videos on the foundations of LLMs are recommended [00:19:40].
2.  **Experiment with Tools:** Actively use AI tools to explore and push the boundaries of what's possible [00:20:06]. This combination of theoretical understanding and practical application drives skill development [00:20:12].
3.  **Build a Portfolio:** Since there isn't a specific college degree for [[ai_in_product_management | AI product management]], standing out requires demonstrating interest and building a personal skill set [00:20:28]. Creating a portfolio of prototypes or actual products built with AI showcases one's thinking and interests to hiring managers [00:20:49]. For instance, using tools like Replit, one can build and host a website in seconds, or use Vercel, Midjourney, and DALL-E to storyboard ideas [00:22:50]. Having such a portfolio helps address core hiring questions: "Can this person do the job?", "Are they excited about the work?", and "Do I like to work with them?" [00:21:17].

The increasing ease of building with AI means that future product managers will need to adapt and embrace these technologies to stay relevant. The [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | impact of AI on product management]] means PMs are ideally positioned to thrive, as their core role of identifying problems and articulating solutions is amplified by AI's ability to build things rapidly [00:26:08]. The challenge shifts from *how* to build to *what* to build [00:26:22].

## Thriving as an AI Product Manager
The top 5% of [[ai_in_product_management | AI product managers]] distinguish themselves by avoiding the tendency to simply replicate existing AI interfaces (like chatbots) and instead focus on what their business truly needs [00:31:37]. When ChatGPT launched, many companies initially built internal chatbots on their knowledge bases, but the actual usage of these tools was often low [00:30:53].

A top [[role_and_impact_of_ai_in_product_management | AI PM]] understands that the right interface for AI might look very different from a chatbot. It could involve optimizing existing processes to make human lives easier [00:32:03]. The key is to avoid fitting technology to a problem (e.g., "we need an AI agent for this") and instead focus on the core problem itself, leveraging AI as a tool [00:33:37].

### Finding Good AI Ideas
To foster good [[the_role_of_ai_in_transforming_product_management | AI-oriented ideas]] within a company:
1.  **Define a Metric for AI Prototypes:** Companies often lack a clear metric for measuring the impact of AI prototypes that don't directly move core business metrics like revenue [00:36:50]. Tracking the number of "shots taken" (prototypes or experiments) can provide a measure of activity and learning [00:37:26].
2.  **Conduct Hackathons:** Hackathons remove barriers to entry and encourage hands-on experimentation with AI [00:37:32]. The goal is to get everyone in the organization to try using AI tools [00:37:43]. This helps identify which problems AI can effectively solve and which it cannot [00:38:00].
3.  **Obsess Over User Experience Details:** Study successful AI products and understand what makes them "magical" [00:39:51]. Often, successful AI products do not fully automate tasks but leave some "knobs and levers" for the user to maintain a sense of control, akin to the "Ikea effect" [00:40:41]. This approach makes the product easier to use and lowers the barrier to creation without completely removing human involvement [00:42:31].

### Navigating the Challenges
Being a successful [[role_and_impact_of_ai_in_product_management | AI Product Manager]] requires specific approaches:
*   **Influence and Communication:** AI tools amplify a PM's ability to communicate ideas effectively through functional prototypes, influencing design, engineering, and leadership [00:27:43].
*   **"Walking and Chewing Gum":** A top [[future_of_product_management_with_ai | AI PM]] must continuously deliver customer value and move business metrics while simultaneously creating space for prototyping, experimenting, and learning from failures [00:43:22]. The [[future_of_product_management_with_ai | AI technology]] changes rapidly, so accepting that not every experiment will work is crucial for iterative improvement [00:44:52].
*   **Curiosity and Enthusiasm:** A genuine interest and curiosity in the [[ai_in_product_management_and_implications_for_startups | AI space]] are vital for staying ahead and identifying new applications [00:35:36]. This involves consistently seeking out "cool new things" and applying them within the company [00:25:25].
*   **Embrace Wandering:** In the uncertain landscape of AI, a PM should be comfortable with "wandering" â€“ actively exploring unknown directions and seeking signal without waiting for clear directives [00:59:01]. This contrasts with a "waiting" approach where companies might delay building until the next foundational AI model emerges [00:58:16].
*   **Amplify Signal Through Noise:** AI tools can be used to scale a PM's ability to gather insights. For instance, using LLMs to analyze transcripts from customer calls can quickly identify common pain points, acting as a "superpower" by allowing the PM to be in many places at once [01:02:05].

Ultimately, the [[role_and_impact_of_ai_in_product_management | AI PM's role]] is to convey the right thing to build amidst the significant excitement and "buzz" around AI [01:46:39]. The toughest but most impactful part of the job is synthesizing this signal to solve customer problems [01:46:50].

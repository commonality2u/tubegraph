People often believe that invention takes an extensive amount of time, but the initial idea might only require a couple of hours once a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The more significant effort, however, often lies in the expression and refinement of that idea, which can span years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

For instance:
*   A newsletter concept can take years to fully express <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Amazon Prime, a 20-year-old idea, is still undergoing improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   The Kindle, a decade-old idea, continues to be refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The key insight is that one does not need many good ideas to be perceived as highly inventive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Inventiveness as a Leadership Principle

Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon and holder of over 70 patents, highlights the importance of inventiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, identified himself primarily as an inventor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Amazon's goal under Bezos was to become the "Invention Machine," a company systematically capable of out-inventing competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. This focus is embedded in Amazon's leadership principles, such as "Think Big" and "Invent and Simplify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

> [!INFO] **Systematic Invention Process**
> To become systematically inventive, one needs to:
> 1.  Be an expert in the area of desired invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
> 2.  Dedicate focused time to thinking, away from distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.
> 3.  Combine two existing concepts rather than seeking something entirely new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

### Example: Drone Delivery Patent
Ethan Evans holds a patent for a drone delivery system where drones operate from a slow-moving truck, akin to an aircraft carrier for drones, rather than flying directly from a warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. This idea originated from thinking about drones and delivery, combined with military history and the concept of an aircraft carrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

## The Role of Optimization and Incremental [[innovations_in_product_design_and_user_experience|Innovations in Product Design and User Experience]]

Jeff Bezos emphasizes that much of [[innovation_within_large_organizations|innovation within large organizations]] and work occurs in the optimizing phase, making products cheaper, better, and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. The initial idea is just the starting point; the hard work is in making it scalable and affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.

Amazon Prime exemplifies this:
*   It began as an idea for fast, free shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.
*   It expanded from two-day to one-day, and eventually same-day delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.
*   Additional benefits like Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Gaming, and free photo storage were incrementally added, turning Prime into a comprehensive offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. Bezos's goal was to make Prime a "no-brainer" for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_struggling_moments_in_product_innovation|The Role of Struggling Moments in Product Innovation]] and Learning

A significant failure during the launch of the Amazon App Store provided crucial lessons related to [[innovation_within_large_organizations|innovation within large organizations]] and product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

> [!WARNING] **Lessons from a Public Failure**
> When facing a major product failure, especially with high visibility:
> 1.  **Own the problem:** Take immediate responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
> 2.  **Prioritize and Communicate:** Proactively update stakeholders on the problem, the plan, and expected next updates to rebuild trust and prevent micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.
> 3.  **Seek in-person interaction:** Addressing anger face-to-face is often more productive than through electronic communication, as it's harder to maintain hostility in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.
> 4.  **Work hard to recover:** Demonstrate commitment by putting in the necessary effort, even outside regular hours, to resolve the issue promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
> 5.  **Address underlying issues:** Reflect on systemic failures, such as insufficient oversight for junior engineers, and address them to prevent future recurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.
> 6.  **Reassure team members:** Support those directly involved, especially junior staff, who might feel undue responsibility for mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.

One major lesson learned was the risk of "surprise launches," where teams are surprised by what doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. A shift towards extensive beta testing, even with the risk of leaks, is preferable to a flawless but untested launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Leaders in large organizations must "Fear The New York Times headline," meaning they should be acutely aware of how a mistake could affect public perception and brand reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

## [[impact_of_company_size_and_culture_on_innovation|Impact of Company Size and Culture on Innovation]]

Ethan Evans holds a contrarian opinion regarding the return-to-office movement, especially concerning [[innovation_within_large_organizations|innovation within large organizations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>. Offices, first built in 1726, have had 300 years to optimize, with limited recent improvements (e.g., open offices are often debated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>. In contrast, remote work has only been widely adopted for a few years, presenting significant untapped potential for improvement and [[innovations_in_product_design_and_user_experience|innovations in product design and user experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. Long-term, remote work is likely to prove superior due to its greater capacity for ongoing development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>.

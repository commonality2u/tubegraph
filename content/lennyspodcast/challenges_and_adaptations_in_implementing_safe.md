From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

[[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)]] emerged from a desire to scale Scrum and other agile processes for larger organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While intended to provide a structured approach for tying multiple agile teams together at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>, its implementation often presents significant [[challenges in Product Organizations | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

## Criticisms of [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]]

Many experts advise against using [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] in its dogmatic form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Organizations that have found success with [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] typically end up modifying it significantly, deviating from its prescriptive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

Key criticisms include:
*   **Over-prescription and Rigidity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>: [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] prescribes a detailed operating model for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>, leading to an "Overkill" of processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>. This rigid adherence often results in excessive meetings and a focus on process over actual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
*   **Lack of Product Management Depth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>: [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] does not adequately describe how to perform critical product management activities like experimentation, market research, or data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
*   **Product Owner Role Limitations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>: In [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]], the Product Owner role is often reduced to an "order-taker," primarily focused on maintaining backlogs and writing user stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. This narrow focus prevents Product Owners from engaging in strategic discovery or customer interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Disconnect from Value and Strategy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>: Organizations using [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] may prioritize delivering software based on roadmaps without checking if it's the "right" thing to build or if it aligns with business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.
*   **Developer Reliance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>: Developers can become overly reliant on Product Owners for direction, hindering their ability to identify and address technical debt or other important work independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.
*   **Lack of Career Path Clarity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>: The distinct Product Owner role in [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] often lacks a clear career trajectory into strategic product management roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Incentives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>: The "agile industrial complex," including [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] and Scrum organizations, generates revenue by selling certifications and consulting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>, which can incentivize adoption regardless of true organizational fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

An example of a problematic implementation of [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] is a water company in the Netherlands that went bankrupt because its IT teams got so caught up in the process of adopting [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] that they failed to deploy a new invoicing system, preventing them from collecting payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.

## Reasons for [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] Adoption

Despite its drawbacks, [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] is widely adopted, especially by large, non-tech companies such as banks, insurance, and pharmaceutical companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This is primarily because these organizations:
*   Did not traditionally grow up building software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
*   Seek a structured method to implement rigor at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.
*   Find [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] appealing because it offers a "plug-and-play" map of what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>, appealing to new leaders or those unfamiliar with technology organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.

## Effective Digital Transformations and Adaptations

For organizations seeking to improve their product development, focusing on [[agile_methodologies_and_their_implications_in_large_organizations | agile methodologies]] as principles rather than rigid dogma is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. The goal should be to move quickly and deliver great value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>.

Recommendations for leaders in digital transformations:
*   **Comprehensive Operating Model** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>: Develop a holistic product operating model that includes product strategy, organizational design, product operations, culture, and incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Outcomes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>: Shift from rewarding output (shipping features) to rewarding valuable outcomes tied to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.
*   **Enable Product Teams** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>: Provide infrastructure and processes that enable product managers and development teams to access data and interact directly with customers for effective discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   **Clear Career Paths** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>: Establish clear career ladders for product roles, recognizing that product management is a business role that can lead to leadership positions managing product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.
*   **Strategic Staffing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>: Intersperse experienced product leaders (e.g., CPOs, VPs of Product) who can mentor and upskill internal talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. These leaders often come from software-native backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning Mindset** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>: Leaders should commit to continuous learning and foster a culture where teams can "inspect and adapt" their processes based on what truly serves the company and its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.

## Bridging the Product Owner and Product Manager Divide

The Product Owner role, as defined in Scrum, originated as a way to help developers prioritize work, not as a product management role in the modern sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Many large tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Netflix do not have Product Owners; they exclusively employ Product Managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.

For Product Owners, [[challenges and realities of working as a product manager | navigating the role]] and aspiring to product management:
*   **Take Ownership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>: Challenge assumptions and push back on tasks that don't align with value delivery. Focus on *why* work is being done and its desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.
*   **Seek Customer Interaction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>: Actively seek opportunities to engage with customers and understand their needs, even if it's perceived as the Product Manager's primary responsibility.
*   **Focus on Value and Outcomes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>: When describing work, emphasize the problems solved for users and the measurable business impact, rather than just process adherence (e.g., "prioritized backlog") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.
*   **Question Certifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>: While some organizations require certifications like Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO), they don't guarantee competence in true product management. Real experience in solving customer problems and driving outcomes is valued more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.

Ideally, organizations should unify "Product Owner" and "Product Manager" titles under a single "Product Manager" career path, with different levels (e.g., Associate Product Manager, Product Manager, Senior Product Manager) to reflect varying experience and skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[challenges in Strategy Implementation | challenges]] in implementing [[overview_of_scaled_agile_framework_safe | SAFe]] and other rigid frameworks stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of what it takes to build great products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. While frameworks can provide structure, true transformation requires investing in skilled people, fostering a culture of continuous learning, and focusing on delivering customer value and achieving business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>. Organizations that are not software-native can still achieve product excellence by adapting principles from successful tech companies, integrating experienced product leaders, and ensuring software strategy is intertwined with overall company strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.

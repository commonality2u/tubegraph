Product positioning is crucial for success in the B2B tech space, particularly given the high rate of "no-decision" outcomes in B2B purchase processes. Between 40% to 60% of B2B purchase processes conclude with no decision being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The majority of these indecisions are not due to buyers finding existing solutions better, but rather their inability to confidently make a choice, leading them to delay the purchase as a safe, risk-free option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Effective positioning helps potential customers get excited about a product and decide to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. It addresses the buyer's underlying fear of making a wrong choice that could impact their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:16">[02:22:16]</a>.

## April Dunford's Methodology for Effective Sales Pitching

April Dunford, author of "Obviously Awesome" and "Sales Pitch," presents a framework for crafting sales pitches that effectively communicate a product's positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. The core idea is to shift from a mere product exposition to a storytelling approach that highlights differentiated value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

The pitch structure consists of two main parts: the **setup** and the **follow-through** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### The Setup

The setup portion of the pitch is about the market and the company's point of view, not directly about the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. It should be a conversational "discovery" process with the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.

1.  **Insight into the Market**: Begin by sharing an insight or a unique point of view on the market, often stemming from the problem the product was built to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. This insight should resonate with the target customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>.
    *   *Example (Help Scout)*: Digital businesses view customer service as a growth driver, not merely a cost center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.
2.  **Pluses and Minuses of Alternative Solutions**: Paint a comprehensive picture of the market by discussing the pros and cons of existing alternative solutions. This helps the buyer understand where your solution fits and educates them on how to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>.
    *   *Example (Help Scout)*: Shared inboxes are easy but lack growth features; traditional help desk software is complex and cost-focused, not customer experience-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
3.  **Perfect World/Desired Criteria**: Conclude the setup by defining what a "really good solution" would look like, based on the insights and alternatives discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. This step aims to align the customer's worldview with your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. If the customer agrees with this ideal vision, they are mentally "won" even before the product is introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:40">[01:56:40]</a>.
    *   *Example (Help Scout)*: A perfect solution would be as easy to use as a shared inbox, offer robust features for growth, and be built to deliver amazing customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.

### The Follow-Through

Once alignment is established in the setup, the follow-through part of the pitch focuses on the product and its unique value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

1.  **Introduce Your Product**: Briefly introduce your product within its market category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:21">[01:57:21]</a>.
    *   *Example (Help Scout)*: "We're Help Scout, customer service software for digital businesses." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:36">[01:57:36]</a>
2.  **Differentiated Value**: This is the core of the pitch. Present the value your product delivers that no other solution can, linking it directly to your unique capabilities and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. The majority of the sales call time should be spent here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>.
3.  **Proof**: Provide evidence that you can deliver on the promised value. This often involves customer case studies or independent third-party verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
4.  **Handle Objections**: Address potential silent objections or concerns that haven't been explicitly raised, such as cost, ease of adoption, or security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:17">[01:59:17]</a>. This is crucial for navigating the complex B2B buying process, where multiple stakeholders can derail a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:05">[03:11:05]</a>.
5.  **The Ask**: Clearly state the desired next step in the sales process, whether it's closing the deal, scheduling a proof of concept, or involving other stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:21">[01:55:21]</a>.

## The Role of Differentiated Value

[[april_dunfords_methodology_for_effective_positioning | Differentiated value]] is the answer to the question: "Why pick us over the other alternatives?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>. It stems from capabilities or features that are unique to your product or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>. This unique capability then translates into unique value that competitors cannot deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:45">[01:44:45]</a>.

If the [[challenges_and_signs_of_weak_product_positioning | differentiated value]] isn't clear or compelling, customers will question the need to pay for the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:37">[01:43:37]</a>. For companies with happy, engaged customers, differentiated value already exists; the task is to identify and articulate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Signs of Weak Product Positioning

One of the biggest [[challenges_and_signs_of_weak_product_positioning | challenges]] in B2B sales is customer indecision, where buyers are more afraid of "screwing up" than "missing out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. Attempts to combat this indecision by using "fear of missing out" (FOMO) tactics can actually worsen the situation, as it adds more stress to an already anxious buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:03">[02:54:03]</a>. Instead, focus on providing the tools and guidance to help buyers make confident decisions and [[steps_to_develop_and_align_on_product_positioning | mitigate risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:03">[02:43:03]</a>.

Signs of weak positioning in a sales pitch include:
*   The pitch being a mere "product exposition" of features without conveying value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   Customers being confused about how the product differs from competitors or if it's genuinely better than existing alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   A high rate of deals ending in "no decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>.

## Positioning vs. Category Creation

While category creation can lead to a big business, it is not the only way to build a legendary business; most successful companies did not create their categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Many successful "category creators" actually started as niche plays within existing categories, becoming dominant before expanding the category boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This is known as the "bowling pin strategy," where a company dominates a small segment before expanding into adjacent areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:24">[03:22:24]</a>.

A sales pitch focused on a "shift" or "trend" (like some category creation pitches) can be problematic if the trend isn't unique to your solution, as competitors can also leverage the same narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:47">[03:12:47]</a>. Additionally, in a sales context, customers seek immediate value, not just long-term disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:20">[03:14:20]</a>.

## Implementing and Measuring Positioning Success

To successfully implement a new positioning and pitch:
1.  **Cross-functional Collaboration**: Ensure product, marketing, and sales teams work together on defining differentiated value. This shared understanding leads to a better definition of value and more effective pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Sales Involvement**: Sales representatives must be involved in building the pitch; otherwise, they are unlikely to adopt it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
3.  **Pilot Testing**: Train your best sales representative on the new pitch and have them test it with qualified prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Huddle after each pitch to refine wording and flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
4.  **Sales-Led Rollout**: Once the best rep confirms the new pitch is more effective than the old one, have them train and "sell" it to the rest of the sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. This peer-to-peer approach is more effective than marketing simply "heaving" content over the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

The immediate impact of a well-defined positioning and pitch is often seen in sales, with a higher percentage of deals converting from the first sales call into opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Some companies have doubled their deal conversion rates simply by tightening up their pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Positioning work can take about a week, and rolling out the new pitch can be done in about a month for motivated teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

## Role of Teams

*   **Marketing**: Marketing typically becomes the "stewards" or "positioning police" for the new positioning, ensuring consistent messaging across all channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. They partner with sales leadership to certify reps on the pitch quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   **Product**: Product teams deeply understand the product's features and value, and their input is vital in defining the [[steps_to_develop_and_align_on_product_positioning | differentiated value]] during the positioning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Sales**: Sales teams are critical for providing insights into common objections and customer needs during the positioning development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. They execute the pitch and provide feedback for refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

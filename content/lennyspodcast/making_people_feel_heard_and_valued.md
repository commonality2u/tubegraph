Making people feel heard and valued is a critical skill for leaders and managers, particularly during difficult conversations or organizational changes. Failure to do so can lead to anger, resentment, and a breakdown of trust within a team or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Importance of Being Heard

When individuals within an organization do not feel heard, they may feel ignored, passed over, or disrespected, leading to decreased morale and increased friction in information flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. This is particularly crucial during sensitive events like layoffs, where a lack of personalization can make people feel dehumanized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Techniques for Making People Feel Heard

Effective communication and active listening are key to ensuring individuals feel heard. Matt Mohari, an executive coach, outlines several tactical approaches:

### 1. Facilitating Input in Group Settings

When solving problems or gathering opinions in a group, instead of going around verbally, ask everyone to write down their solutions simultaneously (e.g., for five minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. Collect these in a shared document and read them, acknowledging each person's contribution by name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. This ensures everyone's input is seen and acknowledged.

### 2. Repeating Back for Understanding

For verbal communication, ask the person to state their thoughts, then repeat back what you heard to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. Continue to repeat and refine your understanding until they confirm that your summary is accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This confirms that you have truly understood their message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

### 3. Reflecting Unspoken Thoughts and Emotions

This is a deeper level of [[Effective listening and communication as a leader | listening]] and is especially useful when receiving feedback. People often "couch," "polish," or "round the edges" of their true thoughts to avoid hurting feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. To make them feel truly heard, reflect back what you *imagine* their true, unstated thoughts or emotions might be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>.

For example, if you perceive anger, you might say, "I think what I'm hearing you say is you're pissed off and you're thinking 'screw you Matt, how dare you walk into the office and not even say hello to me?' Is that close?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. Often, their thoughts are "bigger than their words," and by verbalizing these deeper sentiments, they feel deeply understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

### 4. Following Up on Feedback

After making someone feel heard, the process isn't complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. You must then either:
*   **Accept the feedback** and clearly state what actions you will take as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.
*   **Decline the feedback** but explain your reasoning by sharing your own context and perspective, hoping their feedback might change once they understand your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.

## Application in Difficult Situations: Layoffs

The method of ensuring people feel heard is paramount during challenging events like layoffs.

### One-on-One Communication
The most significant factor determining a successful layoff versus a botched one is whether the individual hears the news from their manager in a one-on-one conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Receiving news via email or group chat is "terrible" because it feels dehumanizing and doesn't allow the person to express their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Preparing for the Conversation
Before delivering difficult news, warn the person that the conversation will be challenging and allow them a few seconds to mentally prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This reduces the element of surprise that can trigger a strong emotional response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.

### Allowing Emotional Release
After delivering the news, explicitly invite the person to share their feelings, acknowledging that they are likely experiencing anger, fear, or sadness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Sitting with them through their emotions and actively listening helps them feel supported and prevents them from feeling abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

### Becoming an "Agent" for Laid-Off Employees
To make employees feel valued even during a layoff, actively help them find their next job by acting as their "agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. This means proactively reaching out to contacts on their behalf to help them find a role where their skills and passions are truly needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. Even if they are not a top performer, they are likely good at *something* that another organization needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

### Supporting the "Stay Team"
After a layoff, the remaining "stay team" will also experience sadness, anger, and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>. Beyond an all-hands meeting, managers should conduct one-on-one meetings with each team member to allow them to express their thoughts and feelings about the layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. The manager's role is solely to listen and make them feel heard, using the reflection technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>. This empathetic approach helps accelerate the team's recovery and maintain morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

## Practical Implementation
To practice these techniques, it's recommended to utilize available resources such as detailed curriculum documents or scripts that outline step-by-step processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. Once someone experiences the positive impact of these methods, the successful outcome becomes its own motivation for continued practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.

Jason Fried, co-founder and CEO of 37signals (creators of Basecamp and HEY), champions a unique approach to [[the_importance_of_strategy_and_decisionmaking_in_product_leadership | business strategy]] and [[strategies_for_effective_decisionmaking | decision-making]] that prioritizes instinct, gut feeling, and simplicity over conventional metrics and aggressive growth targets. His company, 37signals, operates without investors or a board, has no plans to go public, and has been profitable for 24 consecutive years, generating tens of millions in profit annually with over 100,000 customers and a relatively small team of around 75 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## The Core Philosophy: Feeling Over Figures

Fried believes that the ultimate goal of a successful business is to make money, and entrepreneurs who start by bootstrapping gain more practice in this fundamental skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the common industry mantra of "go big or go home" and seeking unicorn status, a path few companies actually achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

At 37signals, success is deeply personal and experiential, centered on the question: "Would I want to do this again?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. If the answer is yes—if the work was enjoyable, worthwhile, and something worth repeating—then it was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

> "We just want to make more money than we spend, have good healthy margins which allow us to sort of experiment and play and not be afraid to do things that may not work and enjoy ourselves." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:32">[01:06:32]</a>

This philosophy translates into practical [[strategic_thinking_and_category_design_in_business | strategic thinking]] choices:
*   **Profit-driven, not Revenue-driven**: While many companies focus on revenue, 37signals prioritizes profit, believing that revenue alone can lead to bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>. They assess overall collective profitability rather than scrutinizing individual product P&Ls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>.
*   **No Arbitrary Targets**: The company avoids financial goals, OKRs, KPIs, or growth targets for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. Success is simply making more than they spend at year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.
*   **Intuition and Gut-driven [[strategies_for_effective_decisionmaking | Decision-Making]]**: Fried openly admits he doesn't know how to make decisions purely by numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:14">[01:44:14]</a>. He believes all human decisions are "judgment calls" influenced by countless known and unknown factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>. Key questions revolve around "how does this feel?" – applicable to screens, flows, features, words, colors, and even the overall website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:05">[01:48:05]</a>. This focus on feeling extends to asking employees, encouraging them to share their subjective opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:35">[01:48:35]</a>.

## Operationalizing Instinct: The Shape Up Methodology

This intuition-first approach is embedded in their product development framework, "Shape Up," which can be explored at basecamp.com/shapeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Appetites, Not Estimates**: Instead of estimating how long a project will take, they set an "appetite"—a fixed budget of time (e.g., one week, six weeks maximum) they are willing to spend on a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a>. This forces teams to find the simplest, most effective version of the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:33">[01:34:33]</a>.
*   **Small, Empowered Teams**: Projects are handled by a maximum of two people (one programmer, one designer) with a strict six-week deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. This avoids large meetings, slow decision-making, and complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.
*   **Fixed Cycles, Not Sprints**: They use "cycles" of work (typically six weeks) followed by a two-week "cool down" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:52">[01:42:52]</a>. This prevents burnout and allows for internal freelancing, bug fixes, or exploration of new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:14">[01:43:14]</a>. The term "Sprint" is avoided because it implies exhaustion and unsustainable intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Task Management**: Teams create their own tasks and to-dos to fulfill the shaped idea, rather than working from a pre-defined spec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:27">[01:35:27]</a>. They "trade concessions" and have open discussions when encountering unexpected challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:58">[01:35:58]</a>.
*   **Preventing Demoralization**: Projects that hit their time limit and are still "going up the hill" (i.e., not close to completion) are usually killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:10">[01:36:10]</a>. This prevents long, demoralizing projects that can lead to employee dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:11">[01:37:11]</a>.

## The Power of Constraints: Bootstrapping and Independence

A foundational element allowing this approach is 37signals' decision to bootstrap and maintain independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.
*   **Avoiding the "Outlier" Path**: While venture capital can be necessary for certain capital-intensive businesses (like car manufacturing or restaurants), software businesses are often cheap to start and have healthy margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>. However, Silicon Valley has ironically found ways to make the most profitable business type the least profitable, often due to over-hiring and excessive spending on customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.
*   **Freedom and Flexibility**: Bootstrapping means no investors, no board, no plans to go public, and no pressure to sell the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. This independence allows them to steer the company in any direction they choose, acting as an "all-terrain vehicle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.
*   **Fostering "Scrappiness"**: When companies receive abundant funding, it often leads to "sloppiness" because they don't *have* to be efficient or profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>. Bootstrapping forces entrepreneurs to learn how to make money and manage costs, teaching crucial [[experimentation_and_decisionmaking_in_business_growth | business growth]] skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.
*   **"Stay Ups" over "Startups"**: Fried prefers the term "stay up" to emphasize the long-term endurance required to maintain a business, which is harder than merely starting one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>.

## "Work Isn't War"

37signals actively rejects common business metaphors that evoke conflict, such as "conquer the market," "target customers," or "destroy the competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. Fried finds this language depressing and prefers words that foster a spirit of creation and pride in making something great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. This [[psychology_in_marketing_and_decision_making | psychological]] approach aligns with their overall desire for a fulfilling and enjoyable work experience.

## Hiring for Intuition

When hiring designers and product people, Fried looks for "taste" and asks about their admiration for other products or creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:08">[01:51:08]</a>. During the interview process, candidates complete a paid project, and during the critique, Fried pushes back and asks, "If you had another couple days, what would you do with this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:57">[01:51:57]</a>. This reveals their raw gut instincts, their ability to "riff on the spot," and whether their gut is "filled with ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:06">[01:52:06]</a>. While ideas are important, the ability to execute a clever design thoughtfully and clearly is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:06">[01:54:06]</a>.

## A Continuous Evolution: The "Once" Product Line

Jason Fried acknowledged a significant shift in his own thinking: he initially believed he would be content working on Basecamp for the rest of his career, constantly refining one product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:30">[02:00:30]</a>. However, the desire to "make more things" led to the creation of HEY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>, and now a new product line called "Once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:48">[02:01:48]</a>.

Once products are a deliberate departure from the SaaS model, allowing customers to pay once for software to download and install on their own servers, with no recurring subscription fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:32">[02:24:32]</a>. This re-exploration of an older software distribution model is fueled by:
*   **Subscription Fatigue**: A belief that users are tired of endless monthly payments for products that don't fundamentally change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:56">[02:23:56]</a>.
*   **Commodity Markets**: Identifying business software commodities that are still charging "luxury prices" despite numerous alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:50">[02:25:50]</a>.
*   **Simplicity and Core Functionality**: Building "beautifully tight, simple, essential generics" that get the "80/20" core right at high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:53">[02:25:53]</a>.
*   **Empowering Users**: Providing the code for users to modify and tweak the software themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:57">[02:28:57]</a>.
*   **Creative Exploration**: The Once model provides an opportunity to "play and explore new realms and new ideas" that are not feasible within the SaaS framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:35">[02:30:35]</a>.

The first Once product will be a relaunch of Campfire, an early group chat tool created by 37signals in 2006, years before Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:46">[02:26:46]</a>. This new version will offer 90% of the functionality of modern chat tools in a simple, self-hosted package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>. It will also feature minimal words to be globally accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:41">[02:29:41]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

For those looking to adopt a similar path, Fried offers simple advice:
*   **Stay Small**: Keep costs incredibly low and figure out how to do as much as possible on your own before hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:11">[02:12:11]</a>.
*   **Control Costs**: Focus on what you can control – your expenses – as external factors like market, competition, or economy are beyond your influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:19">[02:12:19]</a>.
*   **Embrace Simplicity**: Avoid over-complicating things, as this often leads to greater difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:52">[02:13:52]</a>.
*   **Practice Making Money**: Bootstrapping forces continuous practice in generating profit, a critical skill often overlooked by heavily funded companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:47">[02:18:47]</a>.
*   **"Worry Less"**: Much anxiety stems from anticipating future problems that never materialize. Focus on the present and be at peace with potential negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:21">[02:44:21]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Instincts**: Embrace intuition and gut feeling, especially when dealing with complex, non-mechanistic systems like software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:31">[02:45:31]</a>. Innovation often comes from not knowing "how you're supposed to do it" and relying on inner guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:48">[02:47:48]</a>.

The overall [[strategy_and_its_four_critical_choices | business strategy]] at 37signals is to "keep making great, keep your costs in check, charge appropriate prices for your work, share as much as you can, and let the chips fall where they may" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:10">[02:22:10]</a>.

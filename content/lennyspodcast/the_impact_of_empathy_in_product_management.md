Empathy is a foundational element for successful product management, extending beyond mere kindness to become a critical, non-optional aspect of creating products for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. For product managers, understanding and incorporating empathy means shifting focus from internal validation to external user delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Defining Empathy in Product Management
According to Seth Godin, [[the_role_of_empathy_and_user_feedback_in_product_management | empathy]] in product management is not about being "kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Instead, it is about:
*   **Understanding the User's Perspective** The core of empathy is designing a product for other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. This means anticipating what users want just before they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Taking Responsibility for User Experience** If a user struggles with a product, such as needing to "read the manual" (RTFM), it indicates a mistake by the product creator, not the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   **Focusing on User Delight** The true measure of quality is whether the intended user is delighted with the shipped product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This satisfaction should be the primary standard, not pleasing a boss or adhering to internal excuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Empathy in Practice
Seth Godin, who began his career as a product manager, highlighted how this user-centric approach guided his early work at Spinnaker Software, a company that developed educational computer games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. His team's aim was to delight the software buyer, maintaining "untouchable" standards focused on user satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This dedication led to their products consistently performing well, with five titles going "gold" and saving the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

### Empathy and Product Promises
For all companies, especially those leveraging [[impact_and_challenges_of_ai_in_product_management | AI]], the goal is to articulate "what's in this for the user" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This involves making a "difficult" or "remarkable" promise and then consistently keeping it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Breaking a promise even once can damage a brand's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

An example of this is the comparison between ChatGPT and Claude:
*   **Claude:** Builds a brand by being clear about its limitations and exhibiting "kindness and humility" when it doesn't know an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. This approach earns user trust and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT:** Its reputation suffers from regularly "overpromis[ing] and underdeliver[ing]" without humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, making it a tool of last resort for some users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

### Empathy in Leadership
In leadership, painting a picture of the future must be "based in [[empathy_in_storytelling_and_communication | empathy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. True leadership means understanding "where they want to go" (the audience/users), rather than imposing one's own vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. Professionals, therefore, operate from a "non-narcissism" standpoint, striving to be of service by enabling people to achieve their existing desires, rather than trying to change what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

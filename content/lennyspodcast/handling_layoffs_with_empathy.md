The distinction between a botched and a successful layoff often hinges on how the news is delivered to the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A successful layoff involves the person hearing the news directly from their manager in a one-on-one setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Conversely, hearing about a layoff via email, group chat, or while sitting next to others is considered "terrible" and dehumanizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This impersonal approach often leads to intense anger and public backlash on platforms like Twitter and in newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, as it prevents individuals from expressing their emotions in a private setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Importance of Humane Layoffs

[[hiring_and_firing_in_startup_teams | Learning to fire people]] effectively is considered one of the most crucial skills for a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Managers often struggle with this due to the misconception that they are hurting the person being let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. Concerns about an employee's personal situation or need for the job often deter managers from making the necessary decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

### Decision vs. Implementation

Wee Dang, CEO of Clipboard Health, offers a framework for making difficult decisions, which involves separating the decision itself from its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. In a company context, the decision should prioritize the customer's needs, which typically means having the best employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. The implementation then focuses on how to mitigate the pain caused to affected individuals, including the employee, the manager, and the remaining team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

### The "Agent" Approach

A key aspect of a humane layoff is actively helping the person find their next role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. This means becoming their "agent," proactively reaching out to contacts and recommending them for suitable positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. The belief is that every person is "good at something" and passionate about it, and the goal is to help them find a place where those skills and passions are truly needed and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. This active support ensures the individual feels appreciated, even if the initial news is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.

### The Unexpected Benefits of Layoffs

Counterintuitively, companies often operate *better* after layoffs, even on an absolute scale, producing more features and code with improved NPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. This is because every additional person in an organization increases overhead, friction in information flow, and potential morale problems, which grow geometrically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Reducing headcount can streamline operations and increase efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>. Companies that cut deep in layoffs tend to perform better within 60 days, or even two weeks if the process is handled with extreme empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. Cutting deep also means only cutting once, preventing "PTSD" or repeated trauma within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

## Tactical Steps for a Humane Layoff

The process for conducting a layoff humanely involves several key steps:

1.  **Individual Notification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>:
    *   **Preparation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>: Begin by informing the person that the conversation will be difficult and they may not enjoy it, allowing them a few seconds to mentally prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. This forewarning can prevent the amygdala from being triggered as hard by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
    *   **Delivery** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>: Clearly state the news: "I'm letting you go," followed by the reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
    *   **Emotional Release** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>: Acknowledge that they are likely feeling [[managing_fear_and_anger_for_better_leadership | anger]], [[managing_fear_and_anger_for_better_leadership | fear]], or sadness, and invite them to share their feelings and thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. This allows for emotional release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.
    *   **Active Listening** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>: Actively listen and make them feel heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. This shows the manager is not trying to avoid their pain but is willing to sit with them through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
    *   **Offer Agent Support** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>: Offer to be their "agent" and schedule a follow-up meeting specifically to help them find their next job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. This active support, rather than passive offers, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

2.  **Managerial Preparation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>:
    *   Include all managers in an inner circle to determine the necessary cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.
    *   Assign a specific dollar amount for cost savings to each manager, rather than a number of people, to ensure they prioritize valuable roles over simply the cheapest ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.
    *   Allow each manager to choose who to let go within their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>.

3.  **Communication with the "Stay Team"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>:
    *   **All-Hands Meeting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>: Hold an all-hands meeting for the remaining team to explain what happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.
    *   **Address Concerns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>: Proactively address common fears, such as "Is this going to happen to me?" or "Does this mean the company is dying?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. Reassure them that the cut was deep and that they are the core team going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.
    *   **Individual One-on-Ones** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>: Within two weeks of the layoff, each manager should conduct a one-hour one-on-one with every person on their stay team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>. The sole purpose is to listen to their thoughts and feelings, and make them feel heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>. This process reduces negative emotions, accelerates recovery, and helps maintain morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.

### Making People Feel Heard

To truly make someone feel heard, especially during difficult conversations:
*   **Verbal Repetition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>: Repeat back what you understood them to say until they confirm you got it right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
*   **Reflecting Underlying Thoughts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>: Go deeper by reflecting back what you imagine their unstated thoughts or emotions might be, even if they are stronger than what was verbally expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. This demonstrates a true understanding of their perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.

Even if handled poorly, a company will eventually perform better two months post-layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>, though the team's emotional recovery might take longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>. The key to a quicker recovery and improved performance lies in the humane and transparent implementation of the layoff process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

Michael Tru, co-founder and CEO of Any Sphere, the company behind Cursor, discusses the vision and process of [[building_web_products_with_ai_tools | building]] and scaling AI-enabled tools, specifically focusing on the AI code editor, Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Cursor aims to invent a new type of programming, moving towards a world "after code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Vision: Programming After Code

The core goal with Cursor is to invent a new, very different way to build software that goes beyond traditional coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This future involves specifying intent to the computer in the most concise way possible, focusing on how the software should work and look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The belief is that current technology, as it matures, can lead to methods of [[role_of_ai_in_enhancing_and_transforming_software_development | building software]] that are "legions higher level and more productive," and in some cases, more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Michael Tru contrasts this vision with two common alternative perspectives:
*   **Software building remains primarily text editing** formal programming languages like TypeScript or Go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **A chatbot-style interaction** where users type requests into a bot to build or change software, similar to talking to an engineering department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

The chatbot approach lacks precision; humans need more precise ways to gesture at changes than a text box removed from the actual application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The "after code" world envisions software logic represented in a more human-readable form, like an evolution of programming language towards pseudocode or a doctrine form, which is much "turser and easier to navigate" than millions of lines of impenetrable code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Evolving Engineer Skills
In this future, being an engineer will feel more like being a "logic designer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The key skill will be "taste" – having the right idea for what should be built and how it should work, with the AI handling the underlying "how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This means less focus on carefulness in coding and more on defining the intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This concept relates to "vibe coding," where one generates code without understanding all the details, though current vibe coding has limitations as it can lead to unwieldy software that is hard to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. The goal is to give users continued control even when not understanding every detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## Origin Story of Cursor
Cursor began as a "solution search of a problem," reflecting on how AI would improve over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Two key moments spurred its creation:
1.  **First Beta of GitHub Copilot**: This was the first truly useful AI product the founders had experienced, proving to be one of the most valuable dev tools they had ever adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
2.  **OpenAI Scaling Papers**: These papers demonstrated that AI would continuously improve simply by scaling models and data, even without new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

In late 2021/early 2022, realizing that AI products were now possible, the founders noticed that while many were focused on building models, few were deeply considering how AI would transform specific areas of knowledge work like software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Initial Misstep and Pivot
Initially, the team made a "misstep" by deciding to work in an area they thought would be "uncompetitive and sleepy" – automating mechanical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This presented challenges:
*   Lack of founder expertise in mechanical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   Difficulty in making existing AI models useful for mechanical engineering, requiring immediate custom model development due to scarce data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

After four months, they pivoted back to programming, realizing that despite some existing tools, there wasn't enough ambition to fundamentally change how software was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

### The IDE Path
The decision to build a full IDE (Integrated Development Environment) rather than just a plugin or a standalone model was driven by the belief that:
*   **Humans must remain in the driver's seat**: Unlike projects aiming for full end-to-end AI automation, Cursor prioritizes giving humans control over all decisions in the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. This "dogfooding" approach of using the tool intensely internally instilled realism about AI's current limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
*   **Programming form factor will change drastically**: Existing coding environments offer limited extensibility, and significant changes to the UI and how programming is done necessitate control over the entire application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

The vision for the IDE is that it will evolve to allow seamless transitions between foreground work and background AI agents, including those interacting via Slack or issue trackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. The goal is to move towards a state where engineers manage AI "reports" by chopping up tasks into smaller, reviewable bits, avoiding the "recipe for disaster" of large, unsupervised AI work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

## Growth and Success of Cursor
Cursor achieved historic growth, reaching $100 million ARR in 20 months and $300 million ARR in just 2 years since launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. The growth has been a consistent exponential curve, which initially felt slow due to low starting numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

Key factors contributing to Cursor's success:
*   **Rapid Iteration and "Build in Public"**: The first version of Cursor was hand-rolled from scratch in about three months, prioritizing getting it into users' hands quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Initial user feedback, including the "immediate crush of interest," led to pivotal changes like switching to a VS Code base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
*   **Sustained Paranoia about Improvement**: Success is attributed to continuous evolution and making the tool consistently better, always feeling "very very far away" from the end goal of inventing a new form of programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.
*   **Product-Led Growth**: The focus was entirely on [[using_ai_tools_for_product_management_and_development | building a great product]] that the team loved and adjusting it based on user feedback, rather than traditional sales and marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
*   **Interdisciplinary Product Building**: AI product development requires combining a traditional software company's focus on user experience with a foundation model company's need to innovate on the science and model side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.

## Counterintuitive Lessons from Building Cursor
One of the most counterintuitive lessons was the **necessity of internal model development** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Initially, the team believed they could leverage existing foundation models due to the immense cost of training models like GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>. However, it became clear that "every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

Cursor employs an "ensemble of models" approach, combining large foundation models (like Sonnet, Gemini, GPT) with specialized custom models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. Custom models are used for:
*   **Speed and Cost-Efficiency**: For tasks like autocomplete, where predictions need to be delivered within 300 milliseconds and run on "tons and tons and tons of molecules" (requests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>. Code is unique because future work is often predictable (e.g., changing related files after editing one part), unlike writing where it's less clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.
*   **Specialty Use Cases**: Models trained specifically for autocompleting a series of "diffs" (changes, additions, deletions) in a codebase, rather than just generic text sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.
*   **Input and Output Processing for Foundation Models**:
    *   **Input**: Custom models act as "mini Google search" within a codebase to find relevant parts to show big models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.
    *   **Output**: Smaller, incredibly fast custom models take the high-level "sketches" of changes from big models and "fill in the details," turning them into full code diffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

These custom models often start from the best open-source pre-trained models, with tuning and post-training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

## Defensibility and Market Dynamics in AI
In the AI space, defensibility is less about traditional moats like lock-in and more about **continuous innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. The "ceiling is so high" that any "entrenchment you build" can be leapfrogged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. This market resembles early search engines (late 90s/early 2000s) or the development of personal computers, where:
*   The ceiling for improvement is incredibly high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
*   Users can easily switch to a better product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.
*   Value can be continuously gained from R&D investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   Distribution helps tune algorithms based on user data and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.

Michael believes the market for tools for programmers and knowledge workers is "really really big," much larger than in the past, because there is "so much more you can do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. While there might be many solutions for niches, he predicts **one generational winner** that builds the "general tool that builds almost all the world's software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.

Incumbents like Microsoft (with Copilot) struggle in this market because it's not friendly to companies whose ROI for innovation is small, or where switching is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. This market favors the most innovative product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>.

## Tips for New Cursor Users and Working with AI Tools
To be successful with Cursor, users need to develop a "taste" for what the models can do, their complexity limits, and how much they need to specify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.
*   **Chop tasks into smaller bits**: Instead of attempting one large specification, break tasks into smaller parts, specifying a little, getting some work done, then specifying more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>.
*   **Experiment in safe environments**: Developers should explicitly try to find the limits of AI models by being ambitious in side projects, as many underestimate AI's abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. This helps build a "gut feeling" for how far the model can take an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

## [[impact_of_ai_on_developer_productivity | Impact of AI on Engineers]] and Roles
AI tools like Cursor benefit both junior and senior engineers, though they exhibit different "anti-patterns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>:
*   **Junior Engineers**: Tend to rely "a little too wholesale" on AI, which is not yet feasible for complex professional work in large codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.
*   **Senior Engineers**: Often "underrate what AI can do for them" and stick to existing workflows, although developer experience teams often comprise senior engineers actively pushing AI adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

Despite AI's capabilities, there will be *more* demand for engineers in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. Engineers will be able to accomplish much more, and the demand for software is "very lasting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>. The current cost and labor intensity of [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development_and_deployment | building software]] creates friction, and if that can be reduced by orders of magnitude, there will be "tons and tons and tons of more stuff that we could do our computers, tons more tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.

## Staying Focused in a Rapidly Evolving Field
In a field with constant innovation and "chatter," staying focused is crucial. Cursor achieves this by:
*   **Strategic Hiring**: Recruiting people with the "right disposition" – less focused on external validation, more on building great products, and possessing a "level levelheaded" attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.
*   **Building an "Immune System"**: The team, having witnessed many technological comings and goings since 2021/2022 (e.g., the rise of GPT-3 Instruct, Dall-E, Stable Diffusion, GPT-4, video models), has learned to discern which events truly impact the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>.

## Overall Misconceptions About AI
People often misunderstand the trajectory of AI by falling to either extreme: expecting it to happen very fast, or dismissing it as "bluster and hype" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>. Michael believes:
*   AI represents an "incredibly consequential" technology shift, more significant than the internet or the advent of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.
*   This shift will be a "multi-decade thing," taking a while to unfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.
*   Progress requires knocking down independent problems in both the science (making models smarter, faster, cheaper, adaptable to modalities, taking real-world actions) and the human experience (how humans interact with and control these systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   Companies that build both the underlying technology and the product experience for specific areas of knowledge work will be "really really really consequential," driving innovation and potentially building "very very big businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.

## [[creating_aipowered_product_teams | Hiring at Cursor]]
Cursor is currently a relatively small company (around 60 people, with a high percentage of engineers, researchers, and designers) given its scale and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. The team plans to grow significantly to continue improving the product and service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.

A key learning in hiring was that initially, they "hired too slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. They focused on attracting "world-class engineers and researchers" who possess both intellectual curiosity for experimentation and intellectual honesty/micro-pessimism for navigating the noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

A distinctive part of their interview process is a **two-day on-site work test** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. Candidates work on a real, mini-project within Cursor's codebase (though not shipped code) largely unsupervised, with opportunities for collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. This allows the team to see a real work product and assess cultural fit over two days, making it the "ultimate interview question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>.

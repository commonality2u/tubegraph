Whiz, a cloud security company, achieved remarkable growth, hitting $100 million ARR just 18 months after its founding, making it the fastest-growing software company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. However, this success followed a period of significant uncertainty and a crucial product pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Ros Herberg, Chief Marketing Officer and VP of Product Strategy at Whiz, joined as the first product manager when the founders were still figuring out their idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Initial Idea and Signals of Failure
The company initially began as "Beyond Networks," focusing on network security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:43">[07:33:43]</a>. Despite the founding team's strong background in cloud security, they deliberately chose to explore network security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

### Customer Interactions Without Clarity
In the early weeks, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when many people were home, Whiz engaged in 10 to 15 meetings daily with potential customers (CISOs, security owners for entire companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Even without a solid product, they presented their idea using a deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

The customers' responses were consistently polite and positive: "Oh, it sounds interesting," "Sounds interesting, would love to hear more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. While this felt good, Ros, as the first product manager, realized after a couple of weeks that she still didn't understand what they were going to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

### The "I Don't Understand" Moment
This lack of clarity led Ros to confront the team, asking "What exactly are we doing here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. She initially thought she was the only one who didn't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. This question triggered a deep discussion, revealing that their broad story wasn't clear, and customers were not incentivized to challenge them or dig deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

Ros notes that people, by nature, have a bias to look for affirmation rather than for what they don't want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. This highlighted a [[common_challenges_faced_by_product_teams_and_how_to_overcome_them | challenge]] in how they were listening to customer feedback, focusing on positive reinforcement instead of signs of deep enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

## Pivoting to Product-Market Fit
The realization led to a five-hour discussion among the founders, resulting in a pivot to cloud security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>. This was a domain the team knew best from their backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.

### Signals of Product-Market Fit
Once they pivoted to cloud security, the customer conversations changed dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. The shift was "so easy to distinguish" from the wrong path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>. Customers began asking specific questions:
*   "How are you pricing this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>
*   "When can we start doing a POV (Proof of Value)?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>
*   "I know exactly who I need to connect you to in my team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>

These were "really strong indications" of genuine interest, showing that customers wanted to take the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>. It was no longer just "Oh, super cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.

### The Power of "Pull" from Customers
A key [[signs_of_being_stuck_at_a_productmarket_fit_stage_and_how_to_pivot | sign of product-market fit]] was when a Fortune 10 company wanted to start a POV. Despite Whiz having only a nascent product and needing to buy time, they sent a long list of technical questions to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>. Ros feared this would scare them away, but the list came back filled a day later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>. This demonstrated immense customer commitment and "pull" for the product, even in its early, unrefined state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>. This was a crucial lesson: "don't be too afraid to get the pull from the customer," as it indicates true commitment for a journey they take together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:50]</a>.

## Lessons from Early Sales and Founder Involvement
Whiz experienced rapid growth, leading to selling before they even had a sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. The founders, including Ros, closed deals and learned the sales process firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>. This provided valuable experience and confidence when they later hired their first salesperson, demonstrating that the product could indeed be sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>.

A significant [[challenges_and_strategies_for_earlystage_b2b_startups | lesson for early-stage startups]] is that founders should avoid the "wish" of hiring someone to solve a problem they can't do themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. If the core group cannot achieve something, bringing in an outsider to solve the problem is often "wishful" and rarely works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. This applies to sales, marketing, and product clarity.

## Culture and Mindset for Navigating Challenges
The culture at Whiz, particularly among the founding team, is characterized by its flatness and openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>. This enabled Ros to voice her confusion early on without fear of judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. The founders fostered an environment where impact is valued above seniority, and voices are heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>.

### Embracing "I Don't Understand"
Ros's favorite question has become "I don't understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. She believes that if something is not easy to understand, "then maybe it needs a bit more chewing on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>. This reflects a core principle: "We may be wrong, but we're not confused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.

### Being Okay with Failure
A crucial aspect of Ros's approach and a valuable lesson for [[overcoming_startup_failures_and_challenges | startup challenges]] is being comfortable with the possibility of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>. She often goes into new roles or initiatives expecting to fail but attempts them anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a>. This "allows yourself to be more vulnerable" and releases the pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:54:00">[41:54:00]</a>. This mindset was instilled by her mother, who believed in pushing through areas of less confidence and that "friction is good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:19:00">[43:19:00]</a>.

### Clear Communication (The "Dummy Explanation")
From her transition to marketing, Ros learned the [[challenges_and_strategies_in_product_management | criticality of clear communication]] for scaling a message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>. Product teams often work with "fluffy or blurry or like gray" concepts, but when scaling, messages must be "Crystal Clear black and white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:04:00">[46:04:00]</a>.

Ros emphasizes the "dummy explanation" concept: ensuring that every single thing written or said by Whiz is understandable by anyone, without assuming deep knowledge about the company, product, or market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:12:00">[49:12:00]</a>. This means avoiding complex terminology or industry-specific acronyms that might be common within the "Whiz bubble" but not among customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>. Constant self-reminders about being in an internal bubble are essential for effective external communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:00">[50:47:00]</a>.

These insights highlight that [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth | navigating early startup growth]] involves not only finding the right product but also cultivating a culture of honest feedback, embracing experimentation, and prioritizing clear, customer-centric communication.

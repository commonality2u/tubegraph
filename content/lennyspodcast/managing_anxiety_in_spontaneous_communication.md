Matt Abrahams, a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and host of the *Think Fast, Talk Smart* podcast, shares techniques for improving communication skills, particularly in spontaneous speaking situations, and for [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | reducing anxiety]] associated with public speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Effective speaking is described as a "superpower" for career advancement, including interviewing, meetings, pitching ideas, and leading teams, becoming even more crucial as one grows professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | Managing Anxiety]]

Anxiety before and during public speaking is a common experience, described as an innate human condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Many effective communicators also experience nervousness, which is often not visible to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The goal is to reduce nervousness over time through consistent application of techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

Techniques to [[strategies_for_effective_public_speaking_and_reducing_nervousness | calm anxiety]] include:

*   **Visualization and Desensitization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:
    *   Picture yourself successfully navigating the entire speaking event, from getting on stage to stepping off, and the audience responding positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   This "dress rehearsal" in your mind helps to [[visualization_and_desensitization_techniques_for_public_speaking | desensitize]] you to the situation, making it feel less new or novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
    *   It can be done in 5 minutes, ideally a couple of times, combined with deep breathing to calm the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
    *   Virtual reality (VR) tools can also be used for desensitization by simulating different audience sizes and responsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **"Dare to Be Dull" / Strive for Connection over Perfection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>:
    *   Reduce self-imposed pressure to be perfect, funny, or the most interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
    *   Focus on just getting the task done â€“ answer the question, give the feedback, engage in the small talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
    *   This dials down self-evaluation, freeing up cognitive resources to connect with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
    *   Paradoxically, removing the pressure often leads to better and more insightful communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Reframing (Excitement vs. Anxiety)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>:
    *   The physiological arousal for anxiety (e.g., faster heart rate, shakiness) is similar to excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
    *   Consciously label these symptoms as excitement ("I'm excited to share my point of view") rather than negative anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
    *   This positive reframing can lead to relaxation and improved communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Mantras** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>:
    *   Use short, positive affirmations to counteract negative self-talk (e.g., "I have value to bring," "You've got this," "I'm prepared") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
    *   Writing it on a Post-it note or setting phone reminders can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
    *   Examples include "Last time this went well" or "It's not about me, it's about my content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   **Normalizing Anxiety**:
    *   Understand that feeling nervous is common and innate to being human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
    *   Recognizing that others also experience anxiety can reduce self-imposed pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **Framing as Conversation**:
    *   Many people are more comfortable in conversation than presenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
    *   Set up communication situations, even presentations, as conversations (e.g., "Today I have three questions I'd like to answer...") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Distraction Techniques** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>:
    *   Shift the audience's attention away from you at the start of a talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
    *   This could involve asking a question, telling a story, showing a video, or asking them to read something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
    *   This gives you time to get comfortable, especially during the most nervous moments (one minute before and the first minute of speaking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Breathing Techniques** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>:
    *   Deep belly breathing slows heart rate, stabilizes voice, and reduces shakiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
    *   The "double inhalation" involves inhaling fully, then sneaking in a little extra air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
    *   Crucially, the exhale should be longer than the inhale (e.g., twice as long), as the relaxation response happens during the exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
    *   This grounds you in the present and prevents catastrophizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Getting Present Oriented** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>:
    *   Anxiety often stems from fear of future negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
    *   Engaging in activities that force present focus, like saying tongue twisters aloud, helps warm up the voice and center your mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Swearing (Research-Backed)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>:
    *   Research suggests that swearing can release neurochemicals that blunt anxiety-associated neurochemicals (like cortisol), providing a dopamine and serotonin hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. This is meant to be done privately, not publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

## Speaking On The Spot

Most public speaking is spontaneous, not planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. Anyone can improve at spontaneous speaking, but it requires preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Just like athletes train to be spontaneous in their sport, communicators must practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. Improvement involves addressing both mindset and the approach to messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Structure

When speaking spontaneously, people often "spew out" information in lists, which brains are not wired to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Structure provides a logical beginning, middle, and end, making information digestible and memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. It removes the burden of figuring out *how* to say something, allowing focus on *what* to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

Common structures include:

*   **Problem-Solution-Benefit**: Common in advertising, it presents a problem, how it's solved, and the benefits of the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
*   **PREP (Point, Reason, Example, Point)**: State your point, give a reason, provide an example, then restate your point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
*   **What, So What, Now What**:
    *   **What**: Describe the topic (product, service, update, feedback) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
    *   **So What**: Explain its importance or relevance to the audience or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Now What**: Outline next steps or implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.
    *   This is useful for product teams describing features or giving stand-up updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

To remember structures, use catchy names and, most importantly, put them into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Actively dissect communication you hear or read, identifying the structures used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. Improvement comes through repetition, reflection, and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

### Resources for Practice

*   **Toastmasters**: A great organization for gaining practice ("reps") in public speaking, including specific exercises for spontaneous speaking called "table topics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   **Improvisation Classes**: Helps develop comfort with being present, collaborative, and spontaneous, rather than just being funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
*   **University Extension/Continuing Studies Classes**: Many universities offer communication classes open to the public, sometimes virtually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
*   **"Try This" Exercises**: Books on communication often include exercises to apply concepts immediately, which is crucial for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

### Specific Spontaneous Communication Situations

#### Small Talk

[[improving_small_talk_and_conversational_skills | Small talk]] often has a bad reputation but is vital for forming and fostering relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.

*   **Mindset**: Be interested, not interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. Focus on setting the other person up for success, rather than trying to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
*   **Balance of Disclosure**: Maintain a comparable level of disclosure or depth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. If one person shares something personal, the other should eventually reciprocate at a similar level to avoid awkwardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. Avoid disclosing too much too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.
*   **Supporting vs. Shifting Responses**:
    *   **Supporting**: Ask questions that encourage the other person to continue sharing (e.g., "Did you spend time in San Jose?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Shifting**: Redirect the conversation to yourself (e.g., "Oh, you went to Costa Rica? I went to Hawaii.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
    *   A good conversation has more supporting than shifting responses, but some shifting is needed to show you're willing to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

#### Giving Feedback

[[managing_different_types_of_problematic_behavior_at_work | Feedback]] should be viewed as an opportunity to problem-solve collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

*   **Avoid Pet Peeves**: Do not say "Good question" to every question or "Does that make sense?" at the end of every answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. These can sound disingenuous or imply a lack of clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   **Structure: What, So What, Now What**: Applied to feedback, this means stating the behavior observed ("What"), explaining its impact or consequence ("So What"), and suggesting a concrete next step or solution ("Now What") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
*   **Four I's Structure**:
    *   **Information**: Set the context and describe the specific behavior or event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Impact**: Explain the impact the behavior had on you, the giver of feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Invitation**: Collaborate by inviting the person to discuss or suggest solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Implications**: Discuss the broader consequences or benefits of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

#### Giving Toasts and Tributes

Toasts are frequent public speaking events and include congratulatory speeches at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

*   **Be Brief**: Nobody complains about a toast being too short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.
*   **Structure: WHAT**:
    *   **W**hy are we here: Briefly state the purpose of the gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.
    *   **H**ow are you connected: Explain your relationship to the person or event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.
    *   **A**necdote: Share a relevant, concise, and accessible story or example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. This is where the main content and emotion are conveyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
    *   **T**hanks: Express gratitude or give a final toast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.
*   **Be Emotional (Show, Don't Tell)**: Genuine emotion connects with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. Convey emotion through anecdotes rather than stating feelings directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
*   **Minimally Viable Communication**: Prototype your toast by running it by a few people to get feedback before the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

#### Q&A Sessions

View Q&A as an opportunity to extend, expand, connect, and learn, even in challenging situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

*   **Avoid Pet Peeves**: Do not say "Good question" or "Does that make sense?" repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. Instead, ask "Did I answer your question?" or "Can I tell you more?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.
*   **Structure: ADD (Answer, Detailed Example, Describe Relevance)**:
    *   **Answer**: Provide a clear and concise response to the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Detailed Example**: Offer a concrete example to reinforce your answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Describe Relevance**: Explain why the answer is important or relevant to the audience, connecting the dots for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.
    *   This structure can be applied to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to build consistency in organizational communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

#### Apologizing

Take the time to apologize meaningfully, focusing on the transgression, not just how it made someone feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

*   **Structure: AAA (Acknowledge, Appreciate, Amend)**:
    *   **Acknowledge**: State exactly what you did wrong (e.g., "I'm very sorry for interrupting what you were saying") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Appreciate**: Show understanding of the difficulty or negative impact caused (e.g., "I can imagine my doing that made you feel bad") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Amend**: Propose a specific action to remedy the situation or prevent it from happening again (e.g., "Next time, I will wait until you're done and paraphrase what you said before I contribute") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.

### Key Takeaways for Communication Improvement

*   **Practice**: The only way to get better is through repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   **Reflection**: Think about what worked and what didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   **Feedback**: Get feedback from others, as you are not always the best judge of your own communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Compassion**: Improvement takes time, so be patient and kind to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Improving communication not only helps you but also helps others by effectively sharing your voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.

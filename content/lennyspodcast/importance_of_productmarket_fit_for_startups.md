## Defining Product-Market Fit
For Linear, [[the_concept_of_productmarket_fit_and_its_evolution | product-market fit]] is viewed as a spectrum rather than a binary state of "having it" or "not having it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. It involves continually asking whether the fit exists within specific market segments and how strong that fit is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.

### Early Stage Focus
In its early stages, Linear concentrated on achieving [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_a_b2b_company | product-market fit]] within the early-stage startup segment, aiming to become the default tool for these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>. After establishing a strong fit there, the focus shifted to enhancing [[product_market_fit_strategy | product-market fit]] for larger companies with hundreds or thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.

## Building Product-Market Fit at Linear
Linear's journey to [[the_concept_of_productmarket_fit_and_its_evolution | product-market fit]] involved specific strategies:

### Initial User Acquisition
Linear started officially working on the company in April 2019, announcing it publicly that month with a waitlist website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>. By May, the founders were using the product internally, and by June, friends and people from the waitlist were invited, leading to about 100-200 users and approximately 10 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>.

### Strategic Private Beta
Linear operated in a private beta stage for almost a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. The waitlist included survey questions about current tools, reasons for interest in Linear, and company size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. Invitations were selective, prioritizing smaller companies using supported tools and those showing genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>.

Initially, the process was manual, with Ki Sarin personally reviewing surveys, copying emails, and sending invite links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a>. The team invited users in cohorts (e.g., 10 people per week) to prevent overwhelming feedback on the same issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>. This allowed them to fix problems identified by one cohort before inviting the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>. This method proved effective for initial development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.

### Gathering Early Customer Feedback
The first 10 companies using Linear were a mix of friends' startups and early users from the waitlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>. During the private beta, pricing was not implemented, but a payment function with an optional sliding scale was introduced to test functionality and gauge user willingness to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. This provided confidence that a market existed for a paid product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.

### Feeling Product-Market Fit
Linear started to feel [[the_concept_of_productmarket_fit_and_its_evolution | product-market fit]] very early on when entire companies adopted the tool, showed increased happiness, and provided positive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. This initial fit was strongest with smaller, early-stage companies whose founders valued speed and shared similar product values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

For B2B companies, [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_a_b2b_company | product-market fit]] is segmented by customer size, domain, and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. If a product performs well in one category, it's advisable to double down on that success until that segment is well-captured before expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>. For example, Linear has observed success with AI companies (and previously crypto companies) and considers how to onboard more of these specific user types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>.

## Customer-Centric Approach
Linear operates as a "retention business" and "trust business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. The goal is for companies to start using Linear early and remain customers indefinitely, which necessitates continuously delivering a high-quality product and maintaining trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. This approach prioritizes respecting the customer over solely driving revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

The entire team engages in [[importance_of_talking_to_customers_in_startups | customer discovery methods]], with founders and team members regularly holding weekly calls with customers, engaging in shared Slack channels, and answering user questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. This ensures a deep understanding of customer problems and empathy across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. This broad understanding allows the team to make informed decisions based on intuition rather than relying solely on data or metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.

Marily Nika, a Product Lead at Meta and instructor of a popular course on [[AI in Product Development | AI]] and product management, discusses the evolving [[Role of Product Management in the AI Era | role of product management]] in the age of [[AI in Product Development | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. She emphasizes that while [[AI in Product Development | AI]] offers significant advancements, product managers must approach its implementation strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The "Shiny Object Trap" of [[AI in Product Development | AI]]
Marily Nika warns against the "shiny object trap," advising against implementing [[AI in Product Development | AI]] for its own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Instead, the focus should always be on identifying a specific problem or pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Once the problem and a high-level solution are clear, then one can explore how to implement [[AI in Product Development | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

> "Don't do [[AI in Product Development | AI]] for the sake of doing [[AI in Product Development | AI]]. Make sure there is a problem there, make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>

## Current [[Leveraging AI tools in product management | AI Tools]] for Product Managers
[[Leveraging AI tools in product management | AI tools]] are already helping product managers perform their jobs better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Marily Nika personally uses ChatGPT daily for various tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>:
*   **Crafting Mission Statements** ChatGPT can rewrite mission statements to be more engaging and understandable for all disciplines, from leadership to junior staff and competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Creating User Segments** It can generate user segments that a human might not consider, complete with motivations and pain points, sparking new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. For instance, prompting for potential users of a screen-less fitness band could yield diverse segments like young professionals with limited time or those who dislike daily charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Generating [[AI in Product Development | AI]]-Enhanced Ideas** It helps in brainstorming ideas that leverage [[AI in Product Development | AI]] capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## The [[ai_product_management_and_its_future | Future of AI in Product Management]]
Nika believes that in the future, every product manager will be an [[ai_powered_product_management_skills | AI product manager]] because [[AI in Product Development | AI]] will be integrated into everything by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This shift is driven by the need for personalized experiences, effective recommender systems (like Netflix suggestions), and continuous automation to advance technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Collaboration with Research Scientists
The future of [[AI in Product Development | AI]] in product management will involve working closely with research scientists who can build smart models for automation, personalization, and recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Product managers will need to become comfortable with the uncertainty inherent in research, where projects might be shut down if they don't work out after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

The ideal [[AI in Product Development | AI]] product exists at the intersection of:
1.  **Desirability** by users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

## When [[AI in Product Development | AI]] May Not Be the Best Approach
[[AI in Product Development | AI]] is not suitable for every problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>:
*   **Minimum Viable Products (MVPs):** Avoid using [[AI in Product Development | AI]] for MVPs. It's time-consuming and expensive to train models for initial market validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Instead, "fake it" with Figma prototypes to gather user buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Lack of Data:** [[AI in Product Development | AI]] requires substantial, high-quality data. Simple classification tasks (like cat/dog photos) might work with dozens of labeled examples, but complex applications like voice recognition or NLP need thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:16:19]</a>. Startups often lack sufficient data for building their own models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Generic Solutions:** If everyone uses the same publicly available data sets, the quality of products will be similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:51]</a>. Companies need to diversify and collect their own data for competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:59]</a>.

## Understanding [[AI in Product Development | AI]] Models
Marily Nika explains an [[AI in Product Development | AI]] model using a child's brain analogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>:
*   **What a Model Is:** Similar to how a child's brain learns to identify animals by repeatedly seeing images of rhinos and lions, an [[AI in Product Development | AI]] model is a system that takes an input (e.g., an image, text, voice) and recognizes patterns to produce an output, often with a probability of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:19:49]</a>.
*   **Training a Model:** Training involves providing vast amounts of labeled data (thousands of examples) to the model. The model processes this information, identifies complex, non-obvious patterns, and learns how to perform its task, such as classifying objects or transcribing speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:47]</a>.

## Cool Applications of [[AI in Product Development | AI]]
Marily Nika highlights a significant [[AI in Product Development | AI]] application she encountered at Google:

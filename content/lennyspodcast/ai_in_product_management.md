Marily Nika, Product Lead at Meta and instructor of a popular Maven course on [[ai_in_product_management_and_implications_for_startups | AI in product management]], emphasizes that product managers should not pursue AI for its own sake, but rather to solve existing problems in a smart way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The "Shiny Object Trap"

It's crucial to avoid the "shiny object trap" by ensuring there's a problem or pain point that needs to be solved smartly before implementing AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Once the problem and a high-level solution are identified, then the focus can shift to implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Don't do AI for the sake of doing AI.
> Make sure there is a problem there, a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_ai_in_transforming_product_management | The Role of AI in Transforming Product Management]]

Marily believes that in the future, all product managers will essentially be [[ai_product_management_career_path_and_skills | AI product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This is because products will increasingly need personalized experiences, effective recommender systems, and continuous automation improvements, all of which require an AI-centric view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

The [[future_of_product_management_with_ai | future of product management with AI]] involves collaborating with research scientists who can produce smart models for automation, personalization, and recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Product managers will need to become comfortable with the uncertainty inherent in research, where projects might be shut down if they don't yield expected results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

A successful AI-enhanced product lies at the intersection of what is:
*   Desirable by users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>
*   A viable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>
*   Feasible from a research scientist and technical perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>

## [[applications_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_for_product_managers | Applications of AI in Enhancing Productivity for Product Managers]]

AI tools can significantly enhance a product manager's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Marily uses ChatGPT daily for tasks such as:
*   **Rewriting mission statements:** ChatGPT can produce fantastic mission statements that are clear and inspiring for all stakeholders, from leadership to junior staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Creating user segments:** It can generate user segments, motivations, and pain points that a human might not think of, sparking new product ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Providing AI-enhanced ideas:** ChatGPT can offer ideas for features or improvements that leverage AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

> [!INFO] Practical AI Use Cases for PMs
> ChatGPT is a tool that enhances a PM's workflow, not replaces it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The PM initiates the core idea, and AI helps refine and expand upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Broader [[using_ai_tools_for_product_management_and_development | Applications of AI in Product Development]]

Any product can be improved with AI by:
*   Making it more secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   Personalizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
*   Enhancing it with fraud detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>
*   Making it more ethical (e.g., in healthcare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>
*   Making it faster or more accurate (e.g., in shopping for better recommendations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>
*   Improving anything where user behavior data can be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>

## Building AI into Products: Models, Training, and Data

A "model" can be thought of like a child's brain, which learns to recognize patterns from repeated information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. For example, by repeatedly showing a child pictures of rhinos and lions, their brain learns to identify these animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Similarly, an AI model takes an input (like an image) and outputs a recognition, often with a probability of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. This input can be text, video, or voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

**Training a model** involves providing thousands of labeled datasets (e.g., images of cats and dogs) so the model can process this information, learn patterns, and identify specific things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. The output of training is the model itself, which can then take new inputs and make predictions or classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

### Data Requirements

The amount of data needed for AI/ML varies significantly depending on the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   Simple classification (e.g., cat vs. dog photo) might work with 15-20 labeled photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   Complex applications like voice recognizers or sophisticated NLP require thousands of data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   Sometimes, companies even synthesize their own fake data for training and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

A key decision for AI Product Managers is determining when the quality of the product (e.g., accuracy percentage) is "good enough" to launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## When AI May Not Be the Right Approach

*   **Minimum Viable Products (MVPs):** Do not use AI for an MVP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. It's a waste of time and resources for data scientists and powerful machines that take weeks to train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Instead, "fake it" with a Figma prototype to get buy-in and prove market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Lack of data:** Many startups may not have enough data to build their own effective models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. AI should be used when there's already some data, or data from an adjacent product, that can be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

For large tech companies offering services like speech recognition or their own GPT, it makes sense to use more and diverse data to train their own models to ensure unique quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## Challenges of Being an AI PM

While the [[role_and_impact_of_ai_in_product_management | AI PM role is cool]], it comes with specific challenges:
*   **Uncertainty:** Research may not always yield optimal results, requiring resilience and leadership to keep the team motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.
*   **Change Management:** Convincing leadership and managing expectations around changing roadmaps due to research outcomes can be tricky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
*   **Data Collection:** Obtaining good, clean data is difficult, requiring creative data collection methods, sometimes even soliciting contributions from the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
*   **Career Trajectory:** AI PMs in research might not launch products as frequently as traditional PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. It's important to clarify early on how progress and assessment will be defined in a research-heavy role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

## [[ai_product_management_career_path_and_skills | Skills and Learning for AI PMs]]

Product managers should not be overwhelmed by AI technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. They don't need to code or train models themselves, though understanding the basics is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. There are even no-code approaches for training models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

Marily recommends:
*   **Shifting Mindset:** Think about how existing data can be leveraged for AI improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Learning to Code (Fundamentals):** Even if AI tools can automate tasks, understanding the underlying principles (like how to code or train a small model) builds confidence and a deeper understanding of how these tools work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. This is akin to learning classical music fundamentals before playing popular songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
*   **Shadowing AI Researchers:** If at a company with AI researchers, spend time talking to and observing them to gain context and identify potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   **Embrace Uncertainty:** Become comfortable with the unpredictable nature of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Learning Resources for AI PMs
*   **Newsletters:** "The Download" by MIT Technology Review or TLDR are good general tech sources that increasingly cover AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Online Courses:** Coursera (e.g., "Introduction to AI by Stanford") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
*   **Online Coding Schools:** Career Foundry, General Assembly, Coding Dojo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. These can teach Python basics in a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.
*   **Research Blogs/Academia:** Websites like arXiv host new research papers, which can offer early insights into emerging AI technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
*   **Marily Nika's Course:** A three-week course on Maven for aspiring and current PMs wanting to build AI products or become full-time AI PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. It covers the differences in product development lifecycle, idea creation, productionizing AI, collaborating with research scientists, and career pathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. Students develop their own AI product end-to-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.

## Getting Buy-in for AI Investments

When seeking buy-in for a big AI bet, leverage examples of successful adjacent products within the company that were AI-first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>. Propose a clear "circuit breaker" or rollback plan and emphasize the maximum negative impact, demonstrating a calculated risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. Trust built within the company, especially in cultures that welcome failure, makes it easier to pursue such risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

The role of the PM is crucial in bridging the gap between academic research and commercialization, figuring out how to monetize research findings into meaningful use cases for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

## Notable AI Applications

### Google Glass Real-time Translation
Marily previously worked on the AR/VR team at Google, which showcased an impressive real-time translation feature on Google Glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. The glass took audio input from someone speaking one language, transcribed and translated it, and displayed the text on the screen for another person in their native language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This technology demonstrates the ability of AI devices to break down communication barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

### Medical X-ray Analysis
Students in Marily's course have built impressive projects, such as an ML model that analyzed X-ray images to identify potential medical issues and suggest next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. This was achieved using no-code tools like **AutoML** by Google Cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

### Wind Turbine Maintenance with AutoML
**AutoML** allows users to train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal effort, requiring only a large dataset of corrected photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. An example application involved a company using drones to photograph wind turbines, then uploading these photos to AutoML to identify which turbines needed maintenance, reducing inspection time from weeks to hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.

### Lensa
Lensa is another popular AI-based tool where users can upload photos to generate AI-enhanced avatars, including options for pets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.

## AI and PM Job Security

Marily believes that AI will not replace product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Instead, it will make them smarter and free up their time from less strategic tasks (like writing PRDs), allowing them to focus on more strategic aspects of product management and unlock new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

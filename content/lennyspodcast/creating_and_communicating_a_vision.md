[[Developing and communicating a product vision | Creating and communicating a product vision]] is considered a crucial skill for product managers, particularly those leading new "zero to one" products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Mahika Kapor, a product manager at Figma, is highly regarded for her ability to create a compelling vision and inspire others to see it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Importance of Vision
A strong vision is paramount because the product development cycle is often chaotic and messy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. It provides an anchor during extreme highs and lows, ensuring that unexpected changes or user feedback that leads to pivots are seen as learning opportunities rather than setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. When a team and company believe in the vision, every step, even if it involves a change in direction, feels like forward progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

A well-defined vision helps define what the world will look like if the team successfully does its job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Crafting a Compelling Vision
A compelling vision cannot be created in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. It requires being "fundamentally inseparable" from users and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

Key aspects include:
*   **Cross-pollination of Functions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>: Rather than a linear process from research to design to engineering, a strong vision emerges from the continuous collaboration of different functions.
    *   Research insights help understand user feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    *   Beautiful designs and prototypes communicate the future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
    *   Rooting the vision in engineering and feasibility ensures it's achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
    *   This "confluence of ideas" from different places leads to innovation, similar to the concept in *The Medici Effect* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Communicating the Vision
Once a vision is established, the next challenge is communicating it internally and externally to help everyone see what the product manager sees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

*   **Visual Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>: Words alone are often insufficient, especially in visually-oriented cultures like Figma's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
    *   Pitches should go beyond traditional pain points, solutions, timelines, and costing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
    *   Combine these elements into a "pain point, solution, proof point" structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
    *   Use testimonials, prototypes, and mocks to make the vision compelling and emotionally resonant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Figma emphasizes a "see to believe and see to feel" approach, often designing and prototyping even before a project receives a green light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
    *   Create a single, unified artifact (e.g., a deck made in Figma) that the entire team contributes to and feels ownership over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
    *   For those without design or engineering skills, current AI tools are lowering the barrier to building prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. Additionally, reaching out to colleagues and asking for help is an effective strategy; someone will eventually say yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

### Example: FigJam's Democratic Workplace Vision
The vision for FigJam's meeting experience was rooted in the insight that brainstorms in FigJam were highly democratic, allowing ideas to come from anyone, not just the loudest voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. Figma observed an internal gap: while the company used FigJam for almost every activity (product reviews, Gantt charts, bug bashes), external users primarily used it for brainstorms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.

The vision became creating a world where the generative nature of a brainstorm was the norm for all types of meetings, fostering a more democratic workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. Features like music and voting were then launched to support this vision, helping users get into a collaborative "flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>.

## Building [[Developing Conviction and Gaining BuyIn | Conviction and Gaining Buy-in]]
[[Developing Conviction and Gaining BuyIn | Strong conviction]] allows product managers to navigate the messy "zero to one" journey and rally their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

*   **Insatiable Curiosity and User Immersion**: Developing strong product intuition comes from constantly talking to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. This builds a "repository" of conversations and anecdotes that inform product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
    *   Engage users in informal settings (e.g., dinners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.
    *   Ask *non-users* why they don't use the product, as these conversations often yield the most insightful feedback, revealing gaps in marketing or perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>.
    *   For niche products, establish strong relationships with the sales team and join sales calls to understand customer pain points and inform the product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
    *   Operationalize insights by informing roadmap prioritization and creating artifacts (e.g., loom videos, demos) that the sales team can use to evangelize the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. Non-immediately actionable feedback can be stored in a backlog for later grooming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

*   **Proactive Pitching**: It's better to put out an idea, even if it's "totally wrong," than to start from nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. People are more likely to react to an idea, leading to feedback that can refine it into a stronger, more opinionated solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. This aligns with the "strong opinions, weakly held" philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

*   **Transparency in Confidence**: When presenting ideas, be explicit about your level of confidence (e.g., "medium confidence") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. This encourages team members to speak up and offer their own perspectives, fostering a culture where everyone feels comfortable giving their opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.

## Spreading the Idea and [[Storytelling and drawing in product management | Building Hype]]
Building "hype" is crucial for new products, both internally to gain [[Developing Conviction and Gaining BuyIn | buy-in]] and externally to excite users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.

*   **Proactive Momentum**: The product manager is the "keeper of the flame" for a zero-to-one idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>. It's their responsibility to continuously create forward progress and ensure the product is propped up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. This means leveraging large internal forums like hackathons ([[Building an Entrepreneurial Culture | Maker Week]] at Figma) and sales kickoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
    *   Even if a product is early and buggy, demonstrating it in a high-visibility company-wide forum can generate excitement and provide valuable product insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.
    *   Hype is most effective when it stems from genuine belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.

*   **Emotional Connection**: Hype is tied to emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. Users should feel that the product was built *for them* to make them feel special or happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.
    *   Example: For FigJam's one-year anniversary, features were "Easter egged" throughout the product as "birthday presents" for users, aligning with FigJam's "cheeky" and "fun" brand personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
    *   Understand each product's unique "brand of delight" (e.g., Figma's niche design capabilities, Apple's unboxing experience) to tailor hype generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.

*   **Long Staging/Dogfooding Process**: Figma's multi-month staging process for new products is crucial for gathering feedback and fostering investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. When people give feedback and see it implemented, they feel like they "shaped that part of the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. This open process elevates product quality and creates a collective investment in success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>.

*   **Understanding Motivations**: To drive an idea forward, it's essential to understand the individual motivations of team members (engineers, designers, researchers, data scientists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:09">[01:30:09]</a>. Some prefer clear solutions, while others need to contribute to feel passionate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>. Catering to individual needs rather than the average leads to higher-functioning teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Asking directly about involvement preferences can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>.

## Keeping the Flame Alive
An entrepreneurially-minded PM needs to constantly think about what's next for the company and define the industry standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. Figma's "run with it" culture encourages individuals to sprint in new directions, viewing it as a manifestation of company values rather than a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. Many of Figma's monumental launches originated from hackathons and bottom-up projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>.

The ability to "stok[e] the flames and the embers" of an idea, even without formal backing, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>. This means being adaptable with resources, knowing when to pivot priorities (e.g., from speakers to fundraising), and being resourceful to make things happen (e.g., using a `.edu` email address for cold outreach) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>. If a PM has a unique insight that others aren't seeing, it is even more important for them to vocalize it and get others on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>.

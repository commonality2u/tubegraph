Linear, the issue tracking tool, has adopted several [[building_a_highperformance_team | unique strategies]] for its operations and [[building_and_managing_growth_teams | team management]], prioritizing quality, craft, and an autonomous approach over traditional metrics-driven methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Core Principles

Ki Sarin, co-founder and CEO of Linear, outlines several foundational beliefs that shape the company's approach:
*   **Design Matters** The more a domain or industry matters, the more design matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In a crowded market, high-level design is essential for products to gain attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> and to be considered seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. Design acts as an enabler, similar to good technology, by drawing users in and improving their perception of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.
*   **Focus on Craft and Quality** Linear has a "huge focus on craft and quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, believing that for the business to be successful, quality and craft are "very important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   This commitment starts with hiring people who care about craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   While quality can impact timelines, delaying a launch by a few days to fix issues is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   The aim is to balance a "perfection mindset" with rapid iteration, pushing out features quickly and then improving them rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
    *   Quality is fostered by giving project teams greater ownership, enabling engineers and designers to identify and implement improvements beyond initial specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **No AB Tests, No Metrics-Based Goals** Linear does not rely on A/B tests or specific metrics-based goals for features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Instead, it focuses on "taste and opinions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> and solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>.
    *   While company-level goals (like weekly active users) exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>, feature success is determined by customer agreement that the problem is solved and their enjoyment of the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
    *   This approach is favored because Linear's product is a complex system used by diverse companies, making single metric optimization less suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

## Teambuilding and Product Management

### Minimal Product Managers
Linear operates with only one Product Manager, who serves as the Head of Product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   This structure means engineers and designers take on responsibilities traditionally held by PMs, such as thinking about scope, communicating progress, and project leading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.
*   This approach requires hiring individuals interested in a broader scope beyond just their specific skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   The Head of Product focuses on defining product direction and aligning teams, rather than managing every detail or decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   The company believes that the product itself should make the PM's job easier by empowering engineers with usage data and streamlined workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

### Dynamic Team Assembly
Instead of durable cross-functional teams, Linear's teams "assemble around a project and then disperse once it's done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### The Linear Method
This methodology, shared publicly online, emphasizes [[building_and_managing_growth_teams | opinionated software]] and consistent workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Opinionated Software:** Productivity software, especially for companies, should be opinionated to enhance productivity by reducing decision-making time for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. By providing "good defaults or good opinions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>, users can focus on their actual work rather than configuring the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Cycles:** Similar to Sprints, cycles are fixed timeframes (e.g., one or two weeks) where a team commits to a set of priorities, helping them focus and manage distractions from an "infinite list of things to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. Cycles run on an automated schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

## Hiring and Culture
Linear maintains an extremely [[building_and_structuring_a_highperforming_growth_team | high hiring bar]] and grows slowly, never more than doubling in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.
*   **Beyond Skill Sets:** The company seeks candidates with "taste" and a "broader perspective" beyond their specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>. For example, engineers are interviewed for "product sensibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>, and marketing hires for storytelling ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   **Broader Scope and Ownership:** This approach leads to a company where people can easily pick up different tasks and rarely claim "it's not my job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. Employees are empowered to take on and own more scope earlier in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.
*   **Paid Work Trial:** As a final step in the hiring process, candidates undergo a paid work trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>. They act as mini-contractors, tackling a vague problem, scoping it, and building a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. This allows both parties to assess working compatibility and for candidates to experience Linear's code base and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.

### Customer-Centricity and Intuition
Linear integrates customer understanding deeply into its processes, fostering a culture of "magic and science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.
*   The "science" involves extensive user research, weekly calls with customers, engaging with customer Slack channels, and sometimes reviewing telemetry data to understand usage patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.
*   The "magic" comes from informed intuition: when the entire team has a deep understanding of customer problems and the product, decisions can be made using intuition rather than solely relying on data or metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. This means being okay with making mistakes and fixing them quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

### Focus and Avoiding "Side Quests"
A key operational strategy is a strict focus on the "main quest line" of [[strategies_for_company_growth_and_overcoming_internal_challenges | building the product]] and making it "awesome for customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. This means avoiding "side quests"â€”ideas that sound good but don't directly contribute to the core product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. This philosophy is applied at both the company and individual level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>.

## Product Launch and Growth

Linear launched its company in April 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a> and operated in a private beta for nearly a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.
*   **Selective Onboarding:** Initial access was controlled via a waitlist that included a survey asking about current tools, company size, and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. Linear selectively invited smaller companies using specific tools it supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.
*   **Cohort-Based Development:** Instead of inviting everyone at once, Linear released the product to small cohorts of users. This allowed them to gather feedback on specific issues, fix them, and then invite the next cohort, leading to a more effective initial development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.
*   **Early Monetization Experiment:** During private beta, Linear introduced an optional payment feature with a sliding scale for per-seat pricing, allowing users to pay what they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. This provided some confidence in pricing and market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.
*   **Targeted Product-Market Fit:** Linear initially focused on achieving product-market fit within the "early stage startup" segment, aiming to become their default tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>. They then expanded their focus to larger company segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. This segmented approach to product-market fit is seen as a spectrum, not a binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.
*   **Authentic Launch Communication:** The public launch involved personalized messages from each founder, explaining their reasons for building Linear, which resonated strongly with the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:34">[01:23:34]</a>.

## Remote Team Engagement

As a fully remote and distributed company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:17">[01:25:17]</a>, Linear faces challenges with group gatherings due to time zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>.
*   **Baking Competition:** Inspired by The Great British Baking Show, Linear hosts quarterly baking or cooking competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:46">[01:25:46]</a>. Participants receive a recipe, buy ingredients with a company card, and cook together on Zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>. This activity fosters camaraderie, allows for casual conversation, and reinforces the company's value of "craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>.

## Leadership Perspective

Ki Sarin's experience as CEO highlights the broad and varied responsibilities of a leadership role, encompassing everything from compensation plans and marketing to offsites and legal matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of hiring and delegation to manage this wide scope, allowing leaders to focus on strategic areas while also continuously learning about new domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:54">[01:29:54]</a>. A key [[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking | leadership motto]] is "go slow to go fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>, advocating for thoughtful planning over rushing to avoid later fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:32">[01:36:32]</a>.

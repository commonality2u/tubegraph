Marily Nika, a product lead at Meta focusing on metaverse avatars and identity, and formerly at Google working on Google Glass, computer vision, and machine learning around speech recognition, shares her insights on [[AI in Product Development | AI in product development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. She also teaches a popular Maven course on [[AI in Product Development | AI and product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Problem-First Approach

It's crucial to avoid the "shiny object trap" when approaching AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Don't engage with AI just for the sake of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Instead, focus on identifying a real problem or pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Once the problem and a high-level solution are clear, then explore how to implement it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Marily Nika defines an [[how_to_become_an_ai_product_manager | AI product manager]] as someone who "helps their team company solve the right problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. The goal is to find the intersection of user desirability, business viability, and technical feasibility from a research scientist's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## The Future of Product Management with AI

The belief is that in the future, "everything will be AI by default" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This means all product managers will essentially become [[how_to_become_an_ai_product_manager | AI product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This shift is driven by the need for:
*   Personalized experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>
*   Effective recommender systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>
*   Continuous automation improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>

AI doesn't replace human work but enhances it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, freeing up time for more strategic tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

## Leveraging AI Tools in Product Management

[[leveraging_ai_tools_in_product_management | AI tools available today]] can significantly enhance a PM's job performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Practical Applications
*   **Mission Statements**: Tools like ChatGPT can rewrite mission statements to be universally understood and inspiring across all disciplinesâ€”leadership, junior staff, stakeholders, competitors, and even children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **User Segmentation**: AI can generate creative and diverse user segments with motivations and pain points that a human might not consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. For example, asking who would be interested in a screen-less fitness band could yield ideas like young professionals or those who dislike daily charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Idea Generation**: AI can provide ideas for new AI-enhanced features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## When to Use AI in Product Development

AI is beneficial for enhancing products in various ways where data can be leveraged to improve user behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>:
*   Security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   Personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
*   Fraud detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>
*   Ethical considerations (e.g., healthcare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>
*   Speed and accuracy (e.g., shopping recommendations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>

### When Not to Use AI
*   **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: Do not use AI for an MVP to prove a market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. It's too time-consuming and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Instead, "fake it" with a Figma prototype to gauge user interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Lack of Data**: AI thrives on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. If a team isn't collecting data or lacks dashboards, that's a fundamental first step before considering AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Insufficient Data for Models**:
    *   Simple classification tasks (e.g., cat vs. dog) might only need 15-20 labeled photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
    *   Complex applications like voice recognizers or NLP require thousands of data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Startups often lack the necessary data to build their own models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

## Understanding AI Models and Training

*   **What is a Model?**: A model is like a child's brain, capable of taking an input (e.g., an image) and recognizing what it is, outputting a probability of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. For example, a speech recognition model takes audio input and outputs a text transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.
*   **Training a Model**: This involves providing thousands of labeled data points (e.g., images of cats and dogs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. The model processes this information, learns patterns, and then can identify new inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. The output of training is not typically human-readable code but a system that can process inputs and produce outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

## Challenges in [[Impact of AI on product teams | AI Product Management]]
*   **Uncertainty**: Research-driven AI projects involve inherent uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. Model training results may not always align with initial hypotheses, requiring the PM to encourage and guide the team through this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.
*   **Changing Objectives**: AI products can necessitate frequent changes in objectives and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. Managing this from a leadership perspective can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.
*   **Data Acquisition**: Obtaining sufficient, high-quality data is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. PMs need to be creative in data collection methods, even resorting to unconventional approaches like asking people for data on the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
*   **Career Trajectory**: Traditional PM career progression often relies on frequent product launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. In AI research roles, launches are less frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. It's essential to clarify assessment criteria and progress metrics with hiring managers early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

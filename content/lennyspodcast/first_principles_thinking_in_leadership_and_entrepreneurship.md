First principles thinking involves breaking down problems to their fundamental truths, rather than reasoning by analogy or relying on existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. This approach is exemplified by Toby, CEO of Shopify, who believes in questioning assumptions and striving for optimal solutions regardless of the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

## The Energy Source: Dissatisfaction with the Status Quo
Toby's primary energy source is a deep dissatisfaction with the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. He views today's world as the "dystopia of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>, which compels builders to create products that drive progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. He defaults to not doing things the way most people do them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

> "If most people are doing it a certain way, I by default don't want to do it that way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>

## Principles in Leadership
Toby's [[leadership_principles_and_skills | leadership]] style embodies first principles thinking through several key practices:

### Challenging Path Dependence and Overfitting
Existing solutions and products are often "path dependent," meaning they were built based on compromises or truths that may no longer apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. He is suspicious of proposals that aim to create "a good version of the same thing everyone else does" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
A key concept Toby references is **Goodhart's Law**: "Any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a good metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This concept, akin to "overfitting" in machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, means that optimizing for a proxy metric can lead to cheating the benchmark rather than achieving the true objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

### Embracing the Unquantifiable
While [[importance_of_first_principles_thinking_in_product_development | data-informed]], Shopify's core product team operates without strict KPIs or OKRs, prioritizing "taste and intuition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Toby emphasizes the importance of unquantifiable aspects like quality, passion, love, fun, and delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. He believes the overlap between the most valuable product actions and quantifiable metrics is only about 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

> "Pessimism sounds extremely sophisticated. Optimism always sounds dumb or at least naive. The most powerful unquantifiable things in the world of business are fun and delight." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>

### Maximizing Human Potential
Toby approaches feedback with the conviction that no one is close to their maximum potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. He sees reminding people of their potential as a "wonderful thing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, even if it requires direct and sometimes hard-to-hear feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This approach encourages individuals to achieve things they didn't imagine possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### The "Toby Tornado" and Sunk Costs
The "Toby tornado" describes Toby's rapid and direct approach to change management, where projects are stopped quickly if they are not deemed viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This is seen not as arbitrary but as a refusal to let people work on something that isn't going to succeed, compressing time and optimizing for career impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This involves being willing to change direction and not being constrained by sunk costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.

### Being "Close to the Metal"
Toby's deep involvement in coding, even as CEO, reflects his belief in understanding the "atomic building blocks" of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. This hands-on approach provides him with high-fidelity information, enabling him to "rerun the entire function over the state that is now updated" and make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. This is a core part of his [[engineering_leadership_and_strategy | engineering leadership]].

### Embracing Disagreement
Toby actively seeks out disagreement, viewing it as a sign of courage and a way to uncover unstated foundational assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. He will sometimes play "devil's advocate" to provoke deeper arguments and ensure decisions are well-grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. He aligns with the "when the facts change, I change my opinion" philosophy, prioritizing being correct over being consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>.

## Principles in Entrepreneurship and Product Development

### The 100-Year Vision
Shopify operates with a "100-year vision" focused on its core mission: making [[philosophy_and_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurship]] more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. This long-term perspective influences decision-making, prioritizing enduring value over short-term gains or "putting future profits forward at a discount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.

### The Corporate Marshmallow Test
Toby likens long-term business partnerships to an "iterated prisoner's dilemma" or a "corporate marshmallow test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. Companies with a long-term horizon understand that coordinating and playing "positive sum games" with partners (like Shopify's relationship with Stripe) creates far more value over time than short-term defection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.

> "On a long enough timeline, playing positive sum games with your customers is the ultimate growth hack." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>

### The Chess Analogy: Positional Game vs. Tactics
Company building is like playing chess, with two independent games:
*   **Positional Game**: Developing influence, gaining trust, defining territory, and ensuring product fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>. This is about long-term strategy and building inherent value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.
*   **Tactics**: Short-term wins and immediate conversions (e.g., A/B testing button colors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>. While necessary to "not go out of business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>, over-reliance on tactics can extract all created value, leading to companies fading away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>.

Founders should focus on the infinite game of the mission and the positional game, creating finite, winnable games for the rest of the company to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. This aligns with [[applying_startup_principles_to_large_companies | applying startup principles to large companies]].

### Lowering the Courage Bar for Entrepreneurs
Shopify's fundamental goal is to make it easier to start businesses online than in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. This is achieved by creating software that tames complexity and automates challenging aspects like taxes or payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>. By reducing complexity, Shopify "causes more entrepreneurship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>, allowing individuals to overcome fear and naysaying that often discourage them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>. This is a core [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | entrepreneurial lesson]].

### The Talent Stack and Curiosity
Toby advises focusing on one's "talent stack," which is the unique intersection of skills and curiosities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>. By following genuine curiosity and optimizing for maximum learning, individuals can discover unique strengths and opportunities that others might miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>. This aligns with [[authenticity_and_curiosity_in_leadership | authenticity and curiosity in leadership]]. Toby believes everyone is an entrepreneur, selling their "talent as a service," and success comes from being "too good to ignore" in a specific niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:43">[01:34:43]</a>.

## Founder Mode and Product Quality
Toby concludes that the quality of any product is a direct reflection of how much the creators "give a damn" about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:17">[01:37:17]</a>. Product leaders must be "exothermically infectious" in their care for the product to inspire the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. This embodies [[embracing_founder_mode_in_product_leadership | embracing founder mode in product leadership]], where leaders inject "heat" into the business to ensure outperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. Toby posits that founder-run companies often maintain innovation longer because leaders protect this "heat-pumping" ethos from internal resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">[01:40:12]</a>.

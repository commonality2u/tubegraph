At Whiz, creating effective brand awareness and marketing required unconventional approaches, deep product understanding, and a willingness to experiment. Ros, Whiz's Chief Marketing Officer and VP of Product Strategy, transitioned from an engineering and product background to lead the company's marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

## Identifying the Need for Marketing
Initially, Whiz, though experiencing rapid growth and strong product-market fit, faced a significant challenge in [[Building a brand for startups | brand awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Customers often discovered Whiz too late, having already signed with competitors, indicating a gap in their [[Role of marketing in product success | marketing and outreach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. For Ros, this meant addressing the need to scale and recognize that [[Building a brand for startups | brand matters a lot]] even for complex B2B products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Ros's Approach to Marketing
Rosâ€™s transition into marketing was unplanned and she admitted to having a "ton to learn about marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, initially not even knowing terms like "lead" or "pipeline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Her strategy was shaped by her product background and a willingness to take risks:

### Focus on Making Noise
Unlike product development where "less is more" and mistakes are costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>, marketing allows for constant experimentation with little to no maintenance cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Ros emphasized trying "everything" to make noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Unconventional Branding and Events
Whiz deliberately chose a unique approach to stand out. For example, at RSA (a major security conference), instead of a typical "dark and red" cyber booth, they created a "Whiz of Oz" themed booth with actors and a bright, optimistic brand aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This drastically increased engagement and differentiated Whiz in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This contrarian approach to brand and messaging allowed them to "take chances" and "make a lot of noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

### The "Heat" Metaphor
Ros describes the shifting "heat" or focus within a growing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>:
*   **Early days:** Heat is in the product, building something customers want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Next phase:** Moves to engineering to build and refine the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Sales take over:** Heat shifts to sales to close deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Scaling:** Heat moves to marketing when sales needs more pipeline and awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Learning from the Market
Ros believes effective marketing stems from understanding your audience and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Her background in security allowed her to "know what matters" to their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. She recommends studying successful brands, regardless of industry, and analyzing what their marketing teams do well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Key Principles for Effective Marketing

### The "Dummy Explanation"
Ros emphasizes simplifying communication. Product teams, deeply immersed in their domain, can accidentally use "fluffy or blurry" language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Marketing must bridge this gap by delivering "crystal clear" messages that can scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

> "You can often kind of work with things that are like uh fluffy or blurry or like gray...in a way that when you try to scale your message you can't like it gets lost in translation you have to be Crystal Clear black and white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>

This means avoiding industry jargon and assuming deep knowledge. For example, while product teams might use "CNAPP" for cloud security, the market searches for "cloud security solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Every message should be understandable by anyone, without assuming prior knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Trust and Product Knowledge
CMOs often fail because they lack the deep trust with the founding team and a profound connection to the product and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Ros highlights that building this trust is difficult and easily broken by misaligned messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Her experience within the security domain was crucial, as she truly understood the customer's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

### Embrace Failure
A core aspect of Whiz's and Ros's philosophy is being "okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail at something and still attempting it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. This mindset, fostered early in life, allows for taking risks and learning from experiences without fear of negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

> "I won't be able to build that confidence I do feel like an imposter...maybe embrace it but don't let that um stop you from from making a decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>

This approach is particularly valuable in marketing, where experimentation is key. If a marketing effort doesn't work, there's no technical debt or lasting consequence; you simply try something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

These strategies, rooted in deep customer empathy, clear communication, and a daring approach to [[Understanding and executing effective product positioning strategies | brand building]], contributed significantly to Whiz's rapid growth and market leadership in cloud security.

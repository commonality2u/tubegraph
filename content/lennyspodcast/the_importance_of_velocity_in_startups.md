Velocity is paramount to the success of a startup. For companies like Ramp, which achieved over $100 million in annual run rate in two years, becoming the fastest-growing SaaS business in history, velocity is ingrained in every aspect of their operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

## Ramp's Success Through Velocity

Ramp's rapid growth exemplifies the power of velocity:
*   Within three months of Jeff Charles joining, a team of ten (eight engineers) built a competitor to MX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Six months later, they built a competitor to Expensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   They hit $100 million in annual revenue with less than 50 people in the R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   A small team (three engineers, one designer, one PM) built an accounts payable product, a competitor to Bill.com, in three months, which now moves billions of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## Why Velocity is Critical

At Ramp, velocity influences product development, team incentives, hiring, promotions, decision-making, and organizational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

### Key Drivers for Velocity
*   **Market Opportunity** During the pandemic, Ramp identified a huge market opportunity, making execution speed more important than the specific path chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Talent Attraction** High velocity attracts top talent who want to build and ship things quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **De-risking Decisions** When the cost of a decision is low due to speed, it simplifies decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Operationalizing Velocity

Ramp implements specific practices to achieve its high velocity:

### Small, Single-Threaded Teams
Teams are kept small with a "single threaded" focus, meaning individuals concentrate on only one goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This removes distractions and allows intense focus on that one objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. For example, a single-threaded team built the Flex product focused solely on e-commerce companies' cash flow needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### Lofty Goals
Inspired by market comparables (e.g., Bill.com, Expensify), Ramp sets ambitious, motivating goals tied to market opportunities and revenue targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Visualizing the future product through design prototypes also serves as a strong motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

### Shielding Teams
Leaders protect core teams from external chaos, such as bugs or customer requests. This is achieved through:
*   A rotational program for production engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   Product operators who handle documentation, escalations, release management, and customer requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   New product teams typically have no responsibility for existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

### Context Over Control
Ramp fosters empowerment by providing teams with context rather than micromanaging solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Leaders align teams on goals, hypotheses, and supporting data, trusting them to devise the best solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. The role of management is to share context that teams might be missing from high-level meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

Teams operate under a "contract" consisting of their strategy and roadmap, which guides their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This strategy document covers goals, hypotheses, unique positioning, metrics, initiatives, risks, and long-term outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Minimizing Meetings and Process
Excessive meetings and status updates are seen as a major waste of time that demotivate teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Ramp prioritizes asynchronous updates and focuses meetings on collaboration, ideation, and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

### Clear Trade-offs
Leaders must be explicit about the trade-offs required for velocity. Presenting a menu of choices (e.g., focusing on one market segment vs. another) helps avoid diffuse efforts and enables faster execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## Velocity and Quality

Contrary to common belief, Ramp finds that quality *increases* with velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. The ability to fix issues quickly and iterate means less time is wasted, and feedback loops are shorter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

Control mechanisms are in place to ensure velocity doesn't compromise quality:
*   **Voice of Customer Process**: All negative customer reviews are shared monthly with the relevant tech lead, PM, and designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **NPS and CSAT**: These metrics are regularly reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Operational Overhead**: Teams are held accountable for the percentage of support tickets originating from their product area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Bug Assignment**: Bugs are assigned directly to the engineer on call, fostering immediate pain points and quick fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Ramp has no bug backlog; issues are fixed as soon as they're surfaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **User Experience Metrics**: If the number of support tickets due to customer confusion is elevated, teams are restricted from shipping new features until those issues are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## Avoiding Burnout with Velocity

Velocity can help avoid burnout by ensuring high impact and fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. When effort leads to tangible progress, it feels less like a chore and more like a thrilling flow state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Empowerment and clear alignment on goals are key to making work feel meaningful to individual contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## Planning and Chaos

Ramp acknowledges that high velocity can lead to a degree of chaos, which is openly communicated to new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This chaos is viewed as a necessary byproduct of hyper-growth and continuous innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

The company primarily plans for "large market moments" involving coordinated marketing and sales efforts, which constitute a small percentage of total R&D focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. For most other work, the focus is on rapid execution over precise, time-consuming planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

While tactical elements may shift, Ramp maintains a consistent long-term vision, problem definition, and value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

## Hiring for Velocity

To sustain a culture of velocity, Ramp prioritizes hiring specific traits:
*   **Desire for Impact**: Candidates should demonstrate a strong desire to see their work make a real difference and win in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Deep Thinking**: The ability to [[role_of_inflections_and_insights_in_startups | think from first principles]] and thoroughly analyze decisions and trade-offs is crucial, even over prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   **Proactiveness and Accountability**: Ideal engineers are curious about the business, proactive in solving problems (even outside their direct tasks), and take ownership of their product's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

Ramp's CTO, Kareem, spent the first year almost exclusively focused on hiring top engineering and design talent, which had compounding effects on the company's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## Advice for Product Managers

For PMs seeking to foster velocity in their organizations:
*   **Advocate for R&D Investment**: Push for top-down investment in high-quality R&D talent, paying market rates, and building a strong technical brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Eliminate Wasteful Process**: Actively kill meetings and processes that don't directly contribute to building and shipping, especially status updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Communicate Trade-offs**: Clearly articulate the trade-offs involved when leaders demand speed and many features simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Distribute PM Responsibilities**: Empower designers to think about specs and priorities, and engineers to take ownership of breaking down work and creating tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This distributes the PM job across other team members, increasing leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   **Foster Team Culture**: Build a strong team culture within individual pods, as managers may not be directly in the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   **Protect the Team**: Serve as the central point of contact for external stakeholders, shielding the core team from distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

This philosophy underscores the focus on action. For PMs, this means embracing time for deep thinking rather than constant meetings or simply Googling answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This helps in [[role_of_inflections_and_insights_in_startups | crystallizing problems]] and understanding [[role_of_inflections_and_insights_in_startups | new insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

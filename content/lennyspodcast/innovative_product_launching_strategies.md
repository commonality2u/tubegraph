Traditional approaches to [[developing_and_launching_new_products_in_a_company | product development]] often fall into the misconception of "build it and they will come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. However, truly [[creating_a_winning_product_strategy | successful products]] and [[innovative_product_development_strategies | launching strategies]] stem from understanding why people "hire" products, not just buy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This core principle underpins the Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework, co-created by Bob Moesta and Clay Christensen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>.

## Core Principle: People "Hire" Products for Progress

The fundamental premise of JTBD is that people "hire" products to make progress in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This progress is driven by a specific context and a desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This perspective reveals that different products can compete for the same "job" even if they are from vastly different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Snickers vs. Milky Way
> While both are candy bars, a Snickers is often "hired" when someone has missed a meal, needs energy, and wants to return to tasks quickly, competing with items like protein drinks, Red Bull, or coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. A Milky Way, however, is typically consumed after an emotional experience, often alone, for regrouping, competing with a glass of wine, a brownie, or even a run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This illustrates how JTBD helps identify the true competitive set from the "demand side" (customer needs) rather than the "supply side" (product features or business model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Instead of creating products and then finding demand, JTBD emphasizes that demand is caused by a "struggling moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This focus on customer-centricity and understanding these struggling moments guides the entire [[product_management_strategies_and_frameworks | product management]] and [[creating_a_winning_product_strategy | product strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Understanding the "Four Forces" of Progress

People don't randomly adopt new products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Their decisions are influenced by four forces:
1.  **Push (F1):** A "push" from the old product or situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This is the context or struggling moment that motivates a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
2.  **Pull (F2):** The "pull" of the new solution or desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This is the envisioned progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
3.  **Anxiety (F3):** Anxiety associated with the new solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. More features can actually *increase* anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
4.  **Habit (F4):** The habit of the present or loyalty to the old solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

For a customer to switch or adopt a new product, the forces of push and pull (F1 + F2) must be greater than the anxiety and habit (F3 + F4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This framing allows companies to see the market as a system of behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Reducing friction (F3 and F4) can be as effective as adding new features (increasing F2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Housing Development
> In a housing development, customers would cancel condo purchases because they didn't know how to get rid of their old furniture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. By including moving services and two years of storage in the condo price (increasing the price but reducing friction), sales increased by over 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## The Customer's Buying Journey: A Phased Approach

The customer's buying process is not linear or random; it has distinct phases that should inform [[sales_strategies_for_startups | sales strategies]] and product positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Bob Moesta identifies six phases:
1.  **First Thought:** The initial realization of a struggle.
2.  **Passive Looking:** The customer is problem-aware but solution-unaware, learning about options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
3.  **Active Looking:** The customer is problem and solution aware, framing a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
4.  **Deciding:** Making trade-offs between different alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
5.  **First Use:** The initial experience with the new product.
6.  **Ongoing Use:** How the new habit is built and sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Autobooks
> Autobooks, a company enabling banks to offer invoicing via Apple Pay, adapted their sales process by understanding these phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Instead of a single demo, they offered three different demos tailored to where the bank was in their buying journey: one for background on the problem (passive looking), one for alternatives (active looking), and one for choices (deciding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This approach halved the sales process time and quadrupled conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

## Effective Customer Insights for Product Launch

The JTBD framework relies heavily on deep customer understanding, moving beyond superficial surveys or opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

### Interviewing for Causation
Instead of asking what people want, interview them about what *caused* them to make a specific purchase or change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This technique, derived from criminal and intelligence interrogation, focuses on the story of *how* they decided "today's the day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

> [!TIP] Interviewing New Products (0 to 1)
> For new products that don't yet exist, study what people would *stop using* when your product comes out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>. Interview users of existing alternatives (e.g., eBay or Etsy for a new marketplace) to uncover the jobs they are trying to do and why they might switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. This allows for [[innovative_product_development_strategies | innovation]] without having a product in the market yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.

### Beyond Stated Desires
Customers often express desires (e.g., "I want granite countertops") that don't reflect their actual trade-offs when making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Focus on collecting stories of *actual behavior* to understand the functional (time, effort), emotional (frustration, desire for respect), and social (how others perceive them) energies driving their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] "Bitching Ain't Switching"
> Just because someone complains about a product doesn't mean they will switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. The key is to find people who have *already tried* to make progress, even if they failed, to understand what compelled them to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

### Practical Interview Tips
*   **No Discussion Guide:** Avoid a rigid script. Instead, use the pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits framework to guide the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Story:** Ask "tell me more about that" or "give me an example" instead of repetitive "why" questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   **Mirroring and Playing Back Incorrectly:** Use techniques like mirroring or intentionally playing back information incorrectly to encourage the interviewee to elaborate and correct you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Small Sample Size:** Causal mechanisms tend to repeat quickly. Seven to eight interviews are often enough, typically doing 10-12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   **Talk to Churners:** For existing products, interview people who have churned. They are still making progress but found your product too hard or insufficient, revealing valuable struggling moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

## Strategic Product Development and Positioning

### Focusing on "What People Will Fire"
A powerful way to frame a new product is to consider "what will people stop using when your product comes out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>. This allows companies to identify direct competitors and understand the existing "jobs" in the market. There are generally no truly new jobs, only better ways to deliver on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.

### Making Deliberate Trade-offs
Many products fail because they add too many features or make trade-offs that don't align with customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Instead, focus on understanding the specific "vector of progress" (the context of where the customer starts and the desired outcome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>. This leads to the principle of "choose what to suck at" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. Don't try to be everything to everyone; instead, align your product's trade-offs with those the customer is willing to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>.

## Real-world Applications and Examples

The JTBD framework has been applied to successfully launch and evolve products across various industries:

*   **Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU):** In 2010, SNHU discovered students attending online without coming to class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. By studying these "anomalies," they realized these students had a different job: returning to school as older adults with responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This insight led them to cater to this unmet need, growing to over 200,000 students and becoming one of the largest universities globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Intercom:** Intercom realized their product was "hired" for four distinct reasons. Instead of building different products, they allowed users to turn off irrelevant features based on their specific "job" (e.g., acquiring customers vs. providing support). They then adjusted their pricing model to match the competition for each specific job, contributing to their multi-billion dollar valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Basecamp:** Despite user requests for features like Gantt charts, Basecamp learned that their core users valued simplicity. Adding complex features would have alienated their existing customer base who hired them for a simpler project management experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Building Houses:** Homebuilders discovered that while downsizers claimed they didn't want a dining room, they often couldn't move because they didn't know where their existing dining room table (an emotional bank account) would go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. By building a symbolic space for a dining table (even if not functional for dining), sales increased by 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.

By understanding the "struggling moments" and the underlying causal mechanisms of customer behavior, companies can develop truly [[effective_product_management_strategies | effective product management strategies]] and [[marketing_strategies_and_growth | marketing strategies and growth]], leading to successful product launches and sustained growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

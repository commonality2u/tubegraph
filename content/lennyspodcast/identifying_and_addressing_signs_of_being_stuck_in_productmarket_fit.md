[[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | Finding product market fit]] is described as the single most important thing a startup does in its first three years, yet it remains an underexplored and underexplained topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explores a [[framework_for_improving_productmarket_fit | product market fit framework]] developed by First Round Capital, based on consistent patterns observed in hundreds of startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The goal of this [[framework_for_improving_productmarket_fit | framework]] is to provide a practical and actionable guide for founders to increase their odds of [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | finding product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Being stuck in a particular stage of [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] is a common challenge for startups, with the majority never progressing past the first two levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. This framework aims to help founders understand which stage they are in, what to do if they are stuck, and what elements to change to get unstuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Product Market Fit: A Phased Journey

[[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | Product market fit]] is not a sudden, overnight event, especially for B2B companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. It follows a repeatable pattern through four distinct levels, gradually shifting focus across three key dimensions:
1.  **Satisfaction**: How much customers love and are satisfied with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
2.  **Demand**: The widespread need or desire for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
3.  **Efficiency**: The ability to deliver the product repeatably and profitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

The four levels of [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] are:
*   **Level 1: Nascent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>
*   **Level 2: Developing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>
*   **Level 3: Strong** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>
*   **Level 4: Extreme** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>

For the best Enterprise companies, reaching [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | extreme product market fit]] typically takes roughly four to six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.

### Level 1: Nascent Product Market Fit

At this initial stage, you're likely a pre-seed or seed-stage company with fewer than 10 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

*   **Goal**: Find three to five customers who have a specific, important, and urgent problem that your solution can deeply satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Prioritize **satisfaction** above all else. It's acceptable to be inefficient at this stage if it helps uncover an intensely satisfying customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   ARR: $0 to $500k <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
    *   Demand Source: Mostly friends, family, and network (warm intros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. It's hard to find customers, potentially taking 20 warm intros for one sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
    *   Efficiency metrics (burn multiple, gross margin, NRR) are not applicable yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

*   **Signs of Being Stuck (Yellow Flags)**: If you're lingering at this level for 6-12 months and experiencing these signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>:
    *   Customers wouldn't be very disappointed if your product disappeared overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.
    *   Your handful of happy customers each prioritize different features, making it feel more like a consulting business than a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
    *   It's incredibly hard to find the next customer (marginal customer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.
    *   Usage is low and not growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.
    *   Customers "friendzone" you â€“ they like you, but don't *need* you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.

*   **How to Get Unstuck**: This is the most important level to get right, and it requires being willing to make significant changes to the "Four Ps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>.
    *   **Example: Vanta** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>: Initially, Christina Copo explored other ideas like a "B2B Alexa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. By talking to security engineers, she discovered the deep pain of security questionnaires and compliance audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. She manually delivered a solution (a spreadsheet) that unlocked revenue for early customers, demonstrating extreme satisfaction even without an efficient product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
    *   **Example: Lattis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>: Started as an OKR tool, but customers only used it for one quarter and didn't see enough value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. The founder, Jack Altman, realized he had kept the *Persona* (Head of HR) but needed to change the *Problem* and *Promise* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. He pivoted to performance management, showing Figma mockups, and found immense demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

### Level 2: Developing Product Market Fit

Now you're scaling from initial customers to a more substantial base.

*   **Goal**: Grow from 5 satisfied customers to 25 satisfied customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Begin thinking about **demand** in addition to satisfaction. The product needs to start doing more of the heavy lifting to acquire customers, rather than relying solely on willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   Team Size: Up to 20 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.
    *   ARR: $500k to $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
    *   Demand Source: Early signs of a scalable channel beyond warm intros, such as cold outreach, content, or community events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Sales conversion without warm intros is still around 10% (first call to close) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>.
    *   Efficiency Metrics: Start thinking about them, but they aren't the primary focus.
        *   Magic Number (new ARR / CAC): 0.5 to 0.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.
        *   Regretted Churn: Around 10-20% is okay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
        *   Net Revenue Retention (NRR): At least 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.
        *   Gross Margin: Not worse than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.
        *   Burn Multiple (burn / new ARR): Not worse than 5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

*   **Signs of Being Stuck (Yellow Flags)**: If you're stuck here for 12-18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>:
    *   Current customers are happy, but you're struggling to open the "demand floodgates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.
    *   Regretted churn is greater than 20% (a satisfaction warning sign) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.
    *   Sales cycles are too long, or you're losing deals late in the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. (Avoid a slow sales cycle with a low Average Contract Value (ACV) - this is the "quadrant of death") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.
    *   Customers lack urgency or struggle to hit your desired price point, saying things like "we don't have the budget" or "it's not the right time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. This means no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

*   **How to Get Unstuck**: Often requires a significant pivot, not just minor adjustments. Founders might hesitate to "throw away" what they've built, but it's crucial to be willing to let go and nail the Four Ps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.
    *   **Example: Looker** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>: Spent a long time at Level 1, with the founder providing extensive consulting (20-40 hours per customer) to model data and demonstrate value *before* they became customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. This "forward deploy process" was inefficient but led to high satisfaction and demand once customers saw their data in Looker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>. They then scaled rapidly through Level 2 with a 75% close rate and zero churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
    *   **Example: Ironclad** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>: Initially positioned as an "AI legal assistant," which was hard to sell because no one was looking for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. An inbound email asking "Are you a CLM?" led them to pivot their *Promise* and *Positioning* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>. By framing themselves as a "much better CLM" (Contract Lifecycle Management) within an existing category, they tapped into an existing buyer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>.

### Level 3: Strong Product Market Fit

This is where things "start to get fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>. The "rock is rolling down the hill," and leads are flowing in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>.

*   **Goal**: Achieve repeatability in your acquisition model, growing from 25 to 100+ customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Maintain high satisfaction and demand while actively improving **efficiency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   Team Size: 30 to 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.
    *   ARR: $5 million to $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.
    *   Demand Channel: Cracked at least one scalable marketing and sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>. At least 10% of inbound leads come from referrals and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>.
    *   Efficiency Metrics:
        *   Gross Margin: Above 60-70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>.
        *   Burn Multiple: Below 3x (ideally 1-3x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.
        *   Regretted Churn: Less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>.
        *   NRR: Greater than 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.

*   **Signs of Being Stuck (Yellow Flags)**: While a strong stage, new challenges emerge:
    *   A "leaky bucket" (NRR below 90% or regretted churn >10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.
    *   Growth is slowing (e.g., struggling to do 2x after prior 3x growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.
    *   Increased competition, requiring new strategies to navigate a tougher market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.
    *   Your first scalable channel is becoming saturated; you need to find new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.
    *   Growth requires excessive spending, pushing your burn multiple above 3x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.

### Level 4: Extreme Product Market Fit

Congratulations, you have built a valuable company, likely a unicorn, and are aiming for decacorn status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

*   **Goal**: Sustain growth by expanding Total Addressable Market (TAM) through new markets or multiple products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Continue excelling at satisfaction, demand, and efficiency across all products and markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   Team Size: Over 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.
    *   Customers: Over 100, scaling towards thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.
    *   ARR: $25 million and up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>.
    *   Efficiency Metrics: All strong.
        *   Sales Conversion (first call to close): >15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.
        *   Magic Number: >1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
        *   CAC Payback: <12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.
        *   Gross Margin: >80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.
        *   Burn Multiple: <1x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>.
        *   Churn: <10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
        *   NRR: >120% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:23">[01:03:23]</a>.

*   **Continuous Challenge**: Even at Level 4, the journey is never-ending. Market expectations continuously rise, and new products require finding [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] over and over again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.

## The Four Ps for Getting Unstuck

When you find yourself stuck at any level, especially Level 1 or 2, revisiting and potentially pivoting one or more of the "Four Ps" is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>:
1.  **Persona**: Who are you targeting? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a> This is akin to defining your market as a collection of people with problems and willingness to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>. Deeply understanding your persona, their challenges, and goals is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>.
2.  **Problem**: What specific problem are you solving for that persona? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a> The problem must be important and urgent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
3.  **Promise**: How are you positioning and describing your solution to that persona's problem? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a> This is the promise of the value you deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
4.  **Product**: The actual solution you are building to deliver on that promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. The product's job is to satisfy the first three Ps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.

### Dollar-Driven Customer Discovery

To effectively iterate on the Four Ps, especially Problem and Promise, conduct "dollar-driven customer discovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>. This goes beyond casual chats to test the monetary potential of a hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

*   **Identify Extreme Value**: Ask open-ended questions about their top goals and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>. Avoid "happy ears" (only hearing what supports your idea) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. Look for "wow" statements or demonstrated interest (e.g., asking for a follow-up meeting, requesting to share with colleagues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. If they say "that sounds kind of interesting," it's typically a polite "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.
*   **Confirm Ability to Pay**:
    *   "Are you currently looking for a product like this, or building something internally?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a> (Ideal customers have recognized the problem and sought/built solutions.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>
    *   "Where would a budget for this come from?" (Look for existing budgets that can be displaced.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>
    *   "How does your team make decisions on third-party tools?" (Understand their internal procurement process.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>
*   **Quantify Willingness to Pay**:
    *   "What's your budget for solving this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:59">[01:20:59]</a>
    *   "What are you paying for a similar/competing tool?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>
    *   Use the "Simon-Coe" pricing questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>:
        *   "What is a **fair price** you would pay for this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>
        *   "What would be an **expensive price**?" (This is often the price they would actually pay if the product is good) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:27">[01:21:27]</a>.
        *   "What would be a **prohibitively expensive price**?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:32">[01:21:32]</a>

## Overall Timelines and Odds of Success

*   **Level 1**: Ideally 12-18 months. This time is critical for picking the right Persona and Problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>.
*   **Level 2**: About 1 year to go from 5 to 25 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.
*   **Level 3**: Roughly 2 years to go from $5 million to $25 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>.
*   **Level 4**: Multiple years to scale beyond $25 million ARR, focusing on expanding TAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

The hard truth is that the majority of companies (60-70%) never get past Level 2 of [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. If a founder has been at it for four to five years and still isn't feeling market pull, it's a difficult decision, but there's no shame in considering a soft landing or returning money to investors, as [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] is incredibly challenging to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>.

Understanding these stages and the specific signs of being stuck can significantly increase a startup's odds of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>.

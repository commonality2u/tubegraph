Uri Levine, co-founder of Waze and nine other companies, has sold two companies for over a billion dollars and served on 20 startup boards, currently still on a dozen. He has also advised over 50 founders and startups [00:01:01]. His book, "Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution: A Handbook for Entrepreneurs," summarizes his career advice [00:01:14]. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, called the book a "Bible" for entrepreneurs [00:01:23].

## The Core Philosophy: Fall in Love with the Problem

Levine's biggest lesson from his extensive experience is to "fall in love with the problem" [00:00:07]. This philosophy serves as the North Star for the entrepreneurial journey, minimizing deviations and making the startup's story more compelling [00:04:12]. The simplest way to create value is to solve a problem [00:03:30]. When customers care about the problem being solved, they are more likely to help the startup succeed [00:04:48].

Founders should start by identifying a significant problem that, if solved, would make the world a better place [00:05:04]. If only one person has the problem, it might be better to seek a therapist than build a startup [00:05:16].

### Validating the Problem

To validate a problem, founders should speak with many people, especially those they don't know [00:09:41]. If 20 people confirm the problem's existence and offer their own descriptions of it, it's a good signal [00:10:15]. However, some successful products, like the iPhone, started without an existing "problem" but rather invented something entirely new [00:10:33].

### Passion for the Problem

It is crucial for founders to be personally passionate and "in love" with the problem [00:11:10]. The startup journey is "hard and complex and long" [00:11:27], requiring internal drive to navigate hardships [00:11:43]. A founder's passion helps engage others—employees, customers, and investors—to fall in love with the same problem and join the journey [00:11:56].

Levine's own frustration with traffic led him to co-found Waze [00:14:36]. Similarly, his frustration with "leaving money on the table" led to Overseas, a company that monitors airfare changes after booking [00:13:00].

### Pivoting Based on Problem Understanding

An example of a company pivoting due to a deeper understanding of the problem is Overseas [00:12:15]. Initially a B2C company aimed at helping individual travelers rebook cheaper flights, they found that while people cared, they were "not willing to take the action that is required" [00:13:10]. They pivoted to a B2B model, automatically rebooking flights for corporations, which saved companies about 10% on travel budgets [00:13:41].

## The Startup Journey: A Multi-Dimensional Path

The startup journey is characterized as:
*   **A Roller Coaster Journey:** It involves dramatic ups and downs with high frequency [00:15:36]. Ben Horovitz famously described it as sleeping "like a baby," waking up every two hours and crying [00:16:01].
*   **A Journey of Failures:** Building something new means frequent attempts that might not work [00:16:21].
    *   **Don't Be Afraid to Fail:** Fear of failure prevents trying new things, leading to an immediate failure [00:16:43].
    *   **[[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth | Fail Fast]]:** Failing quickly allows for more attempts and iterations, increasing the likelihood of success [00:17:11]. The goal is to be "good enough," not perfect, achieved through continuous iteration [00:17:51].
*   **A Long Journey:** It takes "very long, way longer than you think it is" [00:18:11]. The longest part is often figuring out product-market fit [00:19:10].

## Product-Market Fit

[[role_of_inflections_and_insights_in_startups | Product-market fit]] means creating value for customers [00:19:17]. Without it, a company "will die" [00:19:23]. Once achieved, companies typically don't change their core product significantly (e.g., Google search, Waze navigation) because the value proposition is established [00:20:06].

Achieving product-market fit takes time. For Waze, it was four years [00:20:29]. For Netflix, it was 10 years [00:20:35]. OpenAI's ChatGPT, while seemingly new, took six years to reach public awareness [00:20:44].

### The Metric of Product-Market Fit: Retention

The single most important metric for product-market fit is **retention** [01:01:04]. If users find value, they will return [01:01:06]. For high-frequency use products, a 3-month retention rate of 30-50% is a good indicator [01:01:04]. Users often "convert" and become loyal after their third or fourth use [01:01:07].

Waze's product-market fit journey involved extensive iteration [00:23:58]. Initially successful in Israel, it struggled globally [00:22:14]. By speaking with users about why the app wasn't "good enough" and iterating on their feedback, Waze gradually found product-market fit in specific metropolitan areas and countries [00:23:10]. Japan was an exception due to its unique chronological house numbering system, which made Waze's crowdsourced mapping model insufficient [00:24:44].

Waze also learned that its value proposition shifted from "avoiding traffic" to "creating certainty" about arrival times, which users valued more [00:28:50].

## Phases of a Startup

A startup progresses through distinct phases, and it's crucial to focus on "one thing at a time" [00:29:54].

1.  **Product-Market Fit Phase:** Initially, the sole focus is on figuring out product-market fit [00:30:38]. During this phase, sales, business development, and marketing are not needed; the focus should be on product and development to define and iterate the product until it's "good enough" [00:33:05].
2.  **Growth Phase:** Once product-market fit is achieved, the company shifts gears to figure out how to grow [00:33:32].
    *   **Word of Mouth:** This is ideal for high-frequency use products, as it naturally drives growth [00:32:28]. For example, Waze's growth was 95-99% driven by word-of-mouth [00:32:22]. However, products with low frequency of use (e.g., tax software) will have limited word-of-mouth growth [00:32:39].
    *   **Coolness:** Products perceived as "cool" (like early Airbnb) can also generate significant word-of-mouth, even with lower frequency of use [00:36:13].
3.  **Business Model Phase:** Figuring out the business model is also a journey of iteration and failures [00:31:33]. Waze, for instance, started with the idea of selling map data and traffic information but pivoted to advertisement [00:31:41]. If a company has a low frequency of use, it should prioritize figuring out its business model before focusing heavily on growth, as user acquisition will be a continuous effort [00:35:35].

This means focusing on the current phase's primary objective and avoiding distractions. Trying to do multiple things simultaneously leads to failure [00:34:39].

## [[fundraising_and_storytelling_for_startups | Fundraising]]

Fundraising is a "roller coaster journey in the dark" [00:41:03].

1.  **First Impressions are Key:** Investors decide quickly, sometimes "before they sit down" [00:41:56]. Therefore, the first slide of a presentation, which is displayed the longest, should present the startup's strongest point (e.g., market size, problem description, traction, team) [00:48:40]. Similarly, the last slide (e.g., "Thank You") should also repeat the strongest point [00:49:07].
2.  **Focus on the CEO and Story:** For early-stage investments, investors prioritize liking the CEO and the story being told [00:43:18]. The CEO should present alone to ensure the spotlight is on them, avoiding distractions [00:43:31].
3.  **Tell a Compelling Story:** A good story creates emotional engagement and makes the listener want to be part of it [00:44:07]. It should convey that the product is "usable" and "can be built" [00:44:22]. Starting with the problem is crucial, as investors are also users and need to feel its relevance [00:44:35]. Stories with specific details are perceived as more authentic and believable [00:52:49].
4.  **Expect Rejection:** The success rate for fundraising is very low. While customer sales might be 33%, investor "yeses" are about 1% [00:45:25]. Founders should anticipate hearing "no" 100 times before getting one "yes" [00:45:34]. Investors are not likely to change their minds once they've said no [00:47:04].
5.  **Be Prepared for Different Market Conditions:** The ease of raising capital fluctuates, influencing whether entrepreneurs are "choosers or beggars" [00:38:16].

## Hiring and Firing

Making hard decisions, especially firing, is crucial for a startup's survival [00:54:26]. Many failed startups attribute their demise to having the "wrong team" [00:54:47]. Often, founders knew an employee wasn't a good fit within the first month but delayed action [00:55:14].

> "The problem was not that the team was was not right the problem was that the co did not make hard decision." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>

### The 30-Day Rule

Every time a new person is hired, mark the calendar for 30 days later [00:57:02]. At that 30-day mark, ask one question: "Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person?" [00:57:11]
*   If **yes**: Celebrate their success, affirm their value, and consider more equity [00:57:26].
*   If **no**: Fire them immediately [00:57:41]. Continuing to employ someone who isn't a fit harms the individual, the team, and the company [00:57:48]. Top performers will leave if hard decisions are not made [00:55:50].

This "keeper test" is also used at companies like Netflix, where managers constantly ask if they would fight to keep an employee if they announced their departure [00:58:45].

When making these tough decisions, seeking confirmation from top-performing team members can be helpful by asking how they would feel if the person left [00:58:16].

### Hiring Best Practices

When interviewing candidates, always speak with references [01:02:57]. The most direct question to a reference is: "Would you hire him or would you hire her?" [01:03:11] A clear "yes" or "no" is desired [01:03:21]. If the answer is "yes," a follow-up question is, "Why didn't you?" [01:03:32]

## Understanding Users

Founders must understand that users may use products differently than intended [01:05:52]. It's crucial not to assume users are like the product builder [01:10:40].

### Observing User Behavior

Observe new users to see how they actually use the product [01:07:23]. If users aren't using the product as expected, ask "why" [01:07:29]. This "why" is key to making the product successful [01:07:36].

### User Adoption Groups

Users can be categorized into groups based on their willingness to adopt new behaviors:
1.  **Innovators (2%):** Use something because it's new and they care about the subject [01:08:16].
2.  **Early Adopters:** Try a product if they perceive value and will continue if it works [01:08:39].
3.  **Early Majority (1/3 of population):** The group that market leaders win [01:09:00]. This group is afraid of change and needs simplicity [01:09:12]. They fear complexity and feeling foolish [01:09:41].
4.  **Late Majority / Laggards:** Will only use a product if they absolutely have to [01:11:43].

To win the early majority, products must be simple [01:10:06]. This often means adding features until the core value is found, then removing unused features that add complexity [01:10:20].

### Speaking with Unsuccessful Users

Instead of just talking to successful users, talk to those who failed to complete the "funnel of use" [01:12:48]. These are users who downloaded but didn't register, registered but didn't use, or used but didn't come back [01:12:57]. They hold critical insights into "why" the product didn't work for them, which can lead to significant improvements [01:13:07].

## General Entrepreneurial Wisdom

*   **Don't be afraid to fail:** Failure is part of the journey and makes you stronger [01:14:30]. This applies to all aspects of life, including raising children [01:14:41].
*   **Embrace continuous learning:** Ask yourself regularly, "Knowing what I know today, would I do something different?" If the answer is yes, make a change immediately [01:00:12].
*   **Simplicity is sophistication:** The greatest complexity often hides true simplicity [01:10:06].
*   **The biggest enemy of good enough is perfect:** Strive for good enough to win the market, then iterate [01:17:51].

Uri Levine continues to work on new problems, including helping people retire richer, improving medical knowledge with [[role_of_ai_in_startups_and_entrepreneurship | AI]], and addressing inefficiencies in mobility, medical services, and education [01:18:25]. He believes that anything still done the same way as by previous generations needs revisiting [01:20:15].

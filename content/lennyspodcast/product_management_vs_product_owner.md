The [[product_management_in_tech_companies | Product Owner]] (PO) role is a distinct position within the technology ecosystem, differing significantly from the traditional [[role_of_product_managers | Product Manager]] (PM) role, especially in large, non-tech companies. While the PO role has seen rapid growth, it often operates in a "very different part of the tech ecosystem" than traditional product management [02:53:00].

### The Emergence of the Product Owner Role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>

The [[role_of_product_managers | Product Owner]] role did not emerge from product management as it is known today [00:23:00, 02:05:00]. Instead, it originated from the [[product_management_in_tech_companies | Scrum]] framework, which was developed by software developers to help development teams prioritize what to work on [00:28:00, 00:30:00, 01:10:00].

*   **Agile Manifesto (2001)**: The Agile movement began in 2001 when a group of software developers created the Agile Manifesto, focusing on improving software development [01:05:00]. Notably, no product managers were present at this meeting [01:08:00].
*   **Scrum Guide**: Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland codified Scrum, outlining roles such as developers, [[role_of_product_managers | Product Owners]], and [[the_emerging_role_of_product_operations_and_its_impact_on_scaling_product_management | Scrum Masters]] [01:19:00, 01:31:00].
    *   **Early Definition**: The first Scrum Guide stated that the [[role_of_product_managers | Product Owner]] is "responsible for maximizing the value of work done" [01:11:00]. It also suggested that for "commercial development, the product owner may be the product manager" or for "in-house development efforts, the product owner could be the user department manager" [01:52:00, 01:57:00].
    *   **Later Versions**: The 2013 version of the Scrum Guide, which many companies use for Agile transformations, removed the suggestion that a [[role_of_product_managers | Product Manager]] could be a [[role_of_product_managers | Product Owner]] [01:09:00, 01:17:00].
*   **Purpose**: The [[role_of_product_managers | Product Owner]] role was primarily "a way to help the developers prioritize what to work on" [02:10:00]. This involved defining backlog items, writing user stories, and prioritizing for developers [01:26:00, 01:48:00]. Developers could then claim they "didn't build it wrong" if the product owner told them what to build [02:30:00, 02:33:00].

### Product Management in Tech Companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>

In contrast, [[product_management_in_tech_companies | Product Managers]] in software-native companies (e.g., Google, Amazon) are born out of a business role where software *is* the business [01:11:00, 01:16:00]. They perform end-to-end product management, including market research, talking to customers, working with developers, and iterating [01:22:00, 01:28:00]. Top tech companies typically do not have a [[role_of_product_managers | Product Owner]] role; they primarily employ [[role_of_product_managers | Product Managers]] [02:21:00, 02:29:00].

### The Growth of the Product Owner Role and [[challenges_and_opportunities_of_being_a_product_manager | Challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>

The [[role_of_product_managers | Product Owner]] role has become the third fastest-growing role in US tech [02:34:00]. This growth is largely seen in traditional, non-tech companies such as banks, insurance, and pharmaceutical companies, which historically did not build software [01:48:00, 02:39:00, 03:55:00]. These companies turn to frameworks like [[product_management_theater | Scrum]] and [[product_management_theater | SAFe]] to implement "rigor at scale" and improve their software development [02:45:00, 03:36:00].

#### [[product_management_theater | Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>

[[product_management_theater | SAFe]] is a popular framework designed to scale [[product_management_theater | Scrum]] and other processes across large organizations [02:36:00, 02:41:00]. It provides a prescriptive operating model, which appeals to executives in large enterprises because it offers a "map" and a "handbook" for software development [03:44:00, 03:56:00].

*   **Role Separation in SAFe**:
    *   **[[role_of_product_managers | Product Owner]]**: In [[product_management_theater | SAFe]], the [[role_of_product_managers | Product Owner]] is part of the Agile team (developers, [[the_emerging_role_of_product_operations_and_its_impact_on_scaling_product_management | Scrum Masters]]) [02:27:00, 02:28:00]. Their primary task is to maintain full backlogs for developers by writing user stories, often without customer interaction, acting as "order takers" [02:42:00, 03:12:00, 03:37:00].
    *   **[[role_of_product_managers | Product Manager]]**: The [[role_of_product_managers | Product Manager]] in [[product_management_theater | SAFe]] typically sits at a higher level, working with system architects and release train engineers, focusing on portfolio visions and "Big Room Planning" [02:35:00, 03:06:00].
*   **[[product_management_misconceptions | Criticisms of SAFe]]**:
    *   **Overhead and Rigidity**: [[product_management_theater | SAFe]] is considered "Overkill" and can be too rigid, leading to "work about work" instead of focusing on customer value [03:12:00, 03:50:00, 05:06:00, 05:17:00].
    *   **Lack of Discovery**: It often fails to integrate proper discovery practices like market research, experimentation, and customer feedback, as POs are not trained in these areas and PMs are disconnected from the day-to-day [01:55:00, 03:26:00, 03:59:00, 04:47:00].
    *   **Career Path Limitations**: The separation of roles in [[product_management_theater | SAFe]] can limit the [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_managers | career development for product owners and managers]] to become more strategic, as they don't gain experience in market research or customer interaction [03:42:00, 03:50:00]. Many organizations lack a clear [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_managers | career path]] for POs [04:50:00, 04:52:00].
    *   **Inefficiency**: The model can lead to developers becoming "reliant on the product manager or product owner to tell them what to do," hindering self-organization and problem-solving [03:47:00, 03:51:00].
*   **Companies Moving Away**: Some companies, like Capital One, have adopted and then moved away from [[product_management_theater | SAFe]] and other Agile roles [03:05:00, 03:09:00].

### [[improving_product_management_skills | Recommendations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>

#### For Companies and Leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>

*   **Don't Recommend SAFe**: [[product_management_theater | SAFe]] is generally not recommended as a "plug and play" solution [04:17:00, 04:21:00]. While it can bring rigor, it doesn't solve core [[product_management_in_tech_companies | product management]] problems like connecting value to product teams [04:40:00, 04:42:00].
*   **Develop a Product Operating Model**: Focus on developing a comprehensive operating model that includes product strategy, organizational design, [[the_emerging_role_of_product_operations_and_its_impact_on_scaling_product_management | product operations]] (infrastructure, data, customer access), and appropriate culture and incentives (rewarding value over just shipping features) [04:51:00, 05:01:00].
*   **Prioritize Product Strategy**: Many large organizations lack a strong product strategy that ties back to company goals and customer value [04:19:00, 04:30:00]. Software strategy should be a C-suite concern to drive innovation [02:21:00].
*   **Invest in Talent**: Leaders should hire experienced product people into leadership roles to guide transformations and mentor internal talent [05:37:00, 05:40:00].
*   **Embrace Agile Principles**: Focus on the core principles of Agile: moving quickly, delivering value, and getting feedback from customers. Be willing to "inspect and adapt" processes that are not serving the company's best interest [01:52:00, 04:47:00, 05:50:00, 07:07:00].

#### For Product Owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>

*   **Expand Your Role**: Understand that the [[role_of_product_managers | Product Owner]] role can be more than just working with developers. Seek opportunities to engage in customer research, test hypotheses, and understand the market [05:16:00, 05:57:00, 05:59:00].
*   **Challenge the Status Quo**: Proactively question leaders about your [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_managers | career path]] and push back on tasks that solely focus on "order-taking" [05:47:00, 05:50:00, 05:53:00, 05:57:00, 01:11:00, 01:14:00].
*   **Focus on Outcomes**: Frame your work and discussions around the value delivered and metrics achieved rather than just process adherence (e.g., "What do we hope will happen when we release this? What metrics are we going to change?") [05:57:00, 01:00:00].
*   **Resum√© Advice**: When seeking a new role, particularly in tech companies, describe your experience from a value and outcome perspective, focusing on "what value you brought to the users and what metrics you moved" [01:03:00, 01:06:00]. Avoid focusing on Agile ceremonies or Scrum cadences [01:03:00, 01:31:00]. Consider listing your role as "Product Owner/Product Manager" on your resume to indicate broader skills [01:06:00, 01:10:00].
*   **Certifications**: While certifications like "Certified Scrum Product Owner" (CSPO) may help secure roles in organizations adopting Scrum, they are generally not valued by top tech companies looking for [[product_management_in_tech_companies | product management]] experience [01:44:00, 01:50:00, 01:53:00, 02:07:00]. True [[improving_product_management_skills | product management skills]] are developed through practice and exposure, not just short classes [01:44:00, 01:50:00, 01:55:00].
*   **Seek Mentorship**: Find leaders who understand and practice good [[product_management_in_tech_companies | product management]] and try to work for them or learn from them [01:06:00, 01:07:00].

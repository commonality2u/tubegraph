## Understanding B2B Sales

In B2B, sales is fundamentally about solving problems, not merely selling commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. The role of a sales representative in SaaS is to act as an expert, helping prospects understand how a product like a Tesla Model 3 Performance addresses their specific needs, being honest about its limitations, and guiding them through the decision process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. Top sales professionals are confident enough to tell a prospect when their product is not the right solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

## When to Hire Your First Salesperson

### Founder-Led Sales

Founders, even if they dislike sales, must first close the initial 10 to 20 customers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. This period allows founders to become "A+ middlers" – proficient at discussing the product and market, even if they struggle with initiation or closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Customers often prefer interacting directly with the CEO in the early stages, as founders possess deep product and market knowledge that sales reps from larger companies may lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

### Signs It's Time to Hire

It's time to hire your first salesperson when:
*   You have successfully closed your first 10 unaffiliated customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   More than 20% of your time is spent on sales activities, indicating a need for leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   You have established a repeatable sales process that can be taught to new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

Ignoring the need for a sales team, especially if your initial customers require sales engagement, can lead to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Many companies, even those starting with a product-led growth (PLG) motion like Slack or Canva, eventually transition to or incorporate a sales-led approach as they scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Recruiting Your First Sales Hires

### Hire Two Reps

Always hire two salespeople initially, not just one. This allows for A/B testing of humans and provides a basis for comparison, which is crucial for understanding what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

### Key Qualities to Look For

Interview at least 30 candidates to find the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Your first hires should be:
*   **Someone you would buy your own product from** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. They should understand your product and your customers' problems in a believable way, even if their background is unconventional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **"Quirky pirates and romantics"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. These individuals possess a few extra IQ points and have genuinely fallen in love with your product, despite its early-stage limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   **Experienced and mature.** They should have a couple of years of B2B sales experience and enough maturity to be trusted with precious early leads and customer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   **Someone whose last product was *harder* to sell** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>. This ensures they have developed robust sales skills and will find your product relatively easier to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. Look for experience in more competitive or technically complex spaces, or from a company ranked lower in its market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

Avoid hiring based solely on impressive company logos on a resume if the candidate lacks the core ability to sell *your* product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### Interviewing Strategies

*   **"Sell me this app" test:** Ask candidates to sell your product to you. Give them time to prepare, expecting them to have researched your product through explainer videos, webinars, and customer testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. If they haven't put in this basic effort, it's a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.
*   **Reference checks:** Do not skip reference checks, as they provide critical insights into a candidate's past performance and fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

### Sales Compensation and Quota

*   **Pay market rate:** A typical split is 50% base salary and 50% bonus (On-Target Earnings, OTE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. Founders often overthink the OTE, but the actual cash commitment for a few months is usually manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.
*   **Early ramp-up:** For the first one to three months (maximum one quarter), allow new reps to keep 100% of what they close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>. This helps them put "points on the board" and gain confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.
*   **Long-term goal:** A sales rep should ultimately bring in three to five times what they take home in compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. If they achieve this, they are accretive to the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>.
*   **Don't over-negotiate:** Small differences in OTE won't impact long-term success as much as a rep's ability to close large deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   **Welcome high earners:** Don't be upset if a sales rep makes more than founders in the early days; it means they are generating significant revenue, increasing the company's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

## Bringing on a VP of Sales

### Timing the Hire

A common [[mistakes_founders_make_in_building_sales_teams | mistake Founders make]] is hiring a VP of Sales too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. You should only hire a VP of Sales after you have two sales reps consistently hitting quota and closing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Hiring before this stage is "mission impossible" and has a near 100% chance of failure, leading to wasted capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

### Role and Involvement

A VP of Sales' primary job is to scale the sales team from a handful of reps (e.g., three) to hundreds, building repeatable processes and managing a larger, more diverse team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **Must be product-savvy:** Early sales teams, including the VP of Sales, must be product gurus and experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. A VP who doesn't understand the product will fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
*   **Actively involved in deals:** The VP of Sales should carry a "bag" (close deals themselves) or be deeply involved in sales calls 20-30 hours per week, especially in today's market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. Avoid VPs who only want to manage and have no interest in actively selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **Desire to sell:** Look for a Head of Sales who genuinely loves the craft of selling, honing scripts, beating competitors, and working on a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. They must also like money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.
*   **Interview question:** Ask "What do you want to do your first 14 days?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. A good answer involves meeting customers or joining sales calls; a red flag is focusing solely on "process" or "territory planning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

### The "Stretch VP"

For 95% of companies, the first Head of Sales should be a "stretch VP" – someone who was previously a director or senior director and is taking a step up in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. Avoid seasoned VPs who might be burnt out and unwilling to put in the direct selling effort required at an early-stage company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>. A stretch VP's ability to source and hire capable managers under them will determine their long-term success and the company's ability to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

## Scaling the Sales Organization

### Organizational Structure: Rules of Eight

In sales, there are "rules of eight" for scaling:
*   Eight Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) need one manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   Eight Account Executives (AEs) need one director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.
*   A good VP of Sales will proactively seek to hire two directors once they have eight AE reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>.
This structure helps maintain efficiency and management oversight in a sales-led motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.

### Sales Roles and Titles

*   **Sales Development Representative (SDR):** Typically an entry-level position (60k-80k OTE in US SaaS), focused on outbound emailing and calling ("email for dollars, dial for dollars") to generate leads and screen inbound inquiries. Their job is to pass qualified leads to Account Executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>.
*   **Account Executive (AE):** More seasoned sales professionals (90k-200k OTE in US SaaS, 50/50 base/bonus split) responsible for working and closing leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>. Most AEs prefer to be handed leads rather than generate their own outbound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.
*   **Director of Sales:** Manages a team of Account Executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.
*   **VP of Sales:** Oversees the entire sales organization, responsible for strategy and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

It's a common [[mistakes_founders_make_in_building_sales_teams | mistake that Founders make]] to hire the number one Account Executive to be their Head of Sales; individual contributor skills do not always translate to management skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.

## Product and Sales Synergy

### Product's Involvement in Sales

In well-run B2B organizations, the Head of Product (or VP of Product) should be deeply involved in sales, particularly for large or strategic deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. Their deep product knowledge and authority allow them to make commitments, address customer concerns, and navigate complex integrations, which sales reps often cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>.

### Managing Sales Feature Requests

Stress and tension between product and sales are natural in a well-run B2B company, indicating active deal flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. To manage this effectively:
*   **Allocate a budget:** Give the Head of Sales a specific budget (e.g., 10% of story points) for product features each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>.
*   **Force rank priorities:** Require the sales team to force-rank their feature requests within their allocated budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>.
*   **Weekly stakeholder meetings:** The VP of Sales and VP of Product should have weekly meetings to discuss feature priorities and roadmap planning, ensuring clear communication and preventing disruption to engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.
*   **Empowerment of leadership:** Individual contributors (PMs or AEs) should push critical decisions up to their respective VPs for resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>.

## General Advice for Founders and Product Leaders

### Continuous Improvement in Sales

*   **Master the "next step":** Founders and product leaders should learn to always ask for the next step at the end of every meeting, whether it's another demo, a meeting with another stakeholder, or a step towards signing a contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>.
*   **Educational resources:** For learning more about sales, consider Saster University (free, saster.com) and the book "From Impossible to Inevitable" by Aaron Ross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>. For networking, Pavilion is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:43">[01:30:43]</a>.

### Customer-Centric Approach

*   **Trial length:** Be cautious of short trial lengths (e.g., 14 days) driven by sales teams' desire to close deals quickly, rather than genuine customer benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>. Products like Slack and Canva thrived with infinite or very long free trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>.
*   **Contract terms:** Avoid forcing customers into annual contracts if they prefer monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>. Product leaders should be the "voice of the customer" and push for flexible payment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>.
*   **Earn price increases:** If you increase prices, ensure you have delivered substantially more value to your product to justify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>.
*   **Analyze losses:** Spend more time analyzing lost deals than won deals to learn from failures and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>.

### The Power of "Free"

*   **Free products are better software:** Products that offer a free edition or extended free trial often lead to better overall software, as they are designed for self-onboarding and immediate value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.
*   **Advocacy:** Even if they don't immediately convert, a large "free" user base acts as advocates and fuels compounding revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>. Founders and product leaders must champion the "VP of Free" concept to protect the long-term value of these relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:16">[01:32:16]</a>.

This year should be the "year of the customer," where product teams lead by making customers happier and shipping genuinely great products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

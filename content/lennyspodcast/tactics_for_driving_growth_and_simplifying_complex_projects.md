From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 
Naomi Gleit, Head of Product at Meta and its longest-serving executive besides Mark Zuckerberg, has been instrumental in the company's journey from a small startup to a global powerhouse. Her career at Meta (formerly Facebook) began as employee number 29, spanning almost 20 years, during which she has contributed to its scale from 30 employees to a $1.5 trillion business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Gleit is renowned for her ability to [[importance_of_simplification_and_prioritization_in_product_management | simplify complex problems]] and drive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Tactics for Driving Growth

Naomi Gleit was part of Facebook's early and legendary [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth team]], which pioneered many core growth levers and techniques now widely used in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

### The "7 Friends in 10 Days" Metric
A legendary activation metric for Facebook was getting users to have "seven friends in 10 days" (or "10 friends in 14 days") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. This metric was chosen because it mapped to a point on the retention curve where a user's likelihood of being retained significantly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. The primary value of such a specific activation milestone was providing [[effective_growth_frameworks | extreme clarity]] and a rallying point for the entire team to optimize towards a shared goal, rather than the precise numbers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.

### Shifting Focus from Acquisition to Retention
Initially, the growth team focused heavily on acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. However, using a "growth accounting" framework (new users - stale users + resurrected users) revealed that churn and resurrection lines were much larger than the new user line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This led to a significant shift in focus towards engagement and retention, recognizing they were the biggest levers for net growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

### Product as the Core Growth Lever
Historically, user growth was often attributed to marketing or communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. The Facebook growth team pioneered the insight that the *product* itself is the biggest lever to drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. This meant having a product and engineering team dedicated to optimizing areas like:
*   Registration flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>
*   Invite flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>
*   New user onboarding, focused on getting users to the "magic moment" quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>

### The "Understand, Identify, Execute" Framework
This framework, developed in 2009, emphasizes:
1.  **Understand**: Rigorously instrumenting data to know where users drop off and what drives growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
2.  **Identify**: Pinpointing key opportunities based on data, e.g., increasing friending in the new user experience or addressing email confirmation drop-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
3.  **Execute**: Building products to address identified opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

### Removing Barriers to Growth
Naomi identifies two types of barriers the growth team focused on:
*   **Macro Barriers**: Broad limitations to who can use the product, such as initial restrictions to college students, then high school, work networks, and eventually anyone with an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. This also included making Facebook accessible on feature phones or via initiatives like internet.org to address internet access or data plan affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. The localization strategy using community translation for 100+ languages is another example of removing a macro barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.
*   **Micro Barriers**: Small points of friction within the product flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. For instance, addressing a 20% drop-off at the email confirmation step by allowing notifications for unconfirmed accounts and counting clicks on any notification as account confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

## Simplifying Complex Projects

Naomi Gleit is known for her ability to take "really complex and gnarly problems and projects simplifying them and delivering results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

### The PM as a Conductor
Naomi views a Product Manager (PM) as a conductor of an orchestra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>. The team is an orchestra with various functions (legal, policy, comms, data analytics, engineering, design) that must play their part correctly and in unison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. The PM's job is to ensure harmony, sync, and the right tempo, not to be the star of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.

### Driving [[importance_of_simplification_and_prioritization_in_product_management | Extreme Clarity]]
Extreme Clarity ensures everyone is on the same page, even if they disagree, by having a shared understanding of the facts, options, and trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

Tactics for Extreme Clarity:
*   **Canonical Nomenclature**: Create a shared vocabulary by explicitly defining terms to prevent miscommunication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
*   **Visuals in Meetings**: Use visuals (e.g., slides) in meetings and real-time edit them to document decisions and next steps, ensuring everyone sees and agrees on the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.
*   **Numbered Lists**: Use numbered lists instead of bullet points so specific items can be easily referenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Canonical Docs**: For every project, there should be one canonical document that contains all essential information and links to other relevant documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>. This document should include:
    *   Discrete workstreams and their single-threaded owners (formerly called "directly responsible individuals" or DRIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.
    *   The canonical process for team collaboration, including canonical meetings, email lists, and chat groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.
    *   Canonical visuals of frameworks or project structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.

### Deconstructing Complexity
When joining a complex project, Naomi approaches it from a "kindergarten level" to understand the most basic building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. This involves creating a "school pyramid" curriculum that builds from basic concepts to elementary, high school, college, and finally PhD-level understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. This process of [[managing_change_and_maintaining_momentum_in_product_development | simplification]] often reveals the most important issues to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.

### Perfect Execution and Problem Root Cause
Gleit believes that 80% of project issues stem from "people or process" rather than "strategy or execution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. She emphasizes achieving "perfect execution" first because only then can one accurately re-evaluate whether the strategy is right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.

### Effective Meeting Management
Naomi emphasizes strict meeting hygiene to ensure productivity and clarity:
*   **Pre-reads and Agendas**: Send a pre-read and agenda 24 hours before the meeting. Some leaders will cancel a meeting if the pre-read isn't provided in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>.
*   **Focus on Decisions**: Meetings should primarily be for making decisions, requiring three options and a recommendation for each decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.
*   **Traffic Light Evaluation**: When presenting options, use a "traffic light" table format with columns for criteria (e.g., legal, policy, privacy, user experience, engineering feasibility) and rows for options. Color-code cells (red, yellow, green) to visually represent how each option stacks up against the criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
*   **Real-time Editing**: Edit the projected visual in real-time to document decisions and next steps during the meeting, ensuring immediate shared understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>.
*   **Post-Meeting Notes**: Send notes (including decisions and next steps) via "reply all" to the calendar invite within 24 hours after the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>.

### Personal Effectiveness
Naomi attributes her effectiveness to four "must-haves": eat, sleep, alone time, and exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>. She prioritizes exercise daily for its physical benefits, but more importantly, for its mental health advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:39">[01:14:39]</a>. Setting specific goals, like doing five pull-ups, builds confidence that translates into other areas of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

To develop a strong "first-party perspective" as a PM, Naomi dedicates two-to-three-hour blocks of time for focused thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a>. This time can be used for solitary thought or for bouncing ideas off one or two trusted sparring partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:17">[01:25:17]</a>.Naomi Gleit, Head of Product at Meta and its longest-serving executive besides Mark Zuckerberg, has been instrumental in the company's journey from a small startup to a global powerhouse.

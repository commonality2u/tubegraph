The [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | Role of Product Managers]] in Owning the "Why"

At Figma, a core philosophy regarding [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product managers]] is their unique [[the_role_of_ownership_and_responsibility_in_product_management | ownership and responsibility]] for the "why" behind a product or idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. While the "what" (the idea itself) and the "how" (its implementation) are often shared responsibilities across a company, the "why" remains the distinct domain of the product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

## Scaling Product Development Through Shared Understanding
This emphasis on the "why" stemmed from experiences in larger organizations like YouTube and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. In contrast to a culture like Microsoft's, where [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product managers]] meticulously wrote specs to define *exactly* how everything should work for a small feature crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, at YouTube, managing an entire app with a large team meant it was impossible for one person to specify every detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

In such an environment, designers and engineers inevitably make their own choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. The key to ensuring these local [[decision_making_in_product_management | decisions]] are sound is for everyone to understand *why* a particular action is being taken and *what problem* is being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. This shared understanding of the "why" is the only way to effectively scale product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

## Uncovering Root Causes
The concept of delving into the "why" is also reflected in practices like the "five whys" used by Figma's engineering team during retrospectives and postmortems to identify root causes of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. A [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product manager]] can apply this similar line of questioning to customer requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>:
1.  A customer asks for a feature.
2.  *Why* are they asking for it? (To understand the immediate problem) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>
3.  *Why* do they have that problem in the first place? (To uncover the underlying condition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>

By identifying and addressing these underlying conditions, [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product managers]] can achieve a bigger product impact than by simply fulfilling feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. This deep understanding of the "why" enables [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product managers]] to effectively [[developing_and_communicating_a_product_vision | develop and communicate a clear product vision]] and strategy.

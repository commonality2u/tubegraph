[[First principles thinking]] is a foundational approach championed by Shopify CEO, Toby Lütke, focusing on deconstructing problems to their core truths rather than reasoning by analogy or convention. This method is deeply embedded in Shopify's culture and operations, influencing everything from product development to organizational structure.

## What is First Principles Thinking?

Toby Lütke views the world as "unbelievably path dependent," meaning existing solutions and products are often constrained by historical compromises and conditions that may no longer be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:53">[03:59:53]</a>. [[First principles thinking]] involves deriving solutions from fundamental building blocks, asking how a problem would be solved given all currently available resources, rather than simply making a "good version" of an existing solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:10">[03:10:10]</a>. This approach necessitates understanding the "atomic building blocks" of a problem, such as the underlying physics or computer code, to avoid being led astray by superficial aesthetics or conventional wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:12">[05:01:12]</a>.

## Contrasting with Conventional Approaches

Lütke notes a prevalent aesthetic in business where "pessimism sounds extremely sophisticated" while "optimism always sounds dumb or at least naive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:56">[02:53:56]</a>. He actively rejects this, finding that "almost all the alpha in the world is now in the exactly the things that are unobvious but true and the things that people dismiss as naive or absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:27">[02:47:27]</a>.

A core tenet of [[first principles thinking]] is to default to *not* doing something the way most people are doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. This is because to achieve "world class" results, one cannot simply mimic existing methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:42">[03:11:42]</a>.

### Goodhart's Law and Overfitting
A significant challenge in traditional business is the tendency to "overfit" to quantifiable metrics, a phenomenon known as [[Goodhart's law]], which states that "any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a good metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:56">[01:44:56]</a>. Lütke equates this to "overfitting" in machine learning, where a model learns to "cheat on the benchmark" instead of predicting the actual desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. Shopify largely operates without specific KPIs or OKRs, instead focusing on [[unquantifiable things in business | unquantifiable things]] like taste, quality, passion, fun, and delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:59">[01:57:59]</a>. While they are "extremely data informed," data serves as a "cockpit for a pilot," with decisions ultimately made by human judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:18">[02:08:18]</a>.

## Toby's "Algorithm" for First Principles Thinking

While Toby states his brain operates on a "meta-language" that's hard to translate into a simple algorithm, several recurring themes describe his approach to [[first principles thinking]]:

1.  **Dissatisfaction with the Status Quo**
    Lütke's primary "energy source" is dissatisfaction with the status quo, viewing the present as the "dystopia of the future" that must be improved through building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This fuels a continuous drive to build for progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:27">[02:47:27]</a>.

2.  **Future Casting and 100-Year Vision**
    He often employs "future casting," asking what future selves would want to have done today, and operates with a [[the_working_backwards_process_in_product_development | 100-year vision]] for Shopify's product and mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>. This long-term perspective influences decisions by prioritizing "long-term valuable" outcomes, such as making entrepreneurship more common, over short-term financial gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.

3.  **"Toby Tornado" and Ignoring Sunk Costs**
    The "Toby Tornado" describes Lütke's rapid, decisive "change management" where projects deemed unproductive are swiftly stopped to prevent "wasting time" on something that won't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This practice, while potentially "whiplashy," prioritizes what is "best" and avoids the [[Secondorder thinking and philosophical approaches in business | sunk cost fallacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

4.  **Being "Close to the Metal"**
    Lütke stresses the importance of being deeply immersed in the "atomic building blocks" of the technology, such as writing code himself, to truly understand how things work and inform decisions from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:50">[05:09:50]</a>.

5.  **Seeking Disagreement and Debugging Assumptions**
    Lütke actively invites disagreement, viewing it as a valuable opportunity to uncover "unstated foundational assumptions" that might be incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:58">[05:00:58]</a>. He may even play "devil's advocate" to challenge proposals that seem too predictable or uninspired, forcing deeper arguments for their validity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:32">[05:31:32]</a>.

6.  **Lowering Complexity to Unlock Potential**
    Shopify's mission to make entrepreneurship more common is achieved by "taming enormous complexity with great UX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>. By making complex tasks (like taxes or payments) simpler and even automatic, Shopify removes obstacles that might otherwise deter aspiring entrepreneurs, allowing more businesses to exist and thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

7.  **Playing the "Positional Game" in Business**
    Lütke likens business to chess, distinguishing between "tactics" (short-term gains, like A/B testing button colors) and the "positional game" (long-term strategic territory, trust, and deep reliance from customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. While tactics are necessary to "not go out of business," the true value lies in the positional game, which involves patient, long-term investments and playing "positive sum games" with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. This aligns with the concept of [[Secondorder thinking and philosophical approaches in business | infinite games]] from James Carse, where the goal is to continue playing, not to win a finite objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.

## Examples of First Principles Thinking in Action

*   **Shopify's Genesis:** Instead of creating complex e-commerce software for existing large retailers, Lütke optimized for making it easy to start *new* online businesses, challenging the "path dependence" of existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:14">[03:36:14]</a>.
*   **Remote-First Decision during COVID-19:** When the fundamental "Boolean" of whether people were allowed to leave their homes changed, Shopify reran its "foundational assumptions" about work, quickly shifting to a remote-only model, understanding that this would be the "optimal" set of trade-offs for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:53">[03:52:53]</a>.
*   **Partnership with Stripe:** The long-term, highly valuable partnership with Stripe was built on the assumption that both companies would "win our markets" and collaborate, consistently choosing coordination over defection in an "iterated prisoners dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>. This "corporate marshmallow test" allows for greater value creation over long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.
*   **Instagram's "Try Run" Feature:** Lütke praises Instagram's "try run" feature for Reels, which allows users to test content with a small audience before public posting. He sees this as a profound piece of software because it "lowers the net amount of courage needed" for creation, a key barrier to human potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:08">[01:26:08]</a>.

## Conclusion: Maximizing Potential and Courage

Ultimately, [[first principles thinking]] at Shopify is deeply intertwined with [[importance_of_selfawareness_and_personal_operating_principles | maximizing human potential]]. Lütke believes no one is near their maximum potential and that an environment that reminds people of this constantly, holding them to a high standard, leads to unexpected accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. He encourages individuals to think of themselves as "products" or "Talent as a Service," building a [[talent_stack]] of unique and valuable skills that allow them to be "too good to ignore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:06">[01:35:06]</a>. This focus on building "amazing things for some people" rather than something "everyone wants or would tolerate" helps individuals find their unique "triplicate intersection" of talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>.

For product leaders, Lütke stresses that the quality of a product is a direct reflection of how much the creators "gave a sh*t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:19">[01:37:19]</a>. A product leader must be "exothermically infectious" with their care and "look around corners" by understanding the underlying details and leveraging their team's knowledge, embodying a true [[founder_mode_in_product_leadership | founder mode]] of pumping heat into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.

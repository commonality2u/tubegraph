Nikita Beer, a seasoned app developer who has launched multiple apps to the top of the App Store, including TBH and Gas, shares his insights on what it takes to achieve viral growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:54">[02:05:54]</a>.

## Early Experiences and Pivots

Before the widespread success of TBH and Gas, Beer spent years experimenting with various apps, learning what truly drives user adoption and retention. His first product, Potify, a web app designed to help voters understand the financial impact of political policies, went "super viral" with four million users during an election season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:56">[07:39:56]</a>. This early success highlighted his competency in making things go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:05">[08:58:05]</a>.

After a challenging experience selling software to governments, Beer pivoted his focus to consumer apps, leading to the creation of Midnight Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:04">[13:27:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:40">[13:31:40]</a>. Over four to five years, his team built about 15 different mobile applications, including mapping apps, chat apps, and event meetup apps, which helped them develop a "muscle to understand what people want and how to actually make things grow and how to test them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:04">[10:34:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:50">[15:51:50]</a>.

## Targeting Teens for Viral Growth

A critical insight gained from these experiments was the importance of targeting teenagers for organic, viral growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:04">[10:47:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:44">[15:10:44]</a>:
*   **Malleable Habits**: Teenagers' habits are more "malleable" compared to adults, who tend to be fixed in their use of communication products and less likely to adopt new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:04">[10:55:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:04">[10:59:04]</a>.
*   **Invitation Behavior**: As users get older, the number of people they invite to new apps declines almost exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:58">[11:13:58]</a>. Beer observed that for every social app he built, the number of invitations sent per user drops 20% for every additional year of age from 13 to 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:04">[11:58:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:04">[12:05:04]</a>.
*   **Daily Interaction**: Teens often see each other every day, which is crucial for the spread of social apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:04">[11:28:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:04">[11:29:04]</a>.
*   **Network Effects**: If a product aims for network effects as a communication tool, it should target the cohort with the highest urgency to communicate and add connections to their social graph, which are teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:04">[18:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:04">[18:21:04]</a>. Building for adults often requires significant venture capital for user acquisition through ads and makes achieving network effects unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:04">[12:27:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:04">[16:57:04]</a>.

## TBH: A Case Study in Viral Success

TBH, a positive-only anonymous polling app for teens, went viral, demonstrating several [[Growth Hacking and Strategies|growth strategies]]:
*   **Latent Demand**: The insight for TBH came from observing existing behaviors like the popularity of Saraha (an anonymous messaging app that was #1 in the US despite being entirely in Arabic) and a Snapchat game where teens gave positive feedback using emojis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:04">[26:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:04">[26:19:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:04">[26:32:04]</a>. This indicated a strong, unfulfilled desire for positive disclosure among teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:04">[26:40:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:04">[27:26:04]</a>. The strategy is to "crystallize what their motivation is and build a product around and and clear up what they're trying to actually do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:04">[26:54:04]</a>.
*   **Positive-Only Feedback**: TBH's core mechanic involved answering polls that were always positive, ensuring users received only compliments and avoided bullying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:04">[27:46:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:04">[28:07:04]</a>. This made users feel better and led to a much higher volume of messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:04">[28:22:04]</a>. For example, one school sent 450,000 messages in the first seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:33:04">[28:33:04]</a>. The app even included a system to ensure everyone received a vote by increasing frequency of names in polls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Reproducible Testing Process**: The team developed a process to seed apps into schools and affinity groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:04">[19:11:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:04">[19:36:04]</a>. For TBH, they targeted a school with the earliest start date in Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:04">[21:14:04]</a>.
*   **Saturating an Area**: To kickstart adoption and achieve density, they used targeted ads and a dedicated Instagram account for the school, following students whose bios identified their school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:04">[30:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14:04">[30:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:04">[30:28:04]</a>. This initial seeding allowed them to know if the product was working and had "legs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:04">[30:58:04]</a>.
*   **Immediate User Feedback**: Implementing 24/7 live chat customer support helped get immediate feedback, identify user problems, and make users feel valued, encouraging positive word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:45:04">[32:45:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:09:04">[33:09:04]</a>.
*   **Recognizing Product-Market Fit**: When a product achieves product-market fit, it's evident; things start breaking because of explosive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:55:04">[35:55:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:04">[36:01:04]</a>. TBH's servers crashed, and the team had to geofence the app to control growth and scale servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:04">[21:39:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:04">[28:56:04]</a>. Metrics like "hourly actives per day" emerged as key indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:43:04">[36:43:04]</a>.

## Challenges of Rapid Growth

Rapid viral growth brings its own set of [[Challenges and strategies for creating successful startups|challenges]]:
*   **Chaos and Prioritization**: "It is absolute chaos to keep the thing online" when it scales rapidly, with systems breaking and needing replacement every few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:04">[35:10:04]</a>. Ruthless prioritization of the largest fires is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:04">[35:20:04]</a>.
*   **Misinformation Hoaxes**: Apps that grow very fast, especially among teens, are susceptible to human trafficking hoaxes or other negative misinformation campaigns, which can lead to rapid account deletions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>. Combating these requires relentless, multi-vector efforts (e.g., engaging journalists, school officials, police chiefs, TikTok, creating videos for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>). The key is to ensure "the K factor of the hoax" is less than that of the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>.

## Reinventing Viral Growth with Gas

After four years at Facebook, Beer launched Gas, a new version of the positive-only polling concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:16:04">[59:16:04]</a>. Despite the similar concept, it required a "zero to one development cycle" to figure out how to grow it again in a new regulatory and market climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Changes**: Changes in regulations meant apps could no longer send texts from servers, requiring users to manually send invites from their devices, which decreased invitation volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This necessitated reinventing all growth systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.
*   **Ethical Growth**: Beer emphasizes operating "by the book" and "above board" with growth systems, never using user data in unethical ways (e.g., inviting people on their behalf without explicit consent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. He believes the "internet operates on a similar paradigm" to the Gia hypothesis, where unethical practices will eventually "come back and get even" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>.
*   **Iterative Validation**: Growth involves layers of conditional statements. The process is to validate core flow, then spread within a peer group, then hopping between peer groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. Each stage needs to be executed at 100% to get clear signal, while other parts can be "half-assed" initially to avoid scope creep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.
*   **Naming and Branding**: The app's name and icon can significantly impact virality. Renaming the app from "Crush" (pink icon) to "Gas" (black icon with a flame) significantly increased the invite rate among boys, balancing the largely female user base and contributing to wider spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.

## General Strategies for Going Viral

*   **"Inverting the Time to Value"**: In 2024, attention spans are minimal. Products must demonstrate their core value, or "aha moment," within the first three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>. This requires ruthless cutting of non-essential features and extraordinary creativity in onboarding and activation flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>.
*   **iOS Contact Permissions (iOS 18)**: Upcoming changes in iOS 18 will make it much harder to find and invite friends through contact sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>. This will force founders to rethink how they enable friend finding and will likely entrench incumbents further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:37">[01:25:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:24">[01:26:24]</a>.
*   **Holistic Growth Strategy**: [[Marketplace growth strategies|Marketing]] and product growth should not be separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:16">[01:33:16]</a>. Everything from ads to in-app experience and invite flows must be aligned to maximize user acquisition and flywheel spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>.

While true long-term "durability" for consumer social apps can be akin to a Black Swan event due to randomness, rapid viral growth is a science that can be achieved with certainty if executed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>.

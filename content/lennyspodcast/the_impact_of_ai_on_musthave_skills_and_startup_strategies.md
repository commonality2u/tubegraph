The landscape of technology and business is being fundamentally reshaped by artificial intelligence, leading to a dynamic environment where the models used today are considered "the worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. This unprecedented pace of change means that every two months, computers can perform tasks previously thought impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This rapid evolution demands a completely different approach to building products and a constant re-evaluation of strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

## [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | AI's Impact on Product Development and Roles]]

Unlike traditional software development where the underlying technology is relatively fixed (e.g., databases), AI models are in a constant state of improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This means product teams cannot rely on static capabilities.

### The Evolving Technology Stack
Traditional computing relies on defined inputs leading to defined outputs, like buttons on an app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. However, large language models (LLMs) operate on "fuzzy, subtle inputs," understanding the nuances of human language, and do not necessarily produce the exact same output every time, even for the same query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. This fuzziness means that product design must adapt significantly depending on the model's accuracy, whether it's 60%, 95%, or 99.5% right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

### The Importance of Evals (Evaluations)
A critical new skill for product builders in the AI era is [[ai_in_product_management_and_implications_for_startups | writing evals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>. Evals are essentially "quizzes for a model," designed to test its proficiency in specific areas, such as creative writing, graduate-level science, or competitive coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

The importance of evals stems from several factors:
*   **Understanding Model Performance:** Knowing the model's accuracy for a given use case dictates how a product should be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Evals enable continuous learning for models. By testing a model against important use cases, product teams can gather data and fine-tune models to improve their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.
*   **Unlocking Potential:** It is argued that the full potential of AI models is "almost like capped in how amazing it can be by that how good we are at Evals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. The more precisely we can test and define what we want models to do, the better they will become.

### New Skills for Product Teams
The integration of AI will change the structure and skills required within product teams:
*   **Researcher Integration:** Product teams will increasingly include "quasi researcher machine learning engineer types" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. This is because fine-tuning models to perform better on specific use cases will become a core workflow for building most products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.
*   **Decisiveness and Ambiguity:** Product managers will need high agency, comfort with ambiguity, and the ability to lead through influence, particularly given the self-directed nature of research functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>. Decisiveness is key in an environment where answers are not always obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.
*   **Human Analogs for Design:** A counterintuitive learning is that often, one can reason about how an AI product should work, or why an AI behavior is true, by thinking about how a human would react or perform the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. This can inform UI design (e.g., how an AI indicates it's "thinking") and even how models might be structured (e.g., "brainstorming" in a group of models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

### AI in Day-to-Day Work (Vibe Coding)
Internally, AI is heavily utilized for tasks like summarizing documents, writing product specifications, and generating evals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. A notable practice is "vibe coding," where developers use AI coding assistants (like Cursor, Windsurf, or GitHub Copilot) to rapidly generate code for prototypes or proof-of-concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. This allows for quick exploration of ideas and minimizes the need for traditional design tools like Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>.

## [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | Startup Strategies and Opportunities in the AI Era]]

For startups, navigating the AI landscape requires understanding where foundational model companies like OpenAI will and will not focus.

### Focusing on the Edges of AI Capabilities
Despite the ambition of large AI companies, they acknowledge that "there are way more smart people outside your walls than there are inside your walls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. This leads to a strong focus on building robust APIs to empower external developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

Opportunities for startups include:
*   **Industry-Specific Solutions:** There are immense opportunities in "every industry and every vertical in the world to go build AI based products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. Much of the world's data and knowledge is not public (e.g., behind company walls), allowing startups to leverage specific data for tailored AI solutions where foundational models won't venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.
*   **"Model Maximalism":** A key philosophy is to "keep going" even if a product is "right on the edge of the capabilities of the models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. The rapid improvement of models means that what barely works today will "sing" in a few months, making it strategically wise to build for future model capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

### The Power of Fine-Tuning and Ensembles
Startups and companies can gain significant advantages by:
*   **Fine-tuning Models:** Instead of relying solely on general-purpose models via API, companies can fine-tune models by providing "a bunch of examples of the kinds of things you wanted to be better at" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. This teaches the model to be much better at particular tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.
*   **Using Ensembles of Models:** Complex problems can be broken down into more specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>. Different models (including fine-tuned ones) of varying sizes can be used for different latency or cost requirements, with custom prompts for each. This "ensemble" approach leverages specific models for specific purposes, much like how humans with diverse skills collaborate in a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.

### New Avenues for Creativity
AI is already transforming creative work like writing and design. The next big leap will be in "AI assisted creativity," where tools like Sora (video generation) allow individuals to explore far more ideas and achieve better final results than previously possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>. This empowers even those with limited artistic ability to bring creative thoughts to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.

### Unmet Needs: Personalized Tutoring
One of the most important potential applications of AI, surprisingly, is not yet widespread: "personalized tutoring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. Studies consistently show that combining classroom education with personalized tutoring leads to "multiple standard deviation improvements in learning speed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. With free access to capable models like ChatGPT, this remains a massive, world-changing opportunity that has yet to be fully realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.

## Overall Optimism and the Future of AI

Ultimately, the perspective on AI is largely optimistic. Technology has historically driven advancements in economics, geopolitics, quality of life, and longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>. While there may be temporary dislocations and impacts on individuals, AI models are continually getting "smarter, faster, cheaper, and safer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>. This exponential improvement, far exceeding Moore's Law, suggests a future profoundly different from today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. The most important mindset is that "the AI models that you're using today is the worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.

Eric Reese, known for creating the Lean Startup methodology, has recently been involved in discussions surrounding the [[ais_impact_on_product_development_and_skills | impact of AI]] on various sectors, including product development and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. He notes that questions of governance have become particularly acute for [[ais_impact_on_product_development_and_skills | AI companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Current Observations on AI and Product Development

Reese highlights a shift in perception regarding AI. He suggests that people are not truly afraid of AI itself, but rather of corporations deploying AI without proper alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>. He argues that AI, fundamentally, is a management technology that manages intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>.

### AI's Role in Management and Efficiency
One significant change AI introduces is its ability to manage intelligence and solve complex management problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>. AI's strength in summarization could drastically reduce the need for extensive human labor in consolidating information within large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. This means a CEO could soon have a comprehensive summary of their company's operations without relying on numerous middle managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.

However, challenges arise when dealing with AI agents, which can sometimes pass tasks to other agents indefinitely or get stuck in infinite research loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>. This mirrors common issues found in human management structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.

### Practical Applications and Future Trends
Reese gives an example of a practical [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | AI application]] in sales prospecting, where GPT-4 was used to generate personalized, creative cold emails to 10,000 Shopify store owners, resulting in successful leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>.

This rapid, high-volume experimentation, previously impossible, suggests that all communication channels will soon be saturated with [[future_of_startups_and_product_development_with_ai | AI-generated content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45">[01:28:45]</a>. This could lead to the need for AI-powered email clients to filter and summarize incoming messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>.

Looking ahead, Reese is excited about the potential for [[future_of_startups_and_product_development_with_ai | AI-powered marketplaces]] to foster more fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. AI could allow all vendors to submit comprehensive proposals, with AI agents on the receiving end filtering based on explicit procurement policies, thus leveling the playing field and potentially making advertising less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations and Governance
Reese stresses that [[impact_of_ai_on_product_teams | AI forces]] companies to take issues of governance and alignment seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>. He suggests that if companies want to build trust, they must embed their values into the organization's structure, ensuring promises are kept even if original founders are no longer present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:13">[01:35:13]</a>.

He highlights the potential for AI to bring about significant advancements, such as one-hour travel from San Francisco to Tokyo, weather control to solve famine and drought, and biological AI capable of synthesizing molecules based on natural language descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a>. However, these advancements come with obvious risks and downsides that demand serious consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>.

The core question, according to Reese, is how to take ethical action in the face of high uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>. His framework suggests choosing actions today that make ethical sense across a wide range of possible future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>. This includes advocating for more transparency, increased capacity, and competent leaders committed to certain values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>.

Reese advocates for building companies where human flourishing is at the core, not just for ethical reasons, but also as a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:38">[01:37:38]</a>. He argues that companies focused on creating net new value and prioritizing stakeholders tend to outperform their competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:06">[01:38:06]</a>. This approach is exemplified by companies that value long-term thinking and customer centricity, such as Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:05">[01:53:05]</a>. He challenges the shareholder primacy theory, suggesting it can lead to short-sighted decisions that ultimately destroy value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>.

## Advice for Founders
For founders facing uncertainty or considering a pivot, Reese offers several pieces of advice:
*   **Admit the truth**: If you're questioning whether you have product-market fit or if your current strategy is working, you likely already know the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
*   **Fixed timeframe for action**: Give yourself a fixed period to take decisive action, whether it's trying to make the current thing work by focusing 100% on one critical task, or exploring a new idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>.
*   **Embrace learning from failure**: The essence of MVP is to find out as soon as possible what catastrophic thing might destroy your company, allowing time to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>.
*   **Prioritize well-being**: Having a startup fail is not the worst thing; far worse is being stuck in a "zombie" company that won't die, which contributes to a [[mental_health_impact_on_startup_founders | mental health crisis among Founders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. He advises founders to ask themselves if they would start the same company again if they had a magic wand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>.
*   **Protect your mission**: Founders should consult with their lawyers to ensure their company's legal structure protects its mission and values, even against external pressures like acquisitions that go against their principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>. This often involves establishing things like public benefit corporation status or mission pledges early on, as it becomes increasingly difficult to implement later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace continuous alignment**: Building a company where every decision promotes human flourishing is a relentless and constant process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:10">[01:49:10]</a>. This holistic approach, integrating governance, management, and [[understanding_company_cultures_impact_on_product_development | company culture]], creates a cohesive and resilient organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:16">[01:49:16]</a>.

Reese emphasizes that new companies are incredibly valuable, and founders, as the "manufacturers" of these essential entities, have the collective power to set the terms for their creation and existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:57">[02:12:57]</a>.

Ros Herberg, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) and VP of Product Strategy at Wiz, exemplifies a non-traditional career trajectory, having transitioned from an engineering background, through product management, and into a leadership role in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>. Her journey offers valuable [[navigating_career_transitions_and_promotions | insights into navigating career transitions and promotions]] and [[career_advancement_strategies | career advancement strategies]] in a fast-paced tech environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

## Early Career and the Path to Product

Ros began her career as an engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. She then moved into product management, a role she held for most of her career before joining Wiz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Prior to Wiz, Ros led security products at Microsoft, including Azure Sentinel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This deep technical background and experience in [[career_growth_framework_for_Product_Managers | product management]] would later prove invaluable in her marketing role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

## The Unexpected Shift to Marketing at Wiz

Wiz, founded in March 2020, experienced unprecedented growth, hitting $100 million ARR just 18 months after its founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39">[01:39]</a>. Despite this success and clear product-market fit, a challenge emerged around awareness and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29">[02:29]</a>. Customers were discovering Wiz only after having signed with competitors, indicating a gap in outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50">[02:50]</a>.

Around two and a half years into Wiz, CEO Assaf Rappaport asked Ros to take on the marketing leadership role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44">[02:44]</a>. Ros initially found the request bizarre, as she had never worked in marketing or the go-to-market side, and was unfamiliar with basic marketing concepts like "leads" or "pipeline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02">[02:02]</a>. However, driven by a philosophy of following good people and a belief that marketing was crucial for scaling the company, she decided to "give it a try" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40">[02:40]</a>.

### Following the "Heat" in the Organization

Ros describes her career moves, including the shift to marketing, as following "where the heat is within your organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28">[02:28]</a>. As a company grows, the critical areas of focus shift:
*   **Early Days**: The "heat" is in product, as everyone is waiting for something to be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26">[02:26]</a>.
*   **Next Phase**: It moves to engineering to build the product that customers want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38">[02:38]</a>.
*   **Scaling Sales**: The "heat" shifts to sales once the product is ready to be sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48">[02:48]</a>.
*   **Marketing for Scale**: Finally, it moves to marketing when the sales team needs more pipeline and brand awareness to grow further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">[02:57]</a>.

This perspective highlights a key aspect of [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | career growth and strategic positioning]] within a scaling company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14">[02:14]</a>.

## Ros's Marketing Philosophy: Making Noise and Embracing Risk

As a non-traditional marketer, Ros's approach was shaped by her product background and deep understanding of the customer and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19">[03:19]</a>. She focused on making "a lot of noise" to address the core problem of low brand awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a>.

Her philosophy contrasts product development, where "less is more" and mistakes have a high cost due to engineering time and product complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56">[03:56]</a>. In marketing, she realized, "there's no cost to anything, no maintenance to anything, no technical debt, no anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42">[03:42]</a>. This means if a marketing effort fails, it can be quickly abandoned without lasting consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54">[03:54]</a>. This insight led her to "try everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a>.

### The "Wiz of Oz" Booth

A notable example of her "make noise" approach was the Wiz booth at RSA, a major security conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12">[03:12]</a>. Instead of a typical "red and black, people with hoodies" cyber booth, Ros opted for a "Wiz of Oz" theme, complete with actors dressed as Dorothy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55">[03:55]</a>. This unusual and optimistic approach, which she admits was "scary" and a potential "failure or a hit," resulted in five times more visitors than the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42">[04:42]</a>. Other cyber companies have since started adopting similar themed booths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22">[04:22]</a>. This demonstrates effective [[strategies_for_effective_marketing_in_a_tech_startup | marketing in a tech startup]] by focusing on differentiation and memorability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22">[04:22]</a>.

### Why CMOS Often Fail

Ros believes the CMO role is "very very hard" and often fails due to a lack of deep trust with the founding team and insufficient connection to the product and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16">[03:16]</a>. Marketing is highly visible, and misrepresenting the company's brand can easily break trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30">[03:30]</a>. Her background in security and product gave her this crucial understanding, which outsiders might struggle to gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52">[03:52]</a>.

## Lessons for Product Leaders from a Marketing Lens

Having moved from product to marketing, Ros gained significant insights for product leaders:
*   **Criticality of Marketing**: Product leaders often underestimate the importance of marketing and product marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>.
*   **Bridging the Gap**: Marketing bridges the gap between the technical product team and the wider market (customers, sales, general audience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25">[04:25]</a>.
*   **Clarity is Key**: Messages that seem acceptable or "fluffy" within product development become "lost in translation" when scaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51">[04:51]</a>. Product teams must deliver "crystal clear, black and white" messages about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>. This involves understanding how to effectively communicate product value to a broader audience, which is a key aspect of [[challenges_and_strategies_in_integrating_sales_and_marketing | integrating sales and marketing]] efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>.

### The "Dummy Explanation"

Ros champions the concept of the "dummy explanation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33">[04:33]</a>. This means ensuring that everything written or produced by the marketing team is understandable by anyone, regardless of their prior knowledge of Wiz or the deep technical market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>. This constant self-reminder helps avoid assuming knowledge and using complex terminology that can alienate potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56">[04:56]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Resilience

Ros's [[navigating_career_transitions_and_promotions | navigating career transitions and promotions]] are underpinned by a core personal quality: being "okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail at something and still attempting it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19">[04:19]</a>. This attitude, she says, comes from her upbringing, where her mother encouraged her to push beyond her comfort zone and embrace "friction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39">[04:39]</a>.

She also has a contrarian view on imposter syndrome:
> "I won't be able to build that confidence. I do feel like an imposter and I know there's always like those statistics about many people feeling that way so I think like maybe just like let's embrace it. I feel like an imposter, you feel like an imposter, everybody feels like an imposter. It's like kind of maybe embrace it but don't let that stop you from making a decision. Like maybe they will find out you're an imposter, maybe let them find out, like it's fine." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24">[04:24]</a>

This perspective allows her to take on new challenges and enables rapid [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | career growth and strategic positioning]] by accepting vulnerability and continuously trying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24">[04:24]</a>. Ros also advises that if something feels "too complex" – whether it's a product feature or a life problem – it's likely not the right solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54">[01:54]</a>. Taking a step back to find a simpler path is often the key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54">[01:54]</a>.

Shas Doshi shares three questions, plus a bonus, he wished he had asked himself earlier in his product management career, reflecting on years of "suffering" in the role with "zero complaints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Among these, he explores why product leaders are perpetually busy and why the job can be so frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Why Product Leaders Are So Busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>

Shas Doshi spent most of his 20-year career in product feeling "completely stressed out" and perpetually busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This constant busyness left him dissatisfied at the end of the day, even after working hard, and manifested in health issues like pains and aches caused by stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. He notes that this is a common experience among senior product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

He highlights that traditional productivity tips, such as maintaining a to-do list, using frameworks like LNO, or managing a calendar, eventually hit an "immovable force" in a product career: scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. As product leaders grow, their scope expands to a point where no amount of efficiency, prioritization, or tools can overcome the sheer volume of work, leading to constant busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### Annual Planning as a Source of Busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
Annual planning is a prime example of this overwhelming scope. Product leaders often spend 4-6 weeks filling out spreadsheets, attending meetings, managing dependencies, and meeting with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This process can make leaders feel guilty because it takes time away from supporting their teams and making product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Doshi observed that these elaborate plans often become irrelevant by late February due to customer escalations for un-planned features, leading to constant revisions and reliance on unofficial lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The common adage, "Plans are useless, but planning is everything," is often cited but poorly understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

At Stripe, Doshi realized that a strong, aligned product strategy could drastically reduce planning time. By having a "real product strategy" that everyone understood and pre-aligned on, his planning for a major product took only three days, compared to the 4-6 weeks his peers spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This approach eliminates the need for "false precision" in resource allocation, such as debating whether a team needs eight or nine engineers for the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

The tactical tip to combat busyness in planning is to prioritize a clear, aligned product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. This strategy simplifies prioritization, minimizes planning problems, and provides a framework for handling sales or support escalations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

### Poor Product Decisions Lead to More Work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>
Another key realization Doshi had about busyness was that it stemmed from not making good product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Product teams often make quick decisions on features without thoroughly considering customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Decisions are sometimes made based on engineer availability rather than strategic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

This leads to building features that are not truly impactful. When these features are presented at QBRs and show low adoption, leaders resort to "favorable anecdotes" instead of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. Sales teams might then highlight that the feature isn't winning deals, prompting demands for additional "bells and whistles" to meet "table stakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. This results in signing up for even more work on a feature that should not have been built in the first place, accumulating "feature debt" and leading to persistent busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

Doshi advises that most decisions that appear to be "two-way doors" (easily reversible) are often "one-way doors" for product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. He suggests that it is valuable to pause for "2 minutes, or two days, or two weeks" before making a decision, as "thinking is cheap" and leads to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

## Why the Job Feels So Frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>

Despite loving his PM leadership role, Doshi experienced daily frustrations due to the inherent loneliness of the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. He discovered that frustration arises when product leaders operate mostly "in misalignment with our superpowers and who we truly are at our core" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

He outlines three levels at which product work happens:
*   **Impact level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>
*   **Execution level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>
*   **Optics level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>

Doshi's "happy place" was the impact level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. However, as product leaders advance in their careers, they are increasingly required to spend time at the "Optics level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. While they might possess the skills and willpower for this, willpower is finite, and prolonged work outside of one's preferred operating level leads to frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

His solution was to abandon the traditional career path dictated by external expectations (e.g., societal norms, LinkedIn profiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. At Stripe, upon realizing that managing a team of around 50 people meant spending too much time on optics, he opted to return to working on earlier-stage products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

His advice is to identify your "superpowers" and align your career decisions with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. By being true to oneself and operating in alignment with natural strengths, product leaders can achieve their best work, love their jobs, excel, and avoid frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.

### The Challenge of "Good Taste" in Beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>
Doshi also questions whether he truly possessed "good taste" in his beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. Early in his career at Google, he adopted the prevailing belief that "we don't do strategy here; strategy is for MBAs," and that "execution is everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This belief persisted despite a wise peer nudging him to consider strategy for his product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

It wasn't until his time at Twitter (circa 2014, post-IPO), where he observed a company with incredible assets struggling to meet its potential, that he realized Twitter's biggest problem was a lack of a "real product strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. This solidified at Stripe, where he saw the greater value of clear strategy for early-stage products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

Taste, beyond just beautiful pixels or product design, is about identifying what is truly good without needing to see its results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. For example, it requires "zero taste" to recognize Nvidia's CEO as a genius in 2024, but it would have required taste to do so in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. He cautions against becoming "stuff graders" who criticize everything, as this also requires "zero taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.

Doshi notes how product leaders are often swayed by:
*   **Cool metaphors:** Like "two-way doors" (versus "reversible and irreversible decisions") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **Authority bias:** Adopting ideas because someone famous like Jeff Bezos said them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   **Alliterations:** Preferring "fail fast" over "fail quickly," even though they mean the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **Complicated charts and math:** Being impressed by complexity they don't fully understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

To develop better taste, Doshi realized he needed to shed these ingrained patterns and evaluate ideas independently of their "social proof and Authority proof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. This shift made him a more critical thinker and was a meaningful change in his growth as a product leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.

### Are You Really Listening? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>
The final, and perhaps hardest, question Doshi asks is "Am I really listening?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a> He initially believed he was a good listener because he would recap, make eye contact, and confirm understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. However, he realized there is an "entirely other level to listening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. Understanding this deeper level of listening is what enables world-class leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. He suggests exploring the insights of Rick Rubin, Dee Hock, and Peter Drucker on listening for further resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

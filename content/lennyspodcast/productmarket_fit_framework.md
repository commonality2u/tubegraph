From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Finding [[product_market_fit | Product Market Fit]] (PMF) is considered the single most important task for a startup in its first three years, yet it is often underexplored and underexplained as a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This framework, developed by Todd Jackson and the First Round Capital team after analyzing data from hundreds of startups, aims to provide a practical and actionable guide for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

The framework is primarily for early B2B founders, especially those focused on sales-led rather than bottom-up approaches, typically in the first six to nine months of their company's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Its goal is to increase the odds of finding PMF, reduce the role of luck, and provide a clear path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## Defining [[product_market_fit | Product Market Fit]]

The ultimate goal of the framework is to achieve [[product_market_fit | extreme product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

> "[[product_market_fit | Extreme product market fit]] is a state of widespread demand for a product that satisfies a critical need and crucially can be delivered repeatably and efficiently to each customer." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>

This definition highlights three key ideas:
*   **Demand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>
*   **Satisfaction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>
*   **Efficiency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>

Efficiency is often overlooked, but it's crucial for long-term viability, preventing situations where a product generates demand and satisfaction but is unsustainable (e.g., the "$100 vending machine" example where a dollar input yields a hundred dollars output) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. As a company progresses, the "marginal customer" should become easier and easier to acquire and serve, indicating increasing efficiency and strengthening [[product_market_fit | PMF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Four Levels of [[stages_of_productmarket_fit | Product Market Fit]]

[[product_market_fit | Product Market Fit]] is not binary; it happens in a sequence of levels over multiple years. For the best Enterprise companies, achieving [[product_market_fit | extreme product market fit]] typically takes roughly four to six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Founders often make tradeoffs between satisfaction, demand, and efficiency at each level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

The four levels are:
1.  Nascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>
2.  Developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>
3.  Strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>
4.  Extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>

### Level 1: Nascent [[product_market_fit | Product Market Fit]]
At this stage, your startup is likely pre-seed or seed stage with fewer than 10 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Find three to five customers with an important and urgent problem, and deliver a deeply satisfying solution that fulfills a key promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Prioritize satisfaction first. It's acceptable to be inefficient if it helps uncover an intensely satisfying customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $0 to $500k <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
    *   Demand Source: Mostly from personal network (friends, family, VCs). Expect to make ~20 warm introductions for one sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
    *   Efficiency Metrics: Not applicable/too early to track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Example (Vanta)**: Vanta initially didn't have a product for SOC 2 compliance. Founder Christina Copo manually filled out spreadsheets and posed as AI to help early design partners (like Segment, Front, Figma) get their SOC 2 certification, unlocking revenue for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This showcased extreme satisfaction despite being highly inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Signs of being stuck (common at this level)**:
    *   Customers wouldn't be disappointed if your product disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
    *   Handful of happy customers, but their most important features differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
    *   Difficulty finding the next new customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
    *   Low product usage or slow growth after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
    *   Being "friendzoned" by customers (they like you but don't *need* you). Rick Song of Persona asked customers direct questions to avoid this, such as: "Is Persona a necessity? If we went away, how painful would that be? If a competitor charged half as much, would you switch?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **Timeframe**: Ideally 12-18 months, as choosing the right persona and problem is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

### Level 2: Developing [[product_market_fit | Product Market Fit]]
At this stage, you are typically a seed or Series A company with up to 20 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Scale from 5 to 25 satisfied customers by focusing on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. The product needs to do much of the heavy lifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Start thinking about demand in addition to satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. You're looking for early signs of a scalable channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $500k to $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
    *   Sales Conversion: ~10% for first call to close (without a warm intro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
    *   Magic Number (New ARR / CAC): ~0.5 to 0.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
    *   Regretted Churn: Up to 10-20% (regretted churn is okay) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
    *   Net Revenue Retention (NRR): At least 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
    *   Gross Margin: Not worse than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
    *   Burn Multiple: Not worse than 5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   **Looker**: Spent a long time at Level 1, with the founder doing intensive consulting for early customers. Once they had a repeatable "forward deploy" process, they rapidly moved from 5 to 25 customers with a ~75% close rate and zero churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. They then focused on demand channels like SDRs and partner marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Ironclad**: Initially struggled to sell as an "AI Legal Assistant." A customer inquiry about "CLM" (Contract Lifecycle Management) revealed an existing category with budget. Ironclad pivoted its positioning to be an "AI-powered contract management software," playing in an existing market but with a superior product, which allowed them to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   **Signs of being stuck**:
    *   Difficulty opening the "demand floodgates" despite happy existing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
    *   Regretted churn > 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
    *   Slow sales cycles, losing late-stage deals, or struggling to hit desired price points (customers saying "no budget" or "not the right time" means no) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Timeframe**: Ideally around one year to move from 5 to 25 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. If stuck for 12-18 months, a pivot should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### Level 3: Strong [[product_market_fit | Product Market Fit]]
This is where [[product_market_fit | PMF]] "starts to get fun," with demand picking up significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Achieve repeatability, where the marginal customer becomes much easier to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Grow from 25 to 100+ customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Maintain satisfaction and demand while bringing efficiency into focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   Team Size: 30-100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
    *   Funding Stage: Series B or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
    *   Demand Channels: Cracked at least one scalable marketing and sales channel. >10% of inbound from referrals and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
    *   Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $5 million to $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
    *   Average Contract Value (ACV): Can vary, but e.g., ~ $75k with strong repeatability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
    *   Gross Margin: >60% (ideally >70%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
    *   Burn Multiple: <3 (ideally 1-3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
    *   Regretted Churn: <10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
    *   Net Revenue Retention (NRR): >110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Signs of being stuck**:
    *   Leaky bucket (NRR <90%, regretted churn >10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
    *   Growth slowing down (e.g., struggling to do 2x after 3x prior) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
    *   Existing scalable channel getting saturated, requiring new channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
    *   Growing but spending too much money to do so (burn multiple worsens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
*   **Timeframe**: This can be a long stage, possibly two years, as you scale revenue significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

### Level 4: Extreme [[product_market_fit | Product Market Fit]]
Achieving this level means you have built a highly valuable company, often a unicorn, with aspirations to become a decacorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Sustain growth by expanding Total Addressable Market (TAM), either by entering new markets or launching multiple products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. This requires finding [[product_market_fit | PMF]] again and again for new offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Maintain high levels of satisfaction, demand, and efficiency simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   Team Size: >100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
    *   Funding Stage: Series C, Series D, or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
    *   Customers: >100 customers, aiming for hundreds or thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
    *   Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): >$25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
    *   Sales Conversion: >15% first call to close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
    *   Magic Number: >1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
    *   CAC Payback: <12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
    *   Gross Margin: >80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
    *   Burn Multiple: <1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.
    *   Regretted Churn: <10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
    *   Net Revenue Retention (NRR): >120% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Vanta expanding into platform and other security products; Verkada adding alarms, smoke detectors, and badge readers to its cloud security cameras; Stripe with Radar and Atlas; Square with Cash App and Square Loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   **Timeframe**: Typically takes a couple of years to scale from $25 million ARR to $100 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## The Four Ps for Unsticking [[product_market_fit | PMF]]

When a company gets stuck at any level of [[product_market_fit | PMF]], founders need to consider pivoting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. The framework suggests focusing on four key elements, or "Ps," to evaluate and adjust:
1.  **Persona**: Who are you targeting? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>
2.  **Problem**: What problem are you solving for them? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>
3.  **Promise**: How are you pitching or describing the solution (positioning)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>
4.  **Product**: What is the actual solution you are building? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>

All four elements must align: your product must deliver a promise that solves the problem of your persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Pivots can involve changing one or more of these elements:
*   **Lattis**: Kept the **Persona** (Heads of HR) but changed the **Problem** (from OKR management to performance management) and the **Promise** (modern, employee-friendly solution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Plaid**: Kept the core **Product** (connecting to bank accounts) but completely changed the **Persona** (from consumers with budgeting issues to fintech developers) and the **Problem** and **Promise** (offering an API for bank account connectivity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Vanta**: Changed all four, initially pursuing a B2B Alexa idea before landing on compliance automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

Founders often struggle with making sufficient changes. Jack Altman of Lattis noted that "most founders do like a 10% pivot and what they need to be doing is a 200% pivot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. It's psychologically challenging to abandon existing work, but a willingness to let go is often required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

### Dollar-Driven Customer Discovery
This approach helps test the "dollar potential" of a hypothesis, rather than just passively listening to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The goal is to identify extreme value, confirm ability to pay, and gauge willingness to pay.

**1. Identify Extreme Value:**
*   Ask about top goals and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   Avoid "happy ears" (only hearing what supports your idea) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   Look for "wow" statements or demonstrated interest (e.g., asking for another meeting, wanting to show it to colleagues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   Ask what stands out as valuable and listen for quick, specific answers about impact (e.g., makes product better, drives business success, saves money/risk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

**2. Confirm Ability to Pay:**
*   Ask: "Are you currently looking for a product like this, or are you building something internally?" (Customers looking for solutions or having failed at building their own are ideal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   Ask: "Where would a budget for this come from?" (Look for existing budgets or displaced costs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   Ask: "How does your team make decisions on third-party tools?" (Seek a known process, not ambiguity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

**3. Gauge Willingness to Pay:**
*   Ask: "What's your budget for solving this? What are you paying for this other tool?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   Ask the "Simon-Kucher questions": "What is a fair price for this? What would be an expensive price? What would be a prohibitively expensive price?" The "expensive" price is often what a truly satisfied customer would actually pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

This process involves showing the right fidelity of product or demo based on what's needed to secure a sale (e.g., Figma mockups vs. actual data demos vs. manual service delivery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. You've talked to enough people when you can predict 70-80% of what the next person will say, having clearly heard the patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The journey to [[product_market_fit | extreme product market fit]] is challenging and rarely linear. Approximately 60-70% of companies never get past Level 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. This framework, particularly the emphasis on the Four Ps and diligent customer discovery, aims to increase the odds for B2B founders, helping them navigate the complexities and build truly valuable companies.

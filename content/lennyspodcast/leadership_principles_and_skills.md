## The Magic Loop for Career Growth

The "Magic Loop" is a five-step process designed to help individuals grow their career, even with a difficult manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. It's a powerful tool because it is in an individual's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> and forms a partnership with leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Steps of the Magic Loop
1.  **Do your current job well**: Ensure you are performing at a solid level. Your manager shouldn't wish you were different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. A good job is defined by your manager's perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
2.  **Ask your boss how you can help**: Very few people ask their manager what they can do to help them, which sets you apart and builds a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This shows you are part of their organization to make them successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
3.  **Do whatever they ask**: Follow through on their requests, even if it's not your preferred type of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
4.  **Propose mutually beneficial work**: After helping out, approach your manager and ask if there's a way you can help them that also helps you reach your personal career goals, such as changing roles, getting a raise, or learning a new skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Managers help those who help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. It is crucial to know your goal for this step to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This step also implicitly helps identify gaps keeping you from the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. It's important to share your goal with your manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.
5.  **Repeat**: Continuously engage in this loop to build trust and a strong relationship with your manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

The "Magic Loop" is effective because managers are rarely offered help and often feel overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. It leverages the "you help me, I'll help you" aspect of human nature, forming a partnership rather than an adversarial relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This process can be initiated by managers as well, by asking about employee goals and offering partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

Testimonials show that individuals applying the Magic Loop have received significant raises, promotions, and transitioned into new roles and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This applies from early career to executive levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. At higher levels, it evolves into anticipating needs and proactively acting, keeping leadership informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

### Advancing from Senior Manager to Executive
Breaking through the senior manager level (e.g., L7, M1, M2) is challenging due to limited director positions and rapid company growth no longer being the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. Promotions at this level require both qualifications and the existence of a suitable role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

The key to advancing is changing behavior:
*   **Shift from functional strength to influence and coordination**: Senior managers succeed by being strong in their function and getting things done, but directors and VPs must focus on influencing others and delegating details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. "What got you here won't get you there" is a relevant concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   **Practice next-level skills**: Start taking on strategic projects and demonstrate inventiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. This includes "doing the job before you have the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.
*   **Become the chosen person**: In competitive environments, aim to be the standout candidate when opportunities arise, such as when peers are let go or promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

Managers actively seek to promote capable individuals because stronger direct reports enable them to do less of their own job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

## Inventiveness and Innovation

Jeff Bezos views himself primarily as an inventor, aiming to create an "invention machine" at Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Systematic inventiveness isn't magic; it can be learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

Key aspects of inventiveness:
*   **Expertise**: Possess sufficient knowledge in the area you wish to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Dedicated thinking time**: Allocate focused time, away from distractions, to concentrate on problems and how existing knowledge can be combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.
*   **Combination of existing ideas**: True invention often comes from combining two existing concepts rather than creating something entirely new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>, e.g., drone delivery and an aircraft carrier leading to a drone-carrying truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **Optimization**: A significant part of innovation is the ongoing optimization of an initial idea, making it cheaper, better, and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. Amazon Prime, for example, started with fast shipping and evolved to include numerous other services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

## Lessons from Failure and Crisis Management

A significant failure on a public launch for Jeff Bezos offered several critical lessons:
*   **Own the problem**: Immediately admit fault and take ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.
*   **Proactive communication**: Provide frequent, proactive updates to regain trust and prevent micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. By providing hourly updates, trust can be rebuilt incrementally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
*   **Seek assistance**: Accept help from other teams or leaders, even if it highlights design flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.
*   **Face the challenge directly**: Meeting angry superiors in person is harder but can lead to forgiveness and rebuilding relationships, as face-to-face confrontation encourages more human interaction than emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>.
*   **Work hard and fast to recover**: When a mistake occurs, it's crucial to pull out all stops to fix the problem, even if it means working long hours or during weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
*   **Persevere through shame**: Many might quit after a public failure, but overcoming shame and continuing to demonstrate competence can lead to recovery and advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. Even when faced with the possibility of termination, a "bullheadedness" to move forward is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>.
*   **Adjust behavior**: Learn from the mistake and adapt future approaches, such as valuing reliability over speed at scale or "fearing the New York Times headline" to prevent major public outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.
*   **Support your team**: Recognize and address the impact of a failure on team members, especially junior ones, who might feel undue responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>. [[importance_of_trust_and_vulnerability_in_leadership | The importance of trust and vulnerability in leadership]] means being there for your team, even when they make mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.

## Amazon's Leadership Principles

Amazon operates by 14 core leadership principles, one of which was influenced by Ethan Evans:
*   **Ownership**: Ethan proposed the seven words "an owner never says that's not my job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This principle emphasizes that leaders are owners, thinking long-term and acting on behalf of the entire company, not just their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. This remains one of the most impactful things he has written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.
*   **Bias for Action**: This principle highlights that "speed matters in business" and many decisions are reversible, so it's important to move quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Leaders are Right a Lot / Learn and Be Curious**: This principle evolved to emphasize that leaders "actively work to disconfirm their beliefs" and seek diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:55">[01:07:55]</a>. This promotes continuous learning and avoids making decisions based on narrow viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. This aligns with [[authenticity_and_curiosity_in_leadership | Authenticity and Curiosity in Leadership]].

## Interviewing and Standing Out

When interviewing, candidates should focus on:
*   **Appearance and Enthusiasm**: These are primary factors. Show up interested and enthusiastic about the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. People prefer to work with those who want to work with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
*   **Impact, not just tasks**: Talk about *why* your work mattered and the impact you had on past employers, rather than just what you did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. Leaders hire to solve problems, not just to get work done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.
*   **Full presence in virtual interviews**: Avoid taking calls from a car or with the camera off. Maintain eye contact and use body language to project enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. Being fully engaged and energetic is a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

A preferred interview question for leaders is: "Tell me about a time where you needed to disagree with your management, where you needed to stand up or fight for a position against higher leadership or people in power." This assesses a candidate's backbone and ability to challenge constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

## Contrarian Views on Management and Work

*   **Return to Office (RTO)**: Many leaders favor a full-time return to the office, but Ethan Evans is contrarian on this point due to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>. Offices have been around for centuries, with limited room for improvement, whereas remote work is relatively new, offering vast untapped potential for innovation and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. This relates to [[evolving_team_structures_and_management_skills | evolving team structures and management skills]].
*   **Doing business on a handshake**: There's a tendency for the world to be overly contract-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. While occasionally one might be let down, trusting people's word and commitments on faith, rather than suspicion, leads to a lower overall cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>. This aligns with [[importance_of_trust_and_vulnerability_in_leadership | the importance of trust and vulnerability in leadership]].

## Recommended Books on Leadership and Decision Making

*   **"Decisive" by Chip and Dan Heath**: Focuses on the science of making better decisions, applicable to both professional and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>.
*   **"Leadership and Self-Deception" by The Arbinger Institute**: Explores how individuals often cause their own interpersonal problems by self-deception and how to take responsibility for one's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>.
*   **"The Almanac of Naval Ravikant"**: Boils down how to be successful by leveraging one's unique strengths and loving what you do, rather than copying others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

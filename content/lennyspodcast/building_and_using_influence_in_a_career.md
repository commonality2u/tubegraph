Growing one's power and influence in a career leads to numerous positive outcomes, including [[navigating_career_transitions_and_promotions | promotions]], increased happiness, and reduced stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This concept isn't about personality, but rather about mastering specific skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, teaches these principles in his popular MBA course "The Paths to Power" and his book, "The Seven Rules of Power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The skills of political skill and influence are associated with higher salaries, [[navigating_career_transitions_and_promotions | promotions]], and job satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. These skills are particularly crucial for individuals from underrepresented backgrounds who may face disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## The Seven Rules of Power

Jeffrey Pfeffer outlines seven core rules for [[building a longterm career strategy | building a long-term career strategy]] and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>:
1.  **Get Out of Your Own Way** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>
2.  **Break The Rules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>
3.  **Appear Powerful** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>
4.  **Build a Powerful Brand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>
5.  **Network Relentlessly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>
6.  **Use Your Power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>
7.  **Success Excuses Almost Everything** (or that once you've acquired power, what you did to get there will be forgiven or forgotten) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>

### 1. Get Out of Your Own Way

A significant barrier to acquiring power is personal discomfort or negative perceptions of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. If power is seen as "dirty" or "evil," individuals will be less likely to pursue actions that lead to [[career advancement strategies | career advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. Overcoming [[importance_of_feedback_and_selfawareness_in_career_growth | imposter syndrome]] is also crucial; believe you deserve your position and avoid self-deprecating language or preemptory apologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. Prioritize competence and respect over being liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

> "If you want to be liked, get a dog." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>

### 2. Break The Rules

Breaking conventional rules helps you stand out and become memorable, which is essential for visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. Rules are often created by those already in power, and disrupting them can lead to greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. For example, a successful venture capitalist, Jason Calacanis, consistently defies industry norms by making many small bets and running a lean operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

Another rule to break is the aversion to asking for help. People often overestimate the effort required to get assistance. Asking for help can make others feel good and is a direct path to getting what you need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.

### 3. Appear Powerful

How you present yourself significantly impacts how others perceive your power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. Research suggests that people respond mostly to how others look, then how they sound, and least to the content of what they say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>.

Key elements of appearing powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>:
*   **Body Language**: Open posture, more gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.
*   **Voice**: Louder voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>.
*   **Eye Contact**: Maintain eye contact, avoid reading from notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>.
*   **Brevity**: Keep communication brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.
*   **Confidence**: Avoid apologizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
*   **Presence**: Command the room, and strategically consider how you dress and show up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.
*   **Physical Interaction**: Gentle touching (e.g., arm or shoulder) and shaking hands can convey power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

These are skills that can be learned and mastered through practice and coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>.

### 4. Create a Powerful Brand

To advance in your career, people need to know who you are and recognize your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. [[Building a powerful brand]] involves differentiating yourself and creating value. Examples include:
*   Starting a podcast or writing to establish expertise and visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
*   Signing up partnerships to demonstrate initiative and value to a company, as Tristan Walker did for Foursquare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   Actively seeking opportunities to be seen and known, especially in competitive fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   Framing self-promotion as amplifying team impact or scaling yourself by sharing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

Visibility without substance is useless, but substance without visibility remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

### 5. Network Relentlessly

Networking, despite often feeling "dirty" or "cringey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>, is crucial for gaining knowledge and influence. The first principle of networking is generosity â€“ focusing on how you can be helpful to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

Key networking strategies:
*   **Be a Broker**: Connect people with ideas, money, or resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>. This makes you central and valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.
*   **Pursue Weak Ties**: Your close connections often share the same information and contacts. Weak ties (people less connected to your immediate circle) offer non-redundant information and introduce you to new people and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. Studies show that the best jobs often come from referrals through weak ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.
*   **Proactive Engagement**: Make a list of key people you want to meet, then strategically figure out how to connect with them (e.g., through mutual introductions, offering valuable articles, or holding dinners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.

Omid Kordestani, Google's 11th employee, achieved immense success by relentlessly networking within and outside his company, making himself known to senior leaders and gaining insights into the emerging internet industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

### 6. Use Your Power

When given a position of power, it's essential to mobilize resources and make things happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. The more you achieve, the more resources, [[navigating_career_transitions and promotions | promotions]], and opportunities you will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>. Successfully demonstrating your power creates a self-perpetuating cycle of growth; people are attracted to power and will follow your lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.

### 7. Success Excuses Almost Everything

This rule acknowledges a pragmatic reality: once power is acquired, the methods used to gain it are often overlooked or forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. People tend to gravitate towards money, power, and success, often excusing flaws or past transgressions to be associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. This demonstrates that life is not homeostatic; success often begets more success, regardless of the path taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.

## Overcoming the Knowing-Doing Gap

Many people understand these principles but fail to implement them. This is the "knowing-doing gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. To bridge this gap, practice and coaching are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>.

Pfeffer's class includes "doing power" assignments, where students must apply the principles in real-life scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Goal Setting**: Defining what success looks like and setting a [[building strategy skills and effective goal setting | development plan]] based on power attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.
*   **Creating Resources**: Identifying and creating new resources that provide leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.
*   **Practice**: Recording and getting [[importance_of_feedback and selfawareness in career growth | feedback]] on presentations or interactions to master powerful appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.
*   **Personal Brand Statement**: Articulating how one wants to be known and seeking feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.

The key is to push beyond your comfort zone incrementally, akin to the [[magic_loop_concept_for_career_growth | 15% rule]] where you try something a little bit beyond what you're comfortable with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.

## The Price of Power

While power brings benefits, it also comes with significant downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>:
*   **Loss of Autonomy**: Powerful individuals often have heavily scheduled lives with little personal control over their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
*   **Increased Scrutiny and No Privacy**: Every aspect of one's life is subject to public dissection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>.
*   **Trust Dilemma**: It becomes difficult to discern if people associate with you because of who you are or the position you hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.
*   **Impact on Family**: The demands of power can lead to stress, divorce, and other negative consequences for family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

Building and using influence is a fundamental aspect of [[career advancement strategies | career advancement]] and effectiveness. These skills are learnable, but require consistent practice and a willingness to step outside one's comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. Seeking [[importance_of_feedback and selfawareness in career growth | coaching]] or creating a personal board of directors can provide the necessary guidance and accountability to master these vital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12">[01:18:12]</a>. Ultimately, power is a tool; its impact depends on the intentions of those who wield it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

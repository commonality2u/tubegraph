Claire V., a long-time Chief Product Officer and two-time founder, engineer, designer, and marketer, shares her insights and experiences regarding the role of women in the technology industry, particularly at executive levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. Despite her significant success, she emphasizes that navigating the tech landscape as a woman remains challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

## Current State and Challenges

Claire highlights the statistical disparities in the tech industry:
*   Only approximately 13% of founders in the last year were women, a declining trend year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   Female-led founded teams received only about 2% of venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
*   Women hold 30% of senior leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.
*   Women comprise 30% of software engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>.

She clarifies that her experience is not about impostor syndrome, given her proven track record as a founder, successful exit, and CPO across large teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. Instead, it's about the inherent difficulty and difference in navigating the industry as a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

### Personal Anecdotes

Claire recalls fighting for her all-girls school to offer computer science at the same level as the all-boys school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. She also encountered inappropriate comments, such as VCs advising her "don't get pregnant" during her early career in startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

Even at her current executive level, such incidents continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. A consistent experience for her is being asked if she's "technical" enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. This question is particularly perplexing given her background as a technical co-founder who wrote code for 12 months solo, led engineering teams for years, and still codes on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. She finds it hard to imagine a male counterpart with her qualifications receiving the same question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

## Strategies for Success and Influence

Claire adopts a curious and empowered approach to these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. She seeks to understand the structural, cultural, and external factors at play, as well as her own internal contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Her goal is to identify points of leverage to drive progress not just for herself but for the industry broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

### Key Principles for [[being_a_successful_woman_in_tech | Being a Successful Woman in Tech]]

*   **Curiosity and Empowerment:** These have been her path to joy in a complicated industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. She believes in "sitting in your power" and recognizing that "the universe is vendable to your will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.
*   **Normalizing Visibility:** One of the simplest ways to improve the situation is to normalize seeing women in technical and leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. By providing platforms for diverse voices, the industry can broaden its perception of who a software engineer or a technology leader can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.

> "If you close your eyes and imagine a software engineer, my dream is like you imagine a diverse set of folks, you don't imagine a very specific archetype." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>

### Economic Participation and Innovation

Claire views the issue not just as one of individual aspirations but also as crucial for economic participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. She believes that the industry is missing out on significant innovation and economic growth by not having more capable women start companies and lead organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>.

## Selling a Startup While Pregnant

Claire provides a vivid example of [[authenticity_and_success_in_the_tech_industry | bending the universe to her will]] during the sale of her startup, Experiment Engine, to Optimizely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. Recognizing that her niche product had hit a market ceiling, she strategically orchestrated meetings with Microsoft and Optimizely, leveraging her network to get into the right room at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.

During final negotiations, she was 34 weeks pregnant, a situation she shrewdly used as a "ticking time bomb of a belly" for negotiation leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>. This story underscores her belief in scrappiness and finding a way to achieve one's goals, no matter the obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

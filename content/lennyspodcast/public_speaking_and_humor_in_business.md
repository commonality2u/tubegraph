Dharmesh Shah, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot, is known for his unique and ingenious approach to public speaking and keynote preparation, driven by an obsession with comedy and copywriting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.

## Philosophy on Public Speaking

Public speaking does not come naturally to Dharmesh, and it is one of the rare exceptions where he has to do something he is not naturally good at but cannot delegate or avoid as a founder at HubSpot's annual event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. He views public speaking as an [[improving_public_speaking_through_interactive_exercises | acquirable skill]] rather than just a talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:05">[08:05:05]</a>. Talent might affect the learning speed or ceiling, but anyone can learn and improve this skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07">[08:07:07]</a>.

His approach is akin to an engineer's, involving a functional decomposition of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:56">[08:25:56]</a>. He breaks down public speaking into subskills, such as being able to stand on stage without passing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:27">[08:39:27]</a> and holding the audience's attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:27">[08:55:27]</a>. Each year, he focuses on learning a different part of the public speaking skillset, like slide design or visual expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:46">[09:06:46]</a>.

## Measuring Humor with Laughs Per Minute (LPM)

Dharmesh employs a data-driven, quantitative method to assess the effectiveness of his talks, especially for humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. He uses a metric called "Laughs Per Minute" (LPM), which stand-up comedians also use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

For his annual high-stakes keynotes, he:
*   Conducts practice runs in front of increasingly larger live audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
*   Records and transcribes these talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   Uses custom-written software to identify points where the audience audibly laughed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

The software calculates the LPM, providing a benchmark for performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. While stand-up comedians aim for very high LPMs, business talks typically have much lower rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Popular TED Talks, however, show a strong correlation with high LPMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. Dharmesh sets a minimum LPM goal and seeks to improve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

To improve LPM, there are two primary methods:
1.  Adding more laughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
2.  Decreasing the number of words between laughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

The software provides a visual map of the talk, highlighting segments where no laughs occurred for extended periods (e.g., over a minute), prompting either shortening the segment or injecting more humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. This systematic approach underscores that anyone can improve public speaking skills through practice and measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

For business talks, an LPM of 2+ is challenging, but even achieving 1 to 1.25 LPM can put a non-professional speaker in the top decile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. Dharmesh continues to run his transcript and audio through his custom program after every talk to analyze his performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. This software is an example of "SoloWeare," built for personal utility and not intended for broader release due to the complexities of supporting multiple users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.

## Tactical Advice for Humor

Drawing from stand-up comedy, Dharmesh offers two tactical tips for incorporating humor:
1.  **Punchline Placement**: The funny part of a story should be the very last words of that segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. After delivery, stop talking for about half a second to allow the audience to react and give them "permission to laugh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. Continuing to speak immediately after a punchline makes it less funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:44]</a>.
2.  **Multiple Punchlines**: Once time is invested in setting up a story, leverage that context by having multiple funny bits or punchlines within the same narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. This maximizes laughs from the initial setup investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

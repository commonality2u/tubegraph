Andrew Bosworth, widely known as "Boz," joined Facebook in early 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> as one of its first engineers, approximately the 10th engineer, though he notes it was closer to 10th to 16th as several joined on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The early days of the company were far from the glamorous portrayal often seen in movies like *The Social Network* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Intense Work Environment
The period was characterized by significant pain, suffering, and struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Early employees experienced:
*   **Extreme Work Hours** Boz recounts working 120 hours per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> with no hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> leading to weight gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> and unhealthy eating habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Constant Vigilance** Boz did not sleep for more than four hours at a time for about two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. He had to wake up every four hours to check reports and see if anyone was attacking the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This was self-imposed as he built the anti-spam/anti-scraping defense mechanism without 24/7 operations support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Lack of Support Infrastructure** In the early 2000s, there were no dedicated experts or professional support for functions like payroll, finance, IT, or HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Engineers often had to handle tasks like buying components from stores like Fry's Electronics to build new servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Personal Sacrifice** Many early employees lived within a mile of the office and ate most meals together due to the demanding work schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Boz describes sacrificing much of his twenties' social and outgoing fun environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Despite the intensity, there was tremendous camaraderie, and memories were forged in a "forge of really intense times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Key Contributions in the Early Days
During his 18-year tenure, Boz was instrumental in creating several impactful products:
*   **[[development_of_facebooks_news_feed | Facebook News Feed]]** One of his earliest projects, the [[development_of_facebooks_news_feed | News Feed]] was the first algorithmically ranked content feed for any social network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, essentially becoming what people recognize as Facebook today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It was also the very first consumer AI implemented in a website of that kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>. Despite initial user outrage, its usage immediately doubled, demonstrating a "cognitive dissonance" between stated and revealed preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
*   **Mobile Ads Platform** He built the original Facebook mobile ads platform and ran it for four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This work was crucial in saving Facebook's IPO, which had become "pretty grim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   **Core Infrastructure** Boz also helped build and scale the Facebook messaging system, the profile, the timeline, and Facebook Groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Engineering Boot Camp** He even built the internal engineering boot camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

In hindsight, the combination of [[development_of_facebooks_news_feed | News Feed]] and ads creation has generated trillions of dollars in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

## Lessons from the Early Days
Boz emphasizes that while stories of startup success are often romanticized, they rarely capture the immense sacrifice involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. He respects the entrepreneurial drive to take risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, but cautions that it is "not glamorous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> and doesn't always "play out" for those who make the same sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. He recognizes his own luck in joining Facebook when he did, as he wasn't involved in fundraising or board management, allowing him to focus on product and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

A significant personal lesson for Boz was discovering his inherent inclination to be passionate about things. Initially, he resisted working on ads or hardware, seeing himself as an "AI infrastructure product guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a> and a "software guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. However, he found that once he delved into these areas, he became deeply excited by them, likening the ads business to "playing chess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>. This taught him to give himself space to explore new areas and see if he can develop a passion for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. His career path involved frequently changing roles (e.g., integrity, site speed, infrastructure, boot camp, messaging, groups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a> to aggressively learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. He compares this to "wax on, wax off" from Karate Kid, where seemingly disparate experiences ultimately built a comprehensive skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>. This breadth of experience ultimately proved more valuable than a single-track progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

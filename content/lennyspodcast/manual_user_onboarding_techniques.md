## Manual User Onboarding Techniques

Superhuman, an email tool founded by Rahul Vora, initially adopted a "one-to-one concierge onboarding" approach, insisting that every new user go through a manual onboarding experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>. This strategy was considered absolutely the right thing to do in its early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.

### Superhuman's Approach

At its peak, Superhuman had approximately 20 individuals dedicated to conducting manual onboarding sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. This allowed for personalized interaction and deep engagement with early users.

### Why Manual Onboarding?

Superhuman found two primary benefits to this intensive manual onboarding strategy:

1.  **Excellent User Metrics**: Manual onboarding significantly boosted key user metrics such as engagement, retention, [[product_market_fit | product-market fit]] score, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and [[human_interaction_and_personalization_with_ai_models | virality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>. It cultivated an early cohort of "super fans" vital for building a strong brand and fostering true word-of-mouth [[human_interaction_and_personalization_with_ai_models | virality]], which is not dependent on viral mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>.
2.  **Focus on Core Product Development**: In an environment where funding was readily available (e.g., the zero-interest rate phenomenon era), companies could use capital to avoid immediately building a first-time user experience (FTUX) and standard growth loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. This allowed Superhuman's engineers to concentrate their efforts on finding [[product_market_fit | product-market fit]], [[strategies_to_improve_activation_and_onboarding | solution deepening]] (improving the product for existing users), or market widening, rather than expending resources on self-service flows or [[strategies_to_improve_activation_and_onboarding | activation]] processes that humans were already handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>. This contrasted with other companies that might spend nearly half their engineering budget on these self-service flows for products that ultimately failed to achieve [[product_market_fit | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>.

### Scaling and Transitioning Away

While highly effective, manual onboarding is not a permanent solution. Superhuman recognized that at a certain point, it becomes necessary to stop this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

Reasons for the transition included:
*   **User Preference**: Some users preferred not to go through a one-on-one onboarding process. As the user base grew, accommodating these preferences with a world-class self-service option became crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.
*   **Market Width**: The "mass market" (e.g., enterprise clients or a broader range of prosumers) eventually reaches a width where manual onboarding is no longer scalable or cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.
*   **Profitability**: Although Superhuman always ensured profitability with its onboarding, the scaling limits eventually necessitate automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>.

The transition to self-service was described as "nearly impossible" and "terrifying" due to the company's entire DNA being built around manual onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. However, through "a lot of grind and persistence," Superhuman successfully developed a world-class self-service experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>.

Marily Nika, Product Lead at Meta and instructor of a popular Maven course on [[ai_in_product_management | AI and product management]], suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can significantly enhance a product manager's productivity by solving problems in smart ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. She emphasizes that in the future, everything will be AI by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, and all product managers will need to become [[changing_role_of_product_management_with_ai | AI product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## How AI Tools Help Product Managers

AI tools currently available can help product managers perform their jobs better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. They can free up time for product managers to focus on more strategic tasks that are less tedious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. This means AI can make product managers smarter and unlock new areas of product management not yet realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

### Specific Applications of ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can be used in daily workflow to enhance, not replace, a product manager's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Nika uses it extensively in her work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

*   **Crafting Mission Statements:** ChatGPT can rewrite mission statements to be more universally understandable and inspiring for all disciplines, including leadership, junior staff, stakeholders, and even competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Creating User Segments/Personas:** It can generate comprehensive user segments, identifying motivations and pain points that a human might not consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. For example, when asked about interest in a screen-less fitness band, it could suggest "young professionals who don't have enough time" or "people who do not want to charge their devices every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Generating AI-Enhanced Ideas:** ChatGPT can provide ideas for products or features that are enhanced by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Drafting Product Requirements Documents (PRDs):** AI systems can potentially write PRD content, allowing PMs to focus on strategic aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

### No-Code Tools for AI Model Training

Product managers can leverage no-code tools to train AI models without needing to code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **AutoML (Google Cloud):** This tool allows users to train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. It requires a lot of pre-collected and corrected photos/images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. An example application involves using drones to collect images of wind turbines, then using AutoML to identify those needing maintenance, reducing inspection time from weeks to hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

## Integrating AI into Products

Any product can be improved with AI, especially when data on user behavior is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. AI can make products:
*   More secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   Personalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   Enhanced with features like fraud detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
*   More ethical (e.g., in healthcare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>
*   Faster and more accurate (e.g., in shopping for recommendations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>

The key is to change the mindset of PMs, taking a step back and thinking about how to leverage existing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### AI in Product Development Lifecycle
[[ai_in_product_management | AI product development]] is different from regular product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. An [[ai_in_product_management | AI PM]] helps their team and company solve the right problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

[!NOTE]
**Avoid the "Shiny Object Trap"**: Do not pursue AI for the sake of doing AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Instead, identify a problem or pain point that needs a smart solution first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Only then figure out how to implement it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

It is crucial to avoid using AI for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Instead, "fake it" with a Figma prototype to gather user feedback before investing in complex AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. AI should be used when there is already existing data, or data from an adjacent product, that can be leveraged to create something meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

### Collaboration with Research Scientists
[[the_role_of_ai_in_transforming_product_management | Product managers]] will need to become comfortable partnering with research scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. These partnerships aim to produce smart models for automations, personalizations, and recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Many PMs are uncomfortable with the uncertainty inherent in research, where projects might take a year and still be shut down if they don't work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

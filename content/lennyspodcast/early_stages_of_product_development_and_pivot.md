Whiz, co-founded by Ros Herberg (CMO and VP of [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | product strategy]]), experienced unprecedented growth, hitting $100 million ARR just 18 months after its founding, making it the fastest-growing software company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>. This success came despite the founders initially struggling to define their product idea and undergoing a significant [[the_importance_of_pivoting_in_entrepreneurship | pivot]] early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## The Initial Product Idea and Early Customer Engagement

When Ros Herberg joined Whiz as the first product manager, the company was officially founded as "Beyond Networks," with an initial focus on network security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. This direction was contrary to the founding team's background, which was largely in cloud security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

The early days of Whiz, coinciding with the global shutdown in March 2020, involved intense [[customer_engagement_and_product_development | customer engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. The team, including Ros, conducted 10 to 15 meetings daily with potential B2B customers, primarily CISOs (Chief Information Security Officers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. During these calls, they presented their idea using a deck, even without a solid product built yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

Customers often responded with polite interest, saying "Oh, sounds interesting" or "Would love to hear more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. However, despite being the product manager, Ros found herself still confused about "what we were going to build" after weeks of calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

## Recognizing the Need to Pivot

Ros Herberg realized that the team was biased towards seeking positive reinforcement, rather than listening intently for deeper signs of enthusiasm or lack thereof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[00:11:18]</a>. This confusion led her to question what they were actually building, a conversation that prompted a deep discussion among the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[00:10:24]</a>.

> "I still did not exactly understand what we were going to build which was confusing because I was a product manager so I was supposed to to start building it and so at some point I was kind of like I have to ask what exactly are we doing here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>

This open questioning within the company's flat, impact-driven culture enabled the pivotal shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[00:16:04]</a>.

## The Pivot to Cloud Security

The decisive conversation led to a [[the_importance_of_pivoting_in_entrepreneurship | pivot]] away from network security and back to cloud security, an area the founding team knew best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[00:18:19]</a>. This transition immediately changed the dynamic of customer conversations, with a noticeable shift in enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[00:18:34]</a>.

## Signals of Product-Market Fit

With the new focus on cloud security, the customer calls began to show clear signs of product-market fit:

*   **Financial Questions**: Customers started asking about pricing and cost, indicating a serious intent to purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Commitment to Action**: They inquired, "When can we start doing a PO (Proof of Value)?" or "How long is a PO?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Internal Introductions**: Customers would offer to connect the Whiz team to others in their organization, showing a desire to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[00:13:31]</a>.

This "pull" from customers was evident when a Fortune 10 company, interested in a POV, quickly completed a long list of technical questions that Ros had feared would scare them away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[00:19:50]</a>.

> "I love that you're describing what pull looks like somebody's next day filling out a really complicated annoying questionnaire because they just want this product they've never heard of before you chatted with them and now they're like give it to me now I'm going to do anything you need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[00:21:05]</a>

## Lessons Learned from the Pivot

The early phase of [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | product development]] at Whiz provided several critical lessons:

*   **High-Volume Customer Engagement**: Conducting 10-15 calls a day allowed for rapid feedback and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Beware of Polite Affirmation**: Polite "sounds interesting" responses are often misleading; look for tangible signs of commitment and a desire to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **The Power of Asking "What Exactly?"**: Ros Herberg's decision to vocalize her confusion, even when it felt vulnerable, was crucial in uncovering the lack of clarity and initiating the [[the_importance_of_pivoting_in_entrepreneurship | pivot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Founders Should Sell Early**: The founding team closed the first few million dollars in ARR themselves, gaining invaluable insights before hiring a sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[00:21:49]</a>. If the core group cannot sell the product, it's unlikely an external hire will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Embrace Vulnerability**: The culture at Whiz, where it's not a "shame to say 'I don't understand' or 'please explain again'," fostered an environment where critical insights could emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[00:16:04]</a>.

These early experiences, characterized by rapid experimentation and a willingness to acknowledge uncertainty, were foundational to Whiz's explosive growth and success.

Many companies frequently under-resource Search Engine Optimization (SEO) while over-resourcing paid advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For large companies like Zillow or eBay, who might spend tens of millions of dollars on ads, failing to invest significantly in a robust SEO team is illogical given that the organic traffic potential can be comparable to paid traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## When and How to Invest in SEO as a Company

Before allocating resources, it's crucial to evaluate if SEO is a viable growth driver for a given product or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Two primary factors determine this:

1.  **Large Addressable Market**
    Most categories generally have a large addressable market for SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. To assess this, companies should look at competitors (both product and audience competitors) using tools like Similarweb to understand their total traffic and potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The idea is to understand the existing demand that can be "eaten away" by investing in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
2.  **Existing Authority and Traction**
    Google prefers to rank credible domains, not just "SEO sites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. If a company starts from zero with no existing traction, it's generally too soon to invest heavily in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Key signals to look for include:
    *   **Non-SEO Traffic**: Aim for at least 1,000 daily visits from channels other than search (e.g., direct, paid, email, social) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. This indicates brand credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
    *   **Referring Domains**: Have at least 1,000 referring domains (websites linking to yours), indicating more authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

If these benchmarks aren't met, companies can choose to organically build authority or intentionally invest in growth channels that build authority (like content or PR) before doubling down on SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

Ultimately, the decision of [[when_and_how_to_invest_in_seo_as_a_company | when and how to invest in SEO as a company]] should compare its cost and opportunity with other channels like paid advertising or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

## Types and Implementation of SEO

There are three main [[types_and_implementation_of_seo_programmatic_vs_editorial | types and implementation of SEO Programmatic vs Editorial]]:

*   **Programmatic SEO** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>
    *   **Definition**: Pages automatically generated from a database of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: Product pages on eBay, address pages on Zillow, user-generated content (UGC) sites like Glassdoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. It's common for item pages (single items) and category pages (grids/lists of items) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
    *   **Resource Allocation**: While the initial setup can have a high scope, the cost per page is low because pages are auto-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. This requires specialized technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
*   **Editorial SEO** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>
    *   **Definition**: Content (articles, guides, listicles) manually written by a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: MasterClass articles, BetterUp coaching content, NerdWallet financial guides, HubSpot productivity content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
    *   **Resource Allocation**: Every page has a cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. However, editorial SEO is increasingly driving more traffic than programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. It's an opportunity for nearly every company with an addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **Technical SEO** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>
    *   **Definition**: Focuses on the site's underlying infrastructure, including internal link architecture, tags, redirects, and page speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
    *   **Resource Allocation**: Often misunderstood and over-indexed. While important for foundational health, it's not the primary driver of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Technical audits, often just bug lists, are less useful than a holistic growth strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

The best type of SEO to invest in depends on the category and target keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. For most companies, [[programmatic_vs_editorial_seo | editorial SEO]] is the most effective approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. Products with a lot of user-generated content (UGC) or a vast number of SKUs (like e-commerce) benefit greatly from programmatic SEO due to the lower scope of content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## Resource Allocation for SEO Teams

### Hiring Strategies
The approach to hiring depends on the chosen SEO strategy, company stage, opportunity, and budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

*   **Programmatic SEO**: Requires highly specialized individuals who have a strong technical ability and a proven track record of significant SEO growth, especially at lesser-known companies where they've achieved high SEO traffic percentages with limited authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. This person works with engineers to build and maintain systems that automatically generate millions of pages, requiring expertise in indexation logic, taxonomy architecture, and scalable systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.
*   **Editorial SEO**: While not easy, it has a larger talent pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. A "young and hungry" individual with strong content or editorial strategy skills can learn SEO workflows and become effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. The core team for editorial SEO typically consists of an SEO manager (who handles topic selection, outlining, and analysis) and a writer (ideally a domain expert) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.

### Overcoming Blockages and Ensuring Execution
A common issue in SEO is that recommended strategies often don't get launched due to resource constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>. To counter this:

*   **Integrate SEO with Product**: SEO should be part of the product organization, fostering "product-led SEO." This prevents the SEO team from being siloed and ensures SEO initiatives are prioritized as core product changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.
*   **Executive Buy-in**: Secure executive-level buy-in to ensure SEO initiatives receive necessary resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.
*   **Demystify SEO**: The perceived mystery around SEO can lead to under-prioritization. Clear communication of expected impact and scope can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:55">[01:07:55]</a>.
*   **Acknowledge Scope**: SEO is a lot of work, especially at scale. Acknowledging its high scope is critical for proper resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>.

### Timeframes and Leading Indicators
While SEO is often perceived as a long-term investment (6-9 months for results) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>, larger sites with existing authority can see results in weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

Companies should look for early leading indicators within the first few months, such as ranking within the top 20 for target keywords, even if clicks are minimal initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. Seeing progress (e.g., moving from position 15 to 8) indicates that the strategy is working and it's time to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

## Key Elements of an Effective SEO Strategy

[[key_elements_of_an_effective_seo_strategy | Key elements of an effective SEO strategy]] involve a systematic workflow:

1.  **Define Addressable Market & Topics**: Identify the topics and keywords to target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. This requires [[evaluating_seo_opportunities_for_businesses | evaluating SEO opportunities for businesses]] by analyzing competitors' top pages and keywords using tools like Ahrefs or Semrush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.
2.  **Determine Page Type**: Based on keyword research, determine the optimal page type (e.g., article, category page, product page) by observing what Google is already ranking for similar queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. The goal is to provide the most useful content for the user's intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.
3.  **Develop Content Strategy**: Define the subtopics and themes needed for each page type to ensure comprehensive content coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Thinking in "topics" (clusters of 200-2,000 keywords) rather than individual keywords is crucial for better search volume estimation and content efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
4.  **Optimize Infrastructure (Technical SEO)**: Ensure Google can easily find and crawl all pages via effective internal linking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

### Importance of Internal Links
Internal linking is a consistently undervalued and effective SEO lever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. Pages with more internal links tend to receive more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. Google crawls sites through links, and a lack of internal links means Google won't find or crawl pages regularly enough to give them credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. Ideally, pages should have at least 10 internal links and be few "hops" away from prominent crawl points like the homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. Links within the main body of content are more valuable than navigational or footer links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>. Fixing poor internal link spread can lead to significant traffic increases (25% or even 100% in some cases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>.

### Topical Authority
Beyond just links, Google assesses a site's overall authority based on multiple inputs:
*   **External Links**: The more links from other sites, the more important a domain is perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>.
*   **Non-SEO Traffic**: Traffic from other channels (direct, social, paid) signals credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.
*   **Social Shares**: Activity on social media indicates content relevance and reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.
*   **Branded Search**: The number of times users search for a brand name directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>.

Crucially, this authority is now **topical** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. Google prioritizes sites known for specific, narrow expertise rather than general knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. The content of backlinks (anchor text), what gets shared, and branded searches related to specific topics all contribute to building this [[key_elements_of_an_effective_seo_strategy | topical authority]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>. This allows newer companies to outrank larger competitors in specific niches where they have disproportionate authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>.

## AI and SEO

While AI (like GPT-3) can generate grammatically correct sentences, its output often lacks factual accuracy or underlying wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>. Therefore, directly generating content with AI for sensitive topics (e.g., finance, health) is generally not recommended as it can be misleading and unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

However, AI is highly valuable for the *pre-writing* stages of content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:33">[01:27:33]</a>. It can efficiently:
*   Cluster thousands of keywords into coherent topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>.
*   Identify relevant subtopics for comprehensive content outlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>.
*   Sort topics by expected performance and determine topical authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.

This allows human writers, who are domain experts and possess wisdom, to create high-quality content based on an AI-generated, data-driven structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>. This approach leverages [[seo_transformations_with_the_rise_of_ai | SEO transformations with the rise of AI]] effectively.

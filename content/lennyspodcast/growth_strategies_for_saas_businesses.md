This article explores growth strategies for SaaS businesses, drawing insights from Melton Koron Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, a global payroll, HR, and compliance platform that achieved remarkable growth from zero to $300 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in three years while remaining EBITDA positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>. Deel is considered one of the fastest-growing SaaS businesses of all time, possibly even faster than Ramp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>.

## Foundational Growth Principles
In the early days of a business, it is crucial to focus on the basics and build a strong foundation before expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
A primary focus should be on the company's website:
*   Ensure you have a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   Make sure it is fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Confirm that search engines recognize its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

Only after these foundational questions are addressed should a business consider investing in paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. A successful paid ads program cannot run effectively if the website loads slowly, for instance, in four or more seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The core focus should be on creating a good user experience and then expanding step-by-step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

A common mistake is that B2B statements can often apply to 90% of other B2B businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. Messaging should be specific enough that it cannot easily apply to another business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Early on at Deel, the website was hard-coded, and a priority was to move it to a platform that allowed for easy A/B testing of value propositions like problem-first, solution-first, time savings, and cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

## Cost-Effective Growth Channels
For [[b2b_growth_strategies | B2B growth strategies]], cheaper growth channels often involve solving active problems and answering people's questions, rather than directly selling to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. These channels provide value first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Community Engagement
Leveraging existing communities is a highly effective, low-cost strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This includes:
*   **Reddit**: Monitoring keywords on subreddits related to your industry (e.g., Founders, HR managers) allows you to find people asking questions and provide answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Deel actively used this strategy from its early days, setting up keyword tracking to identify questions about international hiring or HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It's important to remember that these communities might have an upper limit to their audience size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Quora**: Similar to Reddit, Quora is a platform where users seek answers to specific questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Twitter**: People often ask questions to their communities on Twitter, creating opportunities for value-add responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Closed Communities**: Platforms like Slack or Discord, or exclusive groups like those for Y Combinator alumni, can be valuable if access can be gained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Add Value First
> When engaging with communities, the most important rule is to add value, not just promote your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Provide a genuine answer to their question first, then present your solution as a fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Deel's team members and co-founders personally answered questions on these platforms, never automating the interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
SEO is critical, especially for [[b2b_growth_strategies | B2B growth strategies]] that solve active problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
*   **Focus on Search Intent**: The biggest mistake is simply stuffing keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The goal is to end the user's search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. If someone reads your content after a Google search, they should not need to go back to Google for more answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   **Operational Approach**: Deel's content team operates more like an operational team than a creative one, with a clear framework for publishing decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   **Traffic Light System**: Deel uses a "traffic light system" to prioritize content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
    1.  Identify up to 700 keywords related to the business (closely or distantly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
    2.  Rank them by highest to lowest search volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
    3.  Assess user intent for each keyword:
        *   **Green Light**: High intent, person likely to become a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
        *   **Yellow Light**: Possible intent, 50/50 chance they are looking to buy soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
        *   **Red Light**: No intent to buy, just searching for other reasons (e.g., university student for an article) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
    4.  Prioritize green light keywords (highest volume first), then yellow, often never getting to red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Content Creation Process**:
    *   Understand search intent by researching what Google is currently servicing for that keyword (e.g., "eor" is often "enhanced oil recovery," not "employer of record") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
    *   Utilize "People also ask" sections on Google to understand follow-up questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
    *   Use SEO tools (like Clearscope) to ensure content is simple, understandable (e.g., 4th-grade reading level), and uses keywords correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
*   **Team Structure**: Deel's content team is led by a director, includes an operations person managing freelancers, briefs, fact-checking, and publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Other members focus on different product lines or new content types (video, education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. The team is about eight full-time people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **Commitment**: SEO is time-consuming and cannot be fully automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. Cutting corners results in low-quality resources that users will not read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] IRS Link
> In a previous role, a Deel employee wrote a blog post about the PPP program during COVID-19, which the IRS eventually linked to as a definitive resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>. This demonstrates how providing valuable answers can lead to significant traffic and recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

### Strategic Partnerships
When forming partnerships, it's crucial to identify not just shared audiences, but also whether the partner is a trusted resource for guidance on your specific solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. For Deel, partnerships with Venture Capital firms were significant because VCs are often asked for recommendations on platforms when their portfolio companies expand globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

## Paid Advertising Strategies
Once the foundational elements are in place, a business can invest in paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.
*   **Long-Tail Platforms**: After covering major ad platforms, focus on long-tail opportunities. These are platforms that individually don't contribute a huge chunk of leads, but collectively, they can make up about 30% of overall lead flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. Examples include review sites, smaller outlets, newsletter ads, and podcast ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.
*   **Creative Fatigue**: Continuously update ad creatives to prevent creative fatigue. Deel's paid team updates ads monthly, except for some straight-to-the-point Google ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>. Messaging must also evolve with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.
*   **Revenue-Focused Metrics**: Do not solely focus on lead volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. It's critical to track how many leads convert into clients and the actual revenue generated from those clients over time (e.g., one year out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. This allows for proper budgeting and understanding of payback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. Deel uses a data team dashboard to track conversion rates from lead to qualified opportunity to closed-won, and average revenue per customer from each channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Awareness Campaigns
> For [[b2b_growth_strategies | B2B growth strategies]], avoid early awareness campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. They require significant time and resources without guaranteed resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. As B2B products solve real problems, prioritize tapping into the "bottom of the funnel" (people ready to convert) first, which can take 6-8 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. Awareness campaigns are best for continuous reinforcement once a brand is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

## The Role of Product Quality in Growth
All acquisition channels are ineffective if the product does not meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. In the B2B world, customers will not tolerate poor products; they will leave, and negative word-of-mouth will spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>. Deel's product was top-notch from day one, so much so that they sometimes had to temper their messaging for people to believe the product's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. When joining a young company, it's wise to inquire about the team breakdown: a strong core business should have a majority of product and engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>.

## Team Building and Culture for Growth
Building a growth team requires careful consideration of skills and cultural fit.

### Hiring Priorities
*   **Commitment to Revenue KPIs**: Hire individuals willing to commit to closed-won revenue goals, not just lead numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. Ask about past committed KPIs and what they *think* their KPIs should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **"Little Hands" Mentality**: People should be willing to do the "dirty work" and nitty-gritty tasks, regardless of their seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. Avoid hiring from large companies if the person is not used to operating with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.
*   **Scaling Mindset**: Test candidates by asking them to devise strategies with varying budgets (e.g., zero, $10,000, $100,000) to see if they can scale and commit to bottom-of-funnel metrics without extensive resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

### Early Growth Team Structure
Deel's early growth team was built by first bringing in one leader to manage a part of the organization, then letting them grow their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
*   **First Hire**: A product marketing person, who was responsible for setting messaging between product and go-to-market teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>.
*   **Second Hire**: A talented copywriter to lead creative teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.
*   **Third Hire**: A data analyst, demonstrating a commitment to measuring ROI from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.
*   **Content Person**: Already at the company (an early employee) when the Head of Growth joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.

### Current Team Structure
Deel currently uses a hybrid structure:
*   **Functional Teams**: Subject matter experts (e.g., product marketing, content, community, events, paid ads, brand) that can be based anywhere in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. This ensures best practices and skill leveling are maintained as technical roles sit together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.
*   **Regional Teams**: Marketing managers for different key regions who work with the functional teams to execute strategies, providing local expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. Resource allocation to regions is based on total addressable market, opportunities, and competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.

### Company Culture
Deel's culture is shaped by what team members contribute and what the company provides in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>. Core values, though formalized later, existed organically through actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
*   **Deal Speed**: A strong emphasis on urgency, acting quickly for customers and building products at an accelerated pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. This sense of urgency is vital and fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.
*   **Default Optimism**: Maintaining a positive outlook, focusing on how problems *can* be solved rather than why they won't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. This fosters proactivity in solving risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.
*   **Customer Care**: Recognizing the human element in their work, dealing with people's livelihoods (paychecks, legal compliance) makes customer care incredibly personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: In return, Deel offers flexibility, allowing employees to choose where and when they work, promoting an authentic work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.

> [!INFO] Remote Work Example
> Deel's Head of Growth, based in Canada, worked for a year and a half before meeting many team members in person due to pandemic restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>. This remote setup, where people shared glimpses of their authentic lives (pets, partners, or even working from an ironing board) fostered camaraderie and sincerity within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

Growth is simpler than often perceived; it requires discipline, not rocket science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. The core is finding where people are, adding value, and ensuring your product truly serves their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>.

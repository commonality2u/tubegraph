The idea of being [[the_value_of_distinctiveness_and_fame_in_branding|remarkable]] is crucial for companies, particularly in crowded markets like the AI industry, where distinguishing oneself is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. AI will soon cease to be a distinguishing feature, much like electricity is not a feature for modern appliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Therefore, companies, including AI companies, need to articulate what value they offer to the user and make a "difficult promise" or a "[[the_value_of_distinctiveness_and_fame_in_branding|remarkable]] promise," then consistently deliver on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

## Defining "Remarkable"

The term "[[the_value_of_distinctiveness_and_fame_in_branding|remarkable]]" means "worth making a remark about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. It's not about creating ridiculous, gimmickry, or viral videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. Instead, it's about building a product or service where the user's life genuinely improves if they discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. If the creator knows in advance what they want people to say about their product, it increases the likelihood of that message being spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

## Importance of Word-of-Mouth and Network Effect

A key indicator of a startup's potential is [[elements_of_breakthrough_startup_ideas|customer traction]]: whether users remain engaged, return for more, and tell their friends about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. If a product is designed to foster a network effect—where it works better for users if they share it with others—then the marketing problem is largely solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

### Examples of Remarkability

*   **Google's Homepage**: Marissa Mayer's insistence on only two buttons on Google's homepage, unlike Yahoo's 183 links, communicated a promise: "We are smart enough to take you where you want to go without you spending a lot of time browsing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. This simplicity made the product "[[the_value_of_distinctiveness_and_fame_in_branding|remarkable]]" because it delivered on its promise and encouraged users to recommend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **Microsoft Word**: It became [[the_value_of_distinctiveness_and_fame_in_branding|remarkable]] because it offered a necessary format for modern computer users, encouraging migration from competitors like Word Perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.
*   **Tesla Model S**: The noticeable, albeit sometimes annoying, pop-out door handles sparked conversations in parking lots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. This led owners to invite people into the car and showcase "ludicrous mode," providing a transformative and shareable experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.

## Avoiding Non-Remarkable Strategies

*   **Absurd Promises**: Making overblown promises might appeal to venture capitalists but will fail with consumers, as promises can only be broken once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Chat GPT's reputation, for example, suffers from regularly overpromising and under-delivering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. In contrast, Claude's approach of bringing "kindness and humility" by being clear when it doesn't know something, builds a stronger [[creative_branding_strategies_for_startups|brand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
*   **Gimmickry**: Creating buzz through tactics like a car company rebranding its logo (as Jaguar did) without a corresponding shift in core product promise is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. Similarly, stunts like the International House of Pancakes changing its name for buzz, or Oreo's Super Bowl tweet, don't necessarily translate to increased sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.
*   **Divisiveness**: The Tesla Cybertruck, designed to be intentionally divisive, is unlikely to achieve broad adoption in a category like pickup trucks, where buyers are inherently skeptical of change and "design trickery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. It fails to serve the utility narrative that defines the pickup truck market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.

## Conclusion

Being [[the_value_of_distinctiveness_and_fame_in_branding|remarkable]] involves making a "difficult promise" and consistently keeping it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. It requires a [[creative_approaches_to_building_beloved_b2b_products|product]] that inherently encourages word-of-mouth because it genuinely improves the user's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. This strategic choice is fundamental to a company's [[Developing Differentiated Value|differentiated value]] and long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

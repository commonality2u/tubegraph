Generative [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] is anticipated to have a significant [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | impact on product development]] and the product management field, creating both uncertainty and disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. The CEO of Nvidia even stated, "don't learn programming," highlighting the potential for widespread disruption across various roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

## Current and Future Impacts
[[Current trends and challenges in AI product management | Techniques in product management]] are undergoing radical changes due to generative [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. This technology is expected to compound the "reckoning" for product owners on delivery teams and product managers on feature teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. While the full timeline is uncertain, the [[impact_of_ai_and_machine_learning_on_product_development | impact]] is considered very real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

### Vulnerable Skills and Roles
Generative [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] is expected to disrupt various skills, particularly in engineering and design, with product management likely to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. Specifically, the role of a backlog administrator is seen as having poor job prospects because [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] will increasingly support such tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>. Similarly, many administrative activities performed by feature team project managers are vulnerable to [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.

### Role of the Empowered Product Manager
For an empowered product manager, whose responsibilities are value and viability, the remaining challenge is primarily viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. Questions related to probabilistic software, legal implications, ethical considerations, and mission-critical applications are increasingly landing on the product manager's plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

## [[Leveraging AI tools in product management | Using Generative AI Tools]]
Marty Kagan's advice on [[leveraging_ai_tools_in_product_management | using generative AI]] for product management has evolved. Initially, he recommended starting with tools like Chat GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>. However, he observed that people were taking the [[ai_in_product_management | AI]]'s output "too literally, too seriously, too much value," leading them in wrong directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

His updated recommendation for [[leveraging_ai_tools_in_product_management | using generative AI]] is to:
1.  **Think through the answer first** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
2.  **Put something down** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
3.  **Then use Chat GPT** to improve, challenge, or make the argument tighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.

Generative [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] can be applied to various tasks, including creating specs (PRDs), developing strategy, and even aiding in bug fixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.

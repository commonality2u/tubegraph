While engineering often lacks a clear, written strategy, one always exists, even if it's implicit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. The primary challenge is that these strategies are often not documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.

> [!INFO] Importance of Documenting Strategy
> Writing down a strategy allows for its improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>. Without documentation, it's difficult to debug issues like misapplied strategies or misunderstandings across different organizational layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Good Strategy
Good strategy, including [[strategies_for_setting_and_deploying_effective_product_strategies | strategy in general]], can sometimes appear "boring" because it focuses on clear, often restrictive guidelines that direct energy towards company values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. The goal of a good strategy is not to please everyone, but to guide the investment of limited resources into critical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

### Components of Strategy
Richard Rumelt's definition of strategy includes three main components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>:
1.  **Diagnosis**
    *   Understanding the current status quo and existing realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>.
    *   Bad strategies often stem from a "willful disbelief" of an accurate diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>.
2.  **Guiding Policies**
    *   How to address the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a>.
    *   These policies clarify how future decisions should be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>.
3.  **Actions**
    *   Steps to implement the guiding policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.
    *   It addresses concerns about "inert strategy" where policies are decided but never implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:42">[01:41:42]</a>.

### Core Principles for Effective Strategy
When defining [[key_elements_of_a_successful_strategy | strategy]], particularly for company values, three principles are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>:
*   **Honesty**: The strategy should reflect what the company actually does, not just what it aspires to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>.
*   **Applicability**: Values should be directly usable in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:33">[01:57:33]</a>.
*   **Reversibility**: A good value should have a clear opposite, meaning it guides specific choices rather than being a universally agreeable but unhelpful statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:01">[01:59:01]</a>. Values that are just "identity values" (e.g., "we build good software," "we care about our customers") are not very useful because they don't help teams make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:30">[01:59:30]</a>.

## Examples of Engineering Strategies
*   **Adopting a "Standard Kit" of Tools**: At Carta, a strategy exists to use only the tools already in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. This forces engineers to focus their energy on core company problems rather than exploring new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a>.
*   **Uber's "No Cloud" Policy**: During the era Will Larson was at Uber (around 2014), the company strictly used its own data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. While challenging, this allowed Uber to spin up operations quickly in places like China without relying on external cloud providers' presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.
*   **Stripe's "Ruby Monolith" Strategy**: Stripe's policy of maintaining a Ruby monolith, though it has evolved, directed engineers to build innovative features for users rather than developing new tooling for various programming languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.

A common theme across these examples is **constraint**; purposely limiting options to foster faster movement and focus on essential problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a>.

## Improving Engineering Strategy
To improve [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | engineering strategy]] or [[strategies_for_setting_and_deploying_effective_product_strategies | strategy in general]]:
*   **Read "Good Strategy Bad Strategy" by Richard Rumelt**: This book offers a comprehensive understanding of strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">[01:38:38]</a>.
*   **Study "Thinking in Systems: A Primer" by Donella Meadows**: [[systems_thinking_in_engineering | Systems thinking]] is crucial for modeling reality to improve strategic diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>.
*   **Explore Engineering-specific Strategy Books**:
    *   "Technology Strategy Patterns" by Evan Hitt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:05">[01:26:05]</a>
    *   "The Value Flywheel Effect" by Anderson, McConnel, and O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>
    *   "The Phoenix Project" by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:13">[01:26:13]</a>

### Aligning Engineering to Business Goals
A key aspect of [[building_a_productoriented_engineering_culture | building a product-oriented engineering culture]] and effective strategy is aligning engineering evaluation with business and product goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>. This means holding engineering accountable to product goals, recognizing that their role is to support the product and customers, not just to build novel systems for their own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:35">[01:51:35]</a>.

### Empowering Engineers
Instead of treating engineers "like children," they should be treated as peers and given senior leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means not sheltering them from important problems but rather allowing them to tackle complex challenges and be held accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach can lead to growth opportunities and allow engineers to achieve what they've been seeking in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

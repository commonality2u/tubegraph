Eric Ries, creator of the Lean Startup methodology, currently dedicates his time to advising founders and startups, serving as founder and executive chairman of the Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. His work is increasingly influenced by [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]], particularly its implications for governance and corporate structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:02">[06:02:02]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape of [[impact_ai_on_product_development | AI in Product Development]]

Ries observes that [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]] is ushering in a significant phase for humanity, technology, and civilization, requiring empirical knowledge that currently nobody possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. He emphasizes that fears surrounding [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]] are often misplaced; the real concern should be about corporations deploying [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]] with misaligned human values, as [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]] itself doesn't act independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>.

### [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development_roles | AI as a Management Technology]]
Ries views [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]] as a "management technology" that governs intelligence, noting its potential to significantly alter management practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39">[01:37:39]</a>. He highlights that [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]] can drastically change an individual's span of control, streamlining information summarization that traditionally required extensive human labor and hierarchical structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:32">[01:38:32]</a>.

He provides examples of how [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]] agents can get stuck in infinite loops of task delegation or research, similar to challenges faced by middle managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>. However, [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]]'s strength in summarization could enable CEOs to grasp complex company-wide activities with ease, reducing the need for numerous intermediary managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.

### Real-world Applications and Opportunities
Ries shares an early example of GPT-4 being used for automated, personalized cold sales outreach to Shopify store owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35">[01:27:35]</a>. This demonstrates the potential for hyper-fast [[strategies_for_fast_product_development_in_startups | experimentation]] and wildly creative approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:11">[01:28:11]</a>.

However, he warns that this capability will lead to a saturation of communication channels with [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]]-generated content, necessitating [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]]-powered email clients for filtering and summarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>. Optimistically, this could lead to more equitable [[impact_of_design_on_business_growth | AI]]-powered marketplaces where transactions are based purely on merit rather than human biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.

He highlights the emergence of science fiction-like companies working on advanced technologies like one-hour transcontinental travel, weather changing, nanomaterials, quantum computing, and biological [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]] that can synthesize molecules based on natural language descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:11">[01:33:11]</a>. These ventures hold immense promise but also carry significant risks.

### Ethical Considerations and Uncertainty
The debate between [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]] leading to utopia or dystopia creates paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:52">[01:23:52]</a>. Given the inherent uncertainty and the lack of empirical answers about [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]]'s future, Ries suggests focusing on actions that make ethical sense across a wide range of potential scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>. This includes promoting transparency, building capacity, and cultivating competent leadership and values-driven companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:13">[01:26:13]</a>.

## Connecting [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]] to Lean Startup Principles

### Experimentation at Scale
[[strategies_for_fast_product_development_in_startups | AI]] enables unprecedented levels of [[strategies_for_fast_product_development_in_startups | experimentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:34">[01:28:34]</a>. Ries emphasizes that a fundamental lesson of the scientific method is that "if you can't fail, you can't learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>. This principle is crucial in the face of [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]]'s uncertainty, where scientific and experimental approaches are vital for coping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>.

### The Need for Strong Governance
Ries believes that [[how_ai_is_changing_the_startup_landscape_and_opportunities_for_innovation | AI]] will force companies to take issues of governance and alignment seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>. He argues that tech companies have historically [[impact_of_company_culture_on_product_development | underinvested]] in governance structures, leading to disappointments and a sense of betrayal among those who helped build them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:14">[01:30:14]</a>.

Organizations, seen as "superorganisms" with their own "soul" and "life," must embed promises and values into their fundamental structure to be trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:45">[01:34:45]</a>. This means ensuring that even if a founder is replaced, the company's core mission and values remain intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:15">[01:35:15]</a>.

This aligns with Ries's work on the Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE), which aims to foster companies committed to long-term value creation and human flourishing, rather than short-term financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>. He challenges the notion that maximizing shareholder returns is the sole purpose of a company, arguing that it often leads to value destruction and short-sightedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:48">[01:53:48]</a>. The LTSE model and similar structures (e.g., public benefit corporations, foundation-controlled companies like OpenAI) demonstrate that embedding purpose into governance can lead to stronger financial performance and a more positive societal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>.

Ries encourages founders to proactively consider and implement governance structures that protect their company's soul and mission from external pressures, rather than waiting until it's "too late" during later growth stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:52">[01:53:52]</a>. He believes that by setting these terms, founders can create businesses that change the world for the better and achieve greater, more sustainable success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:06">[02:13:06]</a>.

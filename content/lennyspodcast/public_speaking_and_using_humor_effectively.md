Daresh Shaw, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot, shares his unique and data-driven approach to [[improving_public_speaking_skills | public speaking]], particularly his methods for incorporating and measuring humor in his keynotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. He emphasizes that public speaking is not a natural talent for him, but an acquirable skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:07">[06:56:07]</a>.

## Daresh Shaw's Philosophy on Public Speaking

### Talent vs. Skill
Shaw believes that while talent influences the "slope of the curve" for learning, most abilities are acquirable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:05">[08:04:05]</a>. This means that even if someone has a natural talent for music and learns faster with a higher ceiling, others can still learn music as an acquirable skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07">[08:07:07]</a>. This philosophy extends to [[improving_public_speaking_skills | public speaking]], which he views as a skill that can be learned and improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:04">[07:42:04]</a>.

### Functional Decomposition
To approach [[improving_public_speaking_skills | public speaking]] as a skill, Shaw uses a process of "functional decomposition," breaking it down into underlying sub-skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:06">[08:28:06]</a>. The most basic requirement is to stand on stage without passing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:09">[08:39:09]</a>. For high-stakes speaking, the goal is to hold the audience's attention, as the message won't matter if attention is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

Each year, he focuses on a different aspect of [[techniques_for_enhancing_public_speaking_skills | public speaking techniques]], such as slide design or visual expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:07">[09:06:07]</a>. The area that has had the most impact for him is humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:04">[09:16:04]</a>.

## The Role of Humor

Shaw's obsession with comedy and [[crafting_compelling_presentations | keynote prep]] involves a unique approach to humor, slide design, and story arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:03">[06:40:03]</a>.

### Laughs Per Minute (LPM)
He uses a metric from stand-up comedians called Laughs Per Minute (LPM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. To prepare for his annual high-stakes keynotes, he does practice runs with live audiences, records them, and has them transcribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:05">[09:53:05]</a>. He then uses custom software to identify points where the audience audibly laughed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:02">[10:13:02]</a>.

Stand-up comedians have a very high LPM, while business talks typically have a very low LPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:04">[10:33:04]</a>. There's a strong correlation between popular TED Talks and high LPMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:02">[10:39:02]</a>. His goal is to achieve a minimum LPM of 2+ for a business talk, which is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:01">[10:42:01]</a>, and to continuously improve this metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:03">[10:43:03]</a>. For most normal circumstances, an LPM above 1 or 1.25 puts a non-professional speaker in the top decile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:09">[14:06:09]</a>.

The software also provides a visual map of the talk, showing minutes where no one laughed, prompting him to either shorten the segment or inject more humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:02">[11:06:02]</a>.

## Tactical Humor Delivery

To improve LPM, there are two primary methods:
1.  Add more laughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:04">[10:58:04]</a>.
2.  Decrease the number of words between laughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:09">[11:00:09]</a>.

Specifically for [[conversational_public_speaking_techniques | conversational public speaking techniques]] and incorporating humor:

*   **Punchline Placement**: The funny bit of a story should be the *literal last words* of that segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:02">[12:26:02]</a>. After delivering the punchline, the speaker must stop talking to allow the audience about half a second to react and grant them permission to laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:04">[12:34:04]</a>. Continuing to speak will make the audience feel awkward and diminish the humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple Funny Bits**: Once context is established for a story, incorporate multiple punchlines or funny bits to maximize laughs from the same setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:02">[13:06:02]</a>. This leverages the initial investment in setting up the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:02">[13:12:02]</a>.

## Continuous Improvement and Solo-ware

Shaw's approach to learning, including [[improving_public_speaking_skills | public speaking]], is rooted in continuous improvement through practice and measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:02">[11:36:02]</a>. He advocates for learning by doing, suggesting people find a problem they care about and try to solve it using the new skill or technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.

He often builds "solo-ware" â€“ software designed for exactly one person (himself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:02">[14:31:02]</a>. This allows for simplicity, minimal testing, and the ability to easily discontinue use if it no longer provides utility, without disappointing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:04">[14:46:04]</a>. His LPM software is an example of such solo-ware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:02">[14:49:02]</a>.

Ultimately, his ability to learn and excel at [[improving_public_speaking_skills | public speaking]] demonstrates that nearly anything can be learned through consistent [[importance_of_practicing_public_speaking | practice]] and objective measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:04">[11:33:04]</a>.

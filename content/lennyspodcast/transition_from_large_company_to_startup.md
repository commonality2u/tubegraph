Ravi Mehta, co-founder and CEO of Outpace, former Chief Product Officer at Tinder, Product Director at Facebook, and VP of Product at TripAdvisor, shares insights on the differences and challenges of transitioning from a large company product leadership role to a startup founder position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. After spending about 10 years at larger companies, he missed "building something new" and "thinking about where things are going" without the legacy constraints of big businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Key Differences and Surprises in the Transition

Mehta identifies several significant shifts in mindset required for this transition:

### Speed vs. Latency
A common misconception is that startups are inherently faster than larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Initially, things might feel slower at a startup due to fewer engineers, less established teams, and lack of momentum from existing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

The true advantage of a smaller company lies in **latency**, not velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Velocity** refers to the quantity of work that can be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Larger companies can achieve more velocity by spending more and moving faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Latency** is how quickly you can go from an idea to testing it and learning if it was the right idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Startups can have an idea one day and test it the next, enabling very short cycle times between hypothesis and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Mehta uses a car analogy: a fast-moving car (large company) cannot turn as quickly, while a startup has a "really tight turning radius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This requires boiling down ambitious plans into smaller, iterative pieces to get data frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This concept is crucial for [[balancing_startup_agility_and_big_company_operations | balancing startup agility and big company operations]].

### Decision-Making Approach: Conviction vs. Experimentation
Large companies with big audiences often rely on an experimental approach to decision-making, running A/B tests to determine what users want based on statistically significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Startups, lacking a large user base, cannot effectively use this experimental approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Attempts to do so can lead to slow, invalid results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Instead, startups must adopt a **conviction-oriented approach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. The focus shifts to asking: "Do we just have enough data to have informed conviction and we should move forward and stop digging?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This avoids paralysis by analysis and encourages quick execution based on conviction, followed by rapid iteration or a shift in direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Professional Networks
The professional networks for large companies and startups are "pretty different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. People often build careers around a particular stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Large Company Professionals**: Often prefer the benefits and specific problem types of big companies, focusing on going deeper into their craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Senior leaders might not want to write code or specs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Early-Stage Professionals**: Tend to be more generalist, comfortable with performing a wide range of tasks, including "writing codes and specs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This network includes founders, freelancers, investors, and angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

Even marketing and growth strategies differ between stages; large companies leverage bigger budgets, while early-stage companies often rely on "hacker" approaches using new distribution channels or niche techniques (e.g., TikTok, SEO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Founders at Large Companies

For those currently at big tech companies like Facebook or Google with aspirations to start a company in the future, Mehta offers [[practical_advice_for_earlystage_founders | practical advice for early-stage founders]]:

*   **Plug into an early-stage network as soon as possible** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This allows connecting with builders and entrepreneurs interested in development, operations, and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Connect with angels and investors** to understand early-stage company trends and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   **Foster networks** related to early-stage growth and marketing, which require different skill sets than those in larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

### Recommended Communities:
*   **Indie Hacker Community**: Ideal for those thinking about building something solo, as it focuses on individuals who are entirely generalistsâ€”both "builders and sellers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Everything Marketplaces**: Founded by Mike, this community brings together founders, especially those focused on marketplace businesses, offering events and curated experiences for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

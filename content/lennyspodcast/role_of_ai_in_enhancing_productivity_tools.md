Rahul Vora, founder and CEO of Superhuman, discusses the significant [[impact of ai on product development | impact of AI on product development]] and how it has revolutionized their email platform, leading to increased product velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. He notes that companies with AI strategies might experience a "zero interest rate phenomenon era" of funding, where capital is more readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:31">[05:31:31]</a>.

## Superhuman's Flagship AI Features

Superhuman has launched multiple AI features designed to enhance user productivity and streamline email management:

*   **Write with AI** Users can jot down a few words, and the AI will generate a full email, matching the user's voice and tone from previously sent emails. This feature is highly popular, with users averaging 37 uses per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. This contrasts with tools like Copilot or Gemini, which do not personalize the tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.
*   **Auto Summarize** This feature provides a one-line summary above every conversation, updating instantly as new emails arrive. Unlike other tools, these summaries are precomputed, offering a premium and seamless experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>.
*   **Instant Reply** Superhuman can automatically draft replies to emails, allowing users to simply edit and send, or sometimes send without any edits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>. The percentage of AI-written and sent emails with Superhuman increased fourfold in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.
*   **Ask AI** Leveraging email as a "treasure trove of critical information," this feature allows users to query their inbox naturally, asking questions like "Where is the Q1 offsite?" or "What are my flight details?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>. Tasks that previously took 20-30 minutes can now be completed in under 5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>.
*   **Auto Labels** Users can create short prompts (e.g., "job applications" or "requests to review work"), and AI will automatically label incoming emails that match these criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.
*   **Auto Reminders** For emails requiring a response, Superhuman automatically sets a reminder, ensuring users "never drop the ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>.
*   **Autodrafts** Superhuman drafts follow-up emails and will soon draft replies for almost every email that needs a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>.
*   **Workflows** This feature enables users to automate repeatable email processes by creating flowcharts of actions. For example, a founder receiving job applications can automate replies to candidates and forward messages with resumes to the HR team, even while on vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>.

## Learnings from AI Integration

Rahul Vora notes that the user adoption and love for particular AI features have been unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>. While "Write with AI" might seem like a commodity, its high usage (37 times per user per week) was a significant surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. Conversely, some AI features expected to have high usage did not achieve the anticipated adoption rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>. This highlights the unpredictable nature of user preferences when [[leveraging ai in product development | leveraging AI in product development]].

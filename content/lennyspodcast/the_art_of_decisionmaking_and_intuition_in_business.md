Jason Fried, co-founder and CEO of 37signals (creators of Basecamp and HEY), advocates for a distinctive approach to business rooted in intuition, constraints, and a long-term perspective focused on sustainability rather than aggressive growth or eventual acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>. His philosophy challenges conventional wisdom, particularly in the tech industry, emphasizing the importance of staying small, prioritizing profit over revenue, and trusting one's [[the_role_of_intuition_and_longterm_vision_in_decisionmaking | gut and instinct]] in [[examples_and_advice_on_decisionmaking_frameworks_for_managers_and_leaders | decision-making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>.

## Contrarian Business Philosophy: Bootstrapping and Longevity

Fried's company, 37signals, operates with no investors, no board, no plans to go public, and no intention to sell the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. They have been profitable for 24 years in a row, generating tens of millions of dollars in profit annually with over 100,000 customers and approximately 75 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This stands in stark contrast to many venture-backed companies that prioritize rapid growth at the expense of profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

Fried argues that while the venture route might be necessary for businesses requiring significant capital expenditures (like building cars or opening restaurants), it is often detrimental for software businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25">[07:25]</a>. Software should naturally have healthy margins (close to 80-90%), but the venture model often leads to unprofitable companies due to excessive spending on people and customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00">[08:00]</a>.

### The "Stayup" Mentality
Fried introduces the concept of a "stayup" rather than a "startup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00">[02:00]</a>. He believes that starting a business is easier than sustaining one, and true success lies in enduring and remaining in business over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24">[02:24]</a>.

> "Starting a business is actually way easier than *in* business now. It none of it's easy so I want to like be supportive of people who are starting businesses but just they should know that that's actually not the hard part." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25">[02:25]</a>

This commitment to longevity means:
*   No long-term plans or growth targets, focusing instead on whether the company is making more money than it spends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>.
*   Playing "infinite games" â€“ building relationships and a company that one wants to keep working at forever, rather than aiming for an exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>.
*   Maintaining independence, which allows the company to transform into anything the founders desire without external influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>.

## The Primacy of Gut and Intuition in Decision-Making

A cornerstone of Fried's approach is the reliance on [[the_role_of_intuition_and_longterm_vision_in_decisionmaking | intuition]] and gut feeling over strict data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>.

> "I will just admit that that's the only way I've ever known how to work. I I don't I don't know how to make decisions by numbers, or I don't find any joy in it frankly. I've always been intuition driven and gut driven and frankly to be honest I think everyone actually is." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:15">[01:44:15]</a>

He believes that every decision is a judgment call, influenced by thousands of known and unknown factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>. While data can be an input, it is never the sole determinant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:56">[01:45:56]</a>. Executives are hired for their judgment and experience, which are amorphous qualities derived from accumulated experiences, not just the ability to read spreadsheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

This philosophy extends to internal communication and product development:
*   **Focus on "Feel":** Instead of asking "what do you know" or "how certain are you," Fried encourages his team to ask "what do you think" or "how does this feel?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:35">[01:47:35]</a>. This acknowledges that humans are primarily "feeling creatures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>.
*   **Hiring for Taste and Instinct:** When hiring designers, Fried looks for their taste, what products they admire, and their ability to riff on ideas spontaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:08">[01:51:08]</a>. He seeks individuals whose gut is "filled with ideas" and who are willing to lean into them without fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:41">[01:52:41]</a>. This promotes a culture of [[thinking_creatively_in_business | creative exploration]] and "play" in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>.

## Operationalizing Intuitive Decisions

### Shape Up Methodology
37signals utilizes a unique [[decision_making_in_product_management | product development]] framework called "Shape Up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36">[03:36]</a>. Its core principles include:
*   **Six-Week Cycles:** Projects are capped at a maximum of six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54">[03:54]</a>. This is an "appetite" (a fixed budget of time), not an "estimate" (which tend to expand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41">[03:41]</a>. This forces teams to find the simplest, most effective version of a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33">[03:33]</a>.
*   **Two-Person Teams:** Every feature is developed by a maximum of two people: one programmer and one designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55">[03:55]</a>. This avoids the complexity and slow decision-making of larger teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>.
*   **No Long-Term Planning:** [[importance_of_strategy_and_decision_making_in_product_management | Business planning]] beyond short cycles is viewed as a fantasy, as future obligations can lead to unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01">[03:01]</a>. The company operates in the "now," making it up as they go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31">[03:31]</a>.
*   **Cool-Down Periods:** After each six-week cycle, there's a two-week cool-down period where employees can internally freelance, fix bugs, or work on pet projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29">[04:29]</a>. This replenishes energy and prevents burnout from continuous "sprints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47">[04:47]</a>.

### Avoiding Promises and External Expectations
Fried advises against making promises about delivery dates, as they often lead to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48">[03:48]</a>. The further out a promise is, the easier it is to make and the more likely it is to set oneself up for failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22">[03:22]</a>. This ties into the broader philosophy of managing expectations, both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>.

## The Role of Constraints and Risk

Fried believes that constraints, such as small teams and limited cash, lead to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45">[01:45]</a>. Having too much money can lead to "sloppiness" because there's no pressure to be efficient or profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. Bootstrapping, by contrast, forces entrepreneurs to continually practice making money, a fundamental skill for successful business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

> "The value in bootstrapping is that it teaches entrepreneurs, it not even teaches it forces them to have to figure out how to make money and the more time under the curve they have making money practicing making money the better at it they're going to get." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>

### Negative Visualization
To manage risk and fear, Fried practices "negative visualization," a stoic concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a>. This involves being at peace with the worst possible outcome, allowing one to move forward without excessive worry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. For example, when launching a new product like their "Once" line, they acknowledge it might not work and are comfortable with that potential outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>.

### Work Isn't War
Fried criticizes the pervasive use of war metaphors in business (e.g., "target customers," "conquer the market," "destroy the competition") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. He finds this language depressing and prefers words that evoke creativity, pride, and excitement, such as "let's make something great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. This shift in language shapes a healthier mindset and environment for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>. This falls under the broader field of [[psychology_in_marketing_and_decisionmaking | psychology in business]].

## Conclusion

Jason Fried's approach to business and [[examples_and_advice_on_decisionmaking_frameworks_for_managers_and_leaders | decision-making]] champions a path of independence, profitability, and intuitive action. By embracing constraints, fostering a culture of trust and "feeling," and releasing the need for rigid long-term plans or massive scale, businesses can create sustainable, fulfilling endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>. His core advice remains: "no one ever went broke making a profit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

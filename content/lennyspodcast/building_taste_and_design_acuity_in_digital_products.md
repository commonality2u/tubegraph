Developing "taste" in digital product design is not an innate talent, but rather a skill that can be cultivated and improved over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Cultivating Taste through Exposure

A critical step in developing taste is to expose oneself to a wide variety of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. At Vercel, an internal operating principle is "increasing exposure hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>. This means actively trying many products and watching how people use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.

Key practices for increasing exposure:
*   **Try lots of products** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.
*   **Ship frequently and seek feedback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>: Be honest with yourself, build something, get it out there, observe user reactions, and be prepared to iterate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:23">[01:08:23]</a>. This feedback loop is crucial for refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.
*   **Observe how others use products**: Quantify time spent watching people interact with your products or others' products to build this "muscle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>.
*   **Use the best apps**: This is a practical way to increase exposure hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:45">[01:09:45]</a>.
*   **Gain experience from customer success**: Observe the success of your customers in the real world as a form of exposure hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.
*   **Invite live demos**: Encourage customers to demonstrate how they use your product, as this often uncovers pain points or non-intuitive aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Design and Taste

AI tools like V0 can significantly aid in [[Creativity and Innovation in Product Design | creativity and innovation]] and the development of good taste in product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. V0 is described as being "the most beautiful by default builder out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:45">[01:43:45]</a>.

*   **Infusion of Best Practices**: V0 tries to embed the best practices of the web into its outputs, often producing more accessible code than a human engineer might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31">[02:22:31]</a>. It leverages the global component systems used by leading tools like Grock.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Style Application**: The tool can intelligently apply specific styles, even from abstract concepts like a clothing company's aesthetic, or from existing websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>.
*   **Responsive Design**: V0 automatically handles responsiveness, generating features like a hamburger menu for mobile views without explicit prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.
*   **Prompting for Aesthetics**: Users can prompt V0 with abstract aesthetic terms like "make it more jazzy," "make it pop," or specific styles like "neo brutalist," "minimalist," or "vintage" to guide its design output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>.

## Impact on Product Roles

The rise of AI tools suggests a future where product professionals can be "more full stack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

*   **Designers**: A designer can ship a fully developed product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Product Managers**: A product manager can prototype and ship directly to production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Product management teams at Vercel are already using V0 to create live, interactive PRDs (Product Requirement Documents), including error states and slow stream states, which are so detailed they are almost ready to ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This empowers product builders to explore and augment their thinking, considering more product states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Engineers**: Backend engineers, who historically might not have had frontend skills, can now bring their end-to-end vision to life using tools like V0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.

This shift removes traditional limitations on what individuals can build and ship, allowing for more ambitious dreams in web services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It changes the interaction between product builders and customers, mediating it through shareable "artifacts" (like V0 links) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>.

### The Importance of Core Conceptual Understanding

While AI tools handle much of the "translation" work in programming (e.g., converting design sketches into CSS), understanding the underlying conceptual systems remains crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. Knowing terms like "CSS," "layout," and "styles" allows users to influence the AI model and make it follow their intentions more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:51">[02:32:51]</a>. This involves less in-depth memorization of specific properties but more a grasp of fundamental logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:05">[02:35:05]</a>.

Similarly, developing "eloquence" and a rich linguistic ability, knowing the right "tokens" or words to describe desired effects, is vital for guiding AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:50">[02:48:50]</a>. For example, using a word like "turbulence" to describe an animation effect can yield impressive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to make it possible for everyone to "cook" and get their ideas out there, fostering a future where if you can dream it, you can ship it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-26:00>[01:26:00]</a>.

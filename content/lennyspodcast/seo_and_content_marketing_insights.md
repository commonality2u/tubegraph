Melton Coran Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, emphasizes fundamental principles for successful online growth, particularly focusing on [[Identifying growth opportunities via SEO | SEO and content marketing]]. These strategies are crucial for establishing an initial online presence and scaling efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Foundational Steps for Online Presence

Before investing heavily in paid channels, a business should establish a solid online foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:

*   **Website Basics**: Ensure you have a website that is fast and recognized by search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A slow website (loading in four-plus seconds) can hinder even successful paid ad programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Discoverability**: The next step is ensuring people can find your website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This often involves writing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Clear Messaging**: Your website's copy should clearly explain what your business does, avoiding generic statements that could apply to many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. Prioritize explaining the problem you solve, the solution, and tangible benefits like time or cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

## Effective SEO Strategies

For [[SEO strategies for successful companies | successful SEO]], the focus should be on providing value and answering user questions effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

### Focus on User Intent
A common mistake is simply "shoving keywords" into content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Instead, understand why someone is searching a particular keyword and what they are trying to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. If people are not asking a question to Google, writing content for that topic will not lead to discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### The "Google Search Over" Metric
A key principle for high-quality content is to ask: "Is the Google search over?" after someone reads your content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Search engines prioritize giving users the quickest answer, so content that ends the search is valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Utilize the "People also ask" section at the bottom of Google search results to identify subsequent questions users might have, ensuring your content addresses a comprehensive range of needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

### Keyword Research and Prioritization (Traffic Light System)
Deel uses a "Traffic Light System" framework for keyword research and prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>:
1.  **Identify Keywords**: Compile up to 700 keywords related to your business, ranging from closely to distantly related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
2.  **Rank by Volume**: Organize keywords from highest to lowest search volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
3.  **Assess Intent**: Determine the intent behind each keyword search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>:
    *   **Green Light**: High intent; the person is likely looking for your solution and will become a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
    *   **Yellow Light**: Moderate intent; 50/50 chance they are looking to buy soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
    *   **Red Light**: Low intent; the person is not looking to buy your solution (e.g., a student doing research) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
4.  **Prioritize Content Creation**: Start with green light keywords (highest to lowest volume), then yellow, often never reaching the red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Content Quality and Readability
Content should be written in simple language, aiming for a fifth-grade reading level to ensure broad understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. Tools like Clearscope can help ensure the content is well-written and optimized for relevant keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

### Continuous Content Updates
Regulations and information change constantly, especially in fields like payroll and HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. Therefore, content needs to be continuously fact-checked and updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. Deel updates approximately five articles and publishes five new ones per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>, across multiple languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

### When to Invest in SEO
Not every company should heavily invest in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. It's most effective for B2B products solving active problems where people actively search for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. Direct-to-consumer companies selling products like lipstick might find less value in SEO, as consumers often use social media or influencers for discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. Even if they search for "best lipstick," an objective third-party comparison site is more likely to rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.

## The Content Team at Deel

Deel's content team, led by a director, is structured to be more operational than creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   One person manages all operations, including working with freelancers, sending briefs, fact-checking, and publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   Specialists focus on different product lines to ensure deep expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.
*   Recently, a team was created to explore new content mediums beyond written articles, such as video and educational content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.
*   The full-time content team consists of about eight people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. This team contributes to approximately 50% of Deel's current growth, though the net number of people reached has grown significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## SEO as a "Cheap" Growth Channel

SEO and content marketing are considered "cheap" growth channels because they involve adding value by answering people's questions, rather than direct advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This means solving problems rather than just selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

*   **Discipline Required**: While not "rocket science," successful SEO requires significant time and discipline. Cutting corners often leads to low-quality resources that nobody wants to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Quality over Automation**: Although some tasks can be automated, SEO never stops being time-consuming to do well. Avoid the temptation to automate everything, as it often sacrifices quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

For Deel, early growth was heavily driven by non-paid channels like partnerships and [[identifying_growth_opportunities_via_seo | SEO]], contributing 80-90% of growth initially, and still around 50% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

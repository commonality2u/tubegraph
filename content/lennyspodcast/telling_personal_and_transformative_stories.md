[[The importance of storytelling in business | Storytelling]] is a significant buzzword in business, with many professionals aspiring to be storytellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, truly being a storyteller requires separating oneself from the "herd," a risk many are hesitant to take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The alternative, remaining in the herd, leads to being forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Humans are not wired to remember facts, statistics, or platitudes unless they are attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Without stories, information is easily forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Matthew Dicks, author of "Storyworthy," a highly recommended book on [[developing storytelling skills | storytelling]], is a 59-time Moth Story Slam winner and nine-time Grand Slam champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He teaches individuals and teams at companies like Slack, Amazon, Lego, and Salesforce the skill of [[developing storytelling skills | storytelling]] and public speaking through his company, Speak Up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. His approach is tactical, focusing on how to tell better stories in life and work, find story ideas, and master public speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## The Core of a Good Story: The 5-Second Moment

Every good story is centered around one "5-second moment" of transformation or realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This moment can be as brief as one second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Transformation**: The storyteller was one kind of person and is now a new kind of person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Realization**: The storyteller used to think one thing, and now, after some events, thinks a new thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

These changes, while seeming to happen over time, culminate in a singular "flip" moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The primary purpose of a story is to bring this moment to maximum clarity for the audience, allowing them to experience the transformation or realization alongside the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The rest of the story (about 98%) serves as context to bring that singular moment to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Example: Eileen's Confidence
As an elementary school teacher, Matthew shared a story about a student, Eileen, who struggled with anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. After working to build her confidence, Matthew hesitated to call her to the board for math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. When he later asked her about it, her cheeky response, "I don't like that cheeky smile of yours," was his 5-second moment of realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. He understood that Eileen trusted him and felt confident enough to be herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This brief moment, he explains, could be expanded into a five or six-minute story about their journey, including his failures and steps to help her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Starting at the End
Knowing the singular moment of transformation or realization also tells the storyteller how the story will end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. For true stories, storytellers should start at the end, as the ending informs everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. A story is essentially about two opposing moments in time: a beginning and an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. For example, in a romantic comedy, if two people are not in love at the beginning, you know they will be by the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This doesn't ruin the story; the journey is what makes it entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Starting at the end ensures the story has something important to say, rather than merely recounting chronological events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

> "Our minds are wired to enjoy story over and over and over again." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>

Change is critical because it has universal appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. While the specific content (e.g., teaching math) might not be universally relatable, the underlying change (e.g., finding confidence) is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Focusing on change exponentially increases the story's universal appeal and the ability to connect with an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## Matthew Dicks' Checklist for a Good Story

1.  **There is a Change**: As discussed above, a story must involve a moment of transformation or realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
2.  **The "Dinner Test"**: A formal story should be closely related to what you would tell someone at dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Avoid "performance art" elements like unattributed dialogue or starting with a sound effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. The story should feel natural, like a slightly elevated version of a dinner conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
3.  **It Must Be *Your* Story**: Telling a story about someone else is akin to telling fiction if that person isn't present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. True [[empathydriven_storytelling | storytelling]] requires vulnerability, revealing something about yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. If you tell a story about others, center it on yourself by explaining how their experience informed or changed *your* life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

> "Unless something happened on that vacation where you experienced one of these 5-second fundamental moments of change, nobody cares about your vacation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>

When telling vacation stories, only talk about the moment of change; the location is often irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. The shortest version of every story is the best, starting as close to the end as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

## The Importance of Stakes

Stakes are what the audience should be worried about, wanting for you, or wondering about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. If the audience isn't wondering what happens next, they've stopped listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

### Ways to Insert Stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>
*   **Elephant**: Plant a big thing at the beginning that immediately causes the audience to wonder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. (e.g., a big spaceship shooting a small spaceship, a police officer chasing a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>).
*   **Backpack**: Tell the audience your plan before you carry it out, so they internalize your hopes and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.
*   **Breadcrumbs**: Offer small hints of what's going on without revealing the complete idea, like a gun in the room that you know will eventually go off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   **Hourglass**: When the audience is on the edge of their seat, slow time down and load the story with details, prolonging the arrival of the next sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Crystal Ball**: Predict a future (not necessarily accurate) to make the audience worried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. (e.g., predicting a student crying in front of the class).

Stakes should build throughout the story, not just be front-loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. Most stakes should occur in the first half, with the second half being the "roller coaster to the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

### Surprise
Surprise is a delightful moment where the audience didn't see something coming, but once it happens, it feels inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. Every story has at least one surprise, as a realization is often a surprise for the storyteller, and it can be for the audience too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. To achieve this, enough information must be placed earlier in the story so the surprise is inevitable, yet cleverly hidden so it's not seen coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

## Storytelling in Business

If you don't tell stories in business, you risk being forgettable and mediocre, just like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>. People often remember the story over factual presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.

### Benefits of Storytelling in Business
*   **Memorability**: Stories make you stand out and be remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.
*   **Connection**: Personal stories reveal you as a human being, fostering connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.
*   **Engagement**: Stories capture and hold attention far better than facts or data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

### Examples of [[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_business | Storytelling in Business]]
*   **Boris, the Factory Owner**: Boris used a personal story about his son striking out in a Little League championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. His son quickly moved past the failure, unlike Boris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. Boris used this to teach his sales team to move on quickly from failed accounts, rather than sulking for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. This approach was more effective than direct criticism, revealing Boris's humanity as a father and providing a tangible vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
*   **Masha, Slack's Communications Director**: Masha needed to create a narrative for Slack to compete against Microsoft Teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. She developed a brilliant narrative but initially hesitated to include a personal anecdote about feeling lonely during the pandemic when the idea struck her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. When she later included a 30-second personal anecdote, it dramatically increased audience connection, making her seem like a human being rather than a "corporate monolith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

### Making it Personal
To foster connection, find ways to subtly make your story personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Matthew uses a "personal interest inventory" tool to identify aspects of one's life that can create connections, weighing "addressable market" (how many people relate) against "intensity of connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
*   **Marriage**: A large addressable market, moderate connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
*   **Marathoners**: Small addressable market, enormous intensity of connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.
*   **Elementary School Teacher**: High positive perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
When asked "how are you doing," instead of a generic answer, weave in a personal detail, demonstrating humor or self-deprecation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

### How to Keep People Listening in Business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>
1.  **Stakes**: Incorporate all types of stakes (elephant, backpack, breadcrumbs, hourglass, crystal ball) into presentations and pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>.
2.  **Surprise**: Design talks with moments of unexpected yet inevitable revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
3.  **Suspense**: Keep the audience wondering what will happen next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.
4.  **Humor**: Dare to be funny, despite the risk of a joke not landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. Humor differentiates you and makes you memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.

#### Humor Strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>
*   **Nostalgia**: Leverage shared experiences from the past, especially when introducing new products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. The facts of the past can be inherently funny without trying too hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>. This also demonstrates expertise in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>.
*   **"One of these things is not like the other"**: Present three things, two expected and one unexpected, with the unexpected one providing humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.

### Non-Obvious Applications of [[storytelling_as_a_critical_skill_for_product_managers | Storytelling]]
A scientist selling laboratory tubes (a product with competitors selling similar, cheaper tubes that required "retrofitting") used a story about his family's diverse apple preferences at the grocery store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. He then connected this to his company's offering: providing a variety of perfectly sized tubes, like having access to all desired apples, rather than just one type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. This story, without data, generated more leads than all other scientists combined, as it created a relatable connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. Every time attendees saw apples, they would think of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>.

This demonstrates "speaking with adjacency": matching a story's theme, meaning, or message, rather than its content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>. The "snap" moment when the audience realizes the connection between seemingly unrelated content (e.g., apples and tubes) is powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

## [[Developing storytelling skills | Developing Storytelling Skills]]: Homework for Life

"Homework for Life" is a daily practice where you look back on your day before bed and identify one moment worth telling as a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. Record this moment in an Excel spreadsheet or similar tool, with the date in one column and a brief description in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.

### Benefits of Homework for Life
*   **Endless Stories**: You'll discover your life is filled with more stories than you'll ever have time to tell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. Matthew's own rate increased from 1.8 moments per day to 7.6 moments per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.
*   **Develops a Storytelling Lens**: You learn to recognize and hold onto moments you might have forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.
*   **Recovers Time**: Instead of time flying by unaccounted for, you actively hold onto your days, slowing down the perception of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
*   **Reveals Patterns**: You start to see recurring themes or behaviors in your life you might not have noticed otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
*   **Recovers Past Memories**: The practice helps old memories bubble up, which can also be recorded as "Memory" moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.
*   **Therapeutic Element**: It provides a self-centered (in a positive way) opportunity for reflection and self-discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>.

Start today: "Every day that you don't do homework for life is a day that is going to be lost to you forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## [[Crafting compelling presentations | Overcoming Public Speaking Nerves]]

Public speaking is often cited as a top fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>.
*   **Understand the Source of Nerves**: 98% of nervousness occurs *before* you begin speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Once you start, most nerves fall away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. Accepting this can be a relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>.
*   **Everyone Gets Nervous**: You are not alone; even famous or experienced speakers feel nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.
*   **Preparation is Key**:
    *   **Record and Listen Passively**: Record your talk and listen to it repeatedly while doing other tasks (e.g., grocery shopping, chores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. This allows the content to "seep into your soul" and become part of you, making recall easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
    *   **Active Listening for Transitions**: While listening, actively focus on transitions between sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>. Most people forget transitions, not the main content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Practice moving smoothly from one scene or idea to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.
    *   **Avoid Memorizing**: Memorizing your talk can lead to "tortured souls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:12">[01:32:12]</a>; aim to remember the talk without word-for-word memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>.

## The Power of Saying Yes

Saying "yes" to opportunities, even those that seem crazy or undesirable, can lead to extraordinary outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>. Rejecting opportunities because you "know" what's on the other side of the door, without stepping through it, is presumptuous and arrogant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a>.

> "A 'yes' can always become a 'no'." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>

You can always step through the door, try something, and if it's not for you, step back out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>. Many people say "no" out of fear, but the things that frighten you are often the best things for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>. Saying "yes" can create extraordinary causal chains, leading to unexpected meetings and new doors opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:32">[01:29:32]</a>. For example, Matthew himself took up stand-up comedy because a friend challenged him, and he was terrified, leading him to relentlessly pursue it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:58">[01:29:58]</a>.

## Tactical Tip for Starting a Story

To immediately engage your audience, start every story with two elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:17">[01:38:17]</a>:
1.  **Location**: "Location activates imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:24">[01:38:24]</a>. It allows the audience to visualize the setting and implicitly applies thousands of adjectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:26">[01:38:26]</a>.
2.  **Action**: Something needs to be happening right away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. This indicates that the story is moving forward and immediately grabs attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.

This simple opening signals to the audience that a story is beginning, encouraging them to quiet down and listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>. It's like signaling that "the movie's on," which naturally commands attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:34">[01:40:34]</a>.

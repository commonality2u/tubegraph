Vykraman, the Head of Product at Gojek, known for building strong product talent and being a top product leader in Asia, shared insights on what makes product managers successful and how to foster [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## The Three Ws Career Growth Framework

Vykraman developed a [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | career growth framework]] for product managers, based on observations of strong product managers and discussions with other product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This framework, known as the "Three Ws," focuses on three key areas:
1.  What you produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
2.  What you bring to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
3.  What's your operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>

Truly strong product managers, especially those experiencing rapid [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | career growth]], perform well across all three axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### 1. What You Produce: Outputs and Outcomes

Early in a product manager's career, the focus should be on outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Outputs include tangible deliverables like launching a product, analyzing and running experiments, or contributing to a go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The key is to simply "get stuff out and done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

As one gains comfort with outputs and working with stakeholders, the focus shifts to outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Outcomes involve owning product areas, setting goals, and collaborating on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Beyond outcomes, the next stage is leadership and directional areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

A common [[challenges_and_pitfalls_in_product_management | mistake]] is for product managers to stop honing their craft on outputs when transitioning to outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Even at senior levels, it's crucial to maintain "IC roots" (Individual Contributor) by being willing to "pull up your sleeves and go back and keep working" on outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

Being useful to the team, manager, and company by getting things done, shipping products on time, and being helpful is key to demonstrating good output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This means volunteering for tasks like preparing briefs, slides for leadership reviews, or legal reviews, and delivering first drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

### 2. What You Bring to the Table: Impact on Impact

This aspect refers to a product manager's "impact on impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. It's not enough for a product area to be successful; the product manager must demonstrate their significant contribution to that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

Key indicators of bringing value to the table include:
*   High-quality Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>
*   Well-crafted product notes for care and marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>
*   Ability to derive from strategy rather than constantly pushing back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>
*   Proficiency in drafting north stars, running experiments, working with data, and metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>
*   Producing coherent product artifacts like strategy documents and design briefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>

These artifacts are critical for demonstrating competency in four core pillars:
*   Data and metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>
*   Design and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>
*   Technology skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>
*   Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>

Instead of bringing arguments or pushbacks to the table, effective product managers can channelize questions, inputs, and directions into strategic choices that shape discussions and overall direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

### 3. What's Your Operating Model: How You Work With Others

This is considered the most crucial aspect for growth, especially from mid-senior to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. It encompasses:
*   Communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>
*   Collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>
*   Organizational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>
*   Community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>

Three tenets define working well with other stakeholders:
1.  **Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>
2.  **Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>
3.  **Be in charge of getting decisions made, and not making all the decisions yourself.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>

The "art of pushback" is vital. Instead of being seen as an obstacle, product managers should be seen as someone who adds value and advances the product's direction and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. This often involves bringing conversations from an emotional space to a more logical, equal footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

## Impediments to Career Growth

[[challenges_and_pitfalls_in_product_management | Product managers often shoot themselves in the foot]] by exhibiting certain mindsets or behaviors that hinder their [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Three key mindset shifts are critical for faster growth:
1.  **Focusing on what you control vs. what you cannot control.** As product managers become mid-senior, conversations can shift from personal learning and growth to external factors (e.g., "why is the organization not doing this?" or "why do I not get to work on projects like this?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. It's vital to maintain focus on controllable aspects within the Three Ws framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
2.  **Your relationship with change.** Early in a career, the rate of personal skill change is high, leading to rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. At mid-senior levels, the rate of change can slow down as individuals become hesitant to take on new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. To counter this, continuously seek ways to increase the "rate of change" by benchmarking skills against industry bests or professionals in other functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.
3.  **How you see yourself.** Self-perceptions or "stories you tell yourself" can define and limit behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. For example, labeling oneself as a "high agency PM" might excuse brashness, or being "hyper collaborative" might excuse indecisiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. Correcting these self-stories, ideally with trusted feedback, is crucial for [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. A useful self-story is that of a "learner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

## [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | Becoming a Successful Product Manager]]

### Cultivating Core Skills

Product managers are often evaluated on eight core axes or skills:
*   Data and metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>
*   Design and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>
*   Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>
*   Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>
*   Communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>
*   Collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>
*   Organizational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>
*   Community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>

When trying to improve, product managers should:
*   **Be open to feedback**: Treat feedback as a gift, even if it's difficult to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Pick a focus area**: Don't try to improve on every area simultaneously, as this can be overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>. Identify the area that offers "maximum leverage" for your growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. If significantly negative in an area, fix that first for the highest leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.
*   **Prioritize skill development**: For those starting their careers or [[key_skills_and_career_paths_for_transitioning_from_product_owner_to_product_manager | transitioning into product management]], it's recommended to pick one skill from data or tech, and one from design or research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. These provide maximum leverage because they are skills often less developed in prior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. Once proficient in two of these, then focus on strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.
*   **Understand the ambiguity of the role**: The product manager role is ambiguous and varies across companies and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. If something is blocking product progress, a product manager should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. The PM is the "co-collaborator for all of these disciplines" (data, design, tech, strategy), connecting all parts of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **Be the community enabler**: Especially in remote or distributed teams, the product manager acts as the "community enabler" within the team and organization, tying everyone together towards a common mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

### Definitions of Key Skills

*   **Data**: From defining basic metrics and understanding impact on orders/users/revenue (level zero) to mastering data analysis and potentially building a data startup (level five) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>.
*   **Design & Research**: At level zero, identifying user problems; at level five, defining user problems and tying them to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
*   **Technology**: From lacking basic understanding of HTTP/API (level zero) to engaging in deep debates and writing technology design documents (level five) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Not about corporate or business strategy, but "how are you going to climb that mountain" once the goal is defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>. It includes defining user segments, their needs, identifying the right product, and the order of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.

## Contrarian Beliefs

Vykraman holds a few beliefs that may be considered "contrarian":
*   **Intent is not enough**: While good intent is important, actions, behavior, and the way one communicates and collaborates also need to clearly convey who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.
*   **Effort and hours are necessary**: Putting in significant effort and hours is crucial for personal growth and skill improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. This isn't just about company growth, but individual development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>.

He emphasizes that it's "never too late" to pursue what you want to do or be in your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

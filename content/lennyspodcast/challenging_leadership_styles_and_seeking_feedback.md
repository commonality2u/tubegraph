[[Candor and feedback in professional growth | Radical Candor]] is a framework for professional communication that combines "caring personally" with "challenging directly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This approach is best understood by contrasting it with common communication failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>:

*   **Obnoxious Aggression:** Occurs when an individual remembers to challenge directly but forgets to show that they care personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. This approach can be inefficient as it puts others in a "fight or flight" mode, making them unable to hear what is being said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. It's often fueled by extreme frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
*   **Ruinous Empathy:** This is the most common problem, occurring when people remember to show they care personally but fail to tell others something they need to know for fear of hurting feelings or offending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. Approximately 90% of mistakes fall into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. It creates a "false harmony" that can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Manipulative Insincerity:** The worst quadrant, where neither personal care nor direct challenge is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. This can be a self-protective behavior, pretending to agree when disagreeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

The goal of [[Candor and feedback in professional growth | Radical Candor]] is to build better relationships and achieve better work results, leading to greater success and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

## Impact of Not Practicing Candor

Failing to provide candid feedback, particularly due to [[Ruinous empathy | ruinous empathy]] or manipulative insincerity, can have severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>:

*   **Loss of Top Performers:** When poor performance is tolerated without feedback, high-performing team members may become frustrated and seek opportunities elsewhere where their best work is valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27:00">[24:27:00]</a>.
*   **Inefficiency:** Tolerating poor work affects team deliverables and requires others to redo work, hurting overall results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>.
*   **Unfairness to the Individual:** Not providing direct feedback means the individual doesn't get the opportunity to improve, which can lead to termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Seeking Feedback

Seeking criticism is the first and most important step to improving relationships and making it easier to both give and receive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>.

### Asking the Right Question

Avoid general questions like, "Do you have any feedback for me?" as they often elicit a "no, everything's fine" response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead, questions should be authentic to you and designed to elicit a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>:

*   "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
*   "Tell me why I'm wrong." (While effective for some, it may be too aggressive for others and require adjustment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>
*   "What's one thing I could be doing better?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:00">[41:01:00]</a>
*   "What's one way I could be helping you be more successful?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:05:00">[41:05:00]</a>
*   "What could I have done this week to better support you in your work?" (Time-bounded) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:21:00">[41:21:00]</a>

### Who to Ask and How Often

*   **Direct Reports:** As a manager, solicit feedback from each direct report weekly, budgeting five minutes at the end of every one-on-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-Functional Peers and Boss:** Ask your go-to question of those you work most closely with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:13:00">[40:13:00]</a>.
*   **Vary the Question:** Don't ask the exact same question every time, as it can sound inauthentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:21:00">[40:21:00]</a>.

### Handling the Response

1.  **Embrace Discomfort and Silence:** The other person will likely feel uncomfortable, so be prepared for silence. Count to six to give them space to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:32:00">[43:32:00]</a>.
2.  **Listen to Understand, Not Respond:** It's natural to feel defensive when receiving critical feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:27:00">[44:27:00]</a>. Manage this by asking follow-up questions to ensure you truly understand what they are saying, rather than jumping to conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:16:00">[45:16:00]</a>.
3.  **Reward the Candor:** This is the most crucial step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:44:00">[45:44:00]</a>.
    *   **If you agree:** Fix the problem and make your listening tangible. Be loud about the change, demonstrating that their feedback led to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:58:00">[45:58:00]</a>. Ask for follow-up feedback to ensure you've corrected appropriately, even overcorrecting if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:25:00">[46:25:00]</a>.
    *   **If you disagree:** Acknowledge the part of the feedback you can agree with. State, "As for the rest of it, I want to think about it and get back to you," and then follow through with a respectful explanation of your disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:56:00">[46:56:00]</a>. Unspoken disagreement, not disagreement itself, poses a risk to relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:37:00">[47:37:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Giving Feedback (HIP Core)

[[Methods for providing constructive feedback | Feedback]] should be humble, helpful, immediate, given in person or synchronously, praise in public and criticize in private, and not about personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>.

### The CORE Framework

Structure your feedback using "Context, Observation, Result, Next Step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>:

*   **Context:** Where and when the behavior occurred (e.g., "In the meeting..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>).
*   **Observation:** The specific behavior observed (e.g., "...when you said 'um' every third word..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>).
*   **Result:** The impact of the behavior (e.g., "...it made you sound stupid." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>). This can be softened with humility (e.g., "It seems like you're not happy with this," or "Maybe I'm misinterpreting..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>).
*   **Next Step:** The desired change or action (e.g., "Go to the speech coach." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>).

[[Methods for providing constructive feedback | Feedback]] should be given immediately, unless you or the other person are too upset to receive it constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. Doing it immediately saves time in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:10:00">[51:10:00]</a>.

### Managing Emotional Responses

When giving feedback, monitor the other person's emotional response. If they appear sad or mad, adjust by moving up on the "care personally" dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:05:00">[55:05:00]</a>. For sadness, try: "I feel like maybe I didn't say that in the best possible way. How could I have said it differently?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:57:00">[55:57:00]</a>. For anger, "Look, maybe I didn't say that in the right way, but this is an important issue and we need to resolve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:06:00">[57:06:00]</a>. The key is to get curious, not furious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:02:00">[57:02:00]</a>.

## Addressing Cultural Challenges and Leadership Styles

Transforming a company culture towards [[Candor and feedback in professional growth | Radical Candor]] can be challenging, especially if the current culture leans towards [[Ruinous empathy | ruinous empathy]] or [[Obnoxious aggression | obnoxious aggression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>.

### Overcoming People-Pleaser Tendencies

For those who tend to be people-pleasers, it's helpful to realize that your job isn't to be liked, but to genuinely care about others and be "others-focused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>. It's often unkind in the long run *not* to provide honest feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

### [[Coaching strategies for CEOs and leaders | Coaching Leaders]] with Low Self-Awareness

For [[Leadership and personal growth as a CEO | leaders]] who display [[Obnoxious aggression | obnoxious aggression]] or ignore problems, help them understand the impact they are having <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:06:00">[58:06:00]</a>. Explain that their style is inefficient and that showing care can lead to better results, aligning with their "enlightened self-interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:38:00">[58:38:00]</a>. Sharing personal stories of past mistakes can help them reflect on their own behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

### Differentiating Effective Directness from Obnoxious Aggression

Not all direct leaders are obnoxious. True [[Leadership and personal growth as a CEO | leaders]] like Steve Jobs, despite being direct, often built deep relationships rooted in genuine care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The perception of directness depends on the listener's ear and the context of the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. There is a false dichotomy that one must choose between being a "total jerk but competent" or "nice but incompetent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>. [[Coaching strategies for CEOs and leaders | Radical Candor]] offers a third, more effective way that doesn't hurt people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.

## Cultivating Authentic [[Leadership and personal growth as a CEO | Leadership]]

Authentic [[Leadership and personal growth as a CEO | leadership]] requires aligning your communication style with your genuine self while still considering its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>. The core of this is recognizing that genuine kindness involves delivering difficult truths when necessary, as it is unkind in the long run not to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>. Focusing on doing the right thing for people and truly caring about their future helps overcome personal discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.

## Practical Next Steps

To immediately begin building the muscle of [[Candor and feedback in professional growth | Radical Candor]], write down your personal "go-to question" for soliciting feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. Practice it in front of a mirror, then with a friend, and refine it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>. Then, put five minutes in your calendar to ask that question of someone you work with, either in a dedicated meeting or at the end of an existing one-on-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>. Remember, you don't have to choose between being successful and being a jerk; you can be a successful, kind person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.

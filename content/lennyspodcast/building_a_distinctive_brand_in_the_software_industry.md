Ros Herberg, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) and VP of Product Strategy at Whiz, provides insights into [[building_and_maintaining_brand_identity | building a distinctive brand]], drawing from her unconventional career path from engineer to product manager and now to marketing leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Whiz, a cloud security company, is notable for being the fastest-growing software company in history, reaching $100 million ARR in just 18 months after its founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## From Product-Market Fit to Brand Building

Initially, Whiz's founders didn't have a clear product idea and even after landing on one, it proved ineffective, leading to a pivot six weeks after Herberg joined as the first product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The team conducted numerous meetings, speaking with 10-15 potential customers daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Early conversations often ended with polite "sounds interesting" remarks, which felt good but lacked genuine commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Herberg, confused about what they were truly building, eventually asked for clarity, prompting a deep discussion and a pivot to cloud security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

The key signal for [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | product-market fit]] was a shift in customer questions, from general interest to concrete inquiries like "how are you pricing this?" or "when can we start doing a PO?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This indicated true enthusiasm and a desire to take the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. Whiz also learned that it was crucial for founders to drive early sales themselves, gaining firsthand experience and confidence before hiring a sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

## The Evolution to Marketing Leadership

Approximately two and a half years into Whiz's journey, with a clear product-market fit and a functioning sales team, the challenge shifted to marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Despite winning proofs of value (POVs) against competitors, Whiz often encountered customers who wished they had heard of the company earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Recognizing the growing importance of brand awareness as a company scales, Herberg was asked to lead marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

Herberg, having spent her career in engineering and product, initially found the idea of leading marketing bizarre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. She wasn't familiar with marketing terminology like "lead" or "pipeline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. However, her decision to take on the role was driven by her philosophy of following good people and a belief that brand becomes critical for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

> "At some point of every product, people start looking really heavily at brand whether we think that way or we don't. When I buy my iPhone, I have no idea how it really is compared to an Android phone. I did not look at the specs. I truly have no idea. So why do I like why do I buy an iPhone? I just know it's like the thing to buy. B2B products, even the most complex products, people are still people; they still buy it because brand matters a lot." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>

## Strategies for Building a Distinctive Brand

### Following the "Heat" in the Organization

Herberg describes how the "heat" or primary focus of a company shifts as it grows:
*   **Early Days:** Product definition and finding fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Next Phase:** Engineering and building the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Scaling:** Sales, then marketing to drive pipeline and awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

Herberg's transition to marketing was a response to where the "heat" was, reflecting the company's need to invest in brand to sustain hyper-growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

### Embracing Experimentation and Risk

Unlike product development where adding features has high costs and is hard to reverse, marketing allows for extensive experimentation with minimal long-term repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

> "Marketing is quite the opposite in my opinion. There's no cost to anything, no maintenance to anything, no technical depth, no anything. Like if tomorrow I post a video on Whiz LinkedIn page and I think that video is super funny and nobody likes that video, nothing happened. Tomorrow I'll post a different video. No maintenance, bye-bye, forgot it ever happened." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>

This philosophy enabled Whiz to take creative risks to "make noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. For example, at RSA, a major security conference, Whiz transformed its booth from a typical "cyber" look to a "Whiz of Oz" theme with actors and bright colors, contrasting sharply with the industry's usual "red and black" aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This unusual approach led to five times more visitors than the previous year and influenced other companies to adopt themed booths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### Cultivating a Unique and Optimistic Brand Identity

Herberg aimed for Whiz's brand to be positive and optimistic, focusing on "magic" rather than fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. This meant adopting bright colors like pink and blue, diverging from conventional cybersecurity branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This distinctive brand strategy helped Whiz stand out and become recognizable.

### Clarity in Messaging: The "Dummy Explanation"

From her marketing vantage point, Herberg realized that product people often live in a "bubble," using complex jargon and acronyms that are not understood by customers or even sales teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

> "If you're on the product side, you can often kind of work with things that are like fluffy or blurry or like gray. Somebody will ask you can the product do this and you'll be like, 'Yeah, not exactly, but like, you know, it can do like blah blah blah.' Like kind of work around something right? Like it doesn't have to be crystal clear because you can kind of go around things in a way that when you try to scale your message, you can't. It gets lost in translation. You have to be crystal clear, black and white. You have to communicate very clearly." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>

This led to the concept of the "dummy explanation" â€“ ensuring all communications are understandable by anyone, without assuming deep technical or market knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. For example, instead of using internal terms like "the Whiz graph database," which refers to a core innovation, simply stating "Whiz graph database" is preferred to avoid assuming customer knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. It's a constant reminder to break free from the internal "bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

### Trust and Vulnerability in Leadership

Herberg emphasizes that the CMO role requires deep trust with the founding team and a strong connection to the product and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This trust was evident when she, as a new product manager, admitted her confusion about the product's direction, leading to the crucial pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This vulnerability and openness, fostered by Whiz's flat organizational culture, allowed for critical self-reflection and ultimately, success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

Herberg's personal approach to leadership involves being "okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail at something and still attempting it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. This mindset, cultivated since childhood, encourages embracing friction and pushing beyond comfort zones, which is vital for [[building a personal brand | personal growth]] and leading bold initiatives in brand building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

Whiz's success in building a distinctive brand highlights the importance of:
*   Deep market and customer understanding.
*   A willingness to experiment and take calculated risks.
*   Prioritizing clear, simple communication.
*   Fostering a culture of trust and openness where challenging assumptions is encouraged.

These principles have allowed Whiz to become a leader in the cloud security space and continue its rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

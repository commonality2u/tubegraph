## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Several mistakes can hinder the success of a [[Understanding ProductLed Sales | Product-Led Sales]] strategy:

*   **Treating [[Understanding ProductLed Sales | Product-Led Sales]] as Traditional Top-Down Sales** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>: A new user sign-up in [[Understanding ProductLed Sales | Product-Led Sales]] is not equivalent to a marketing qualified lead (MQL) in traditional sales. Users are often trying to solve an individual problem, not an enterprise-level one, and are not ready for a sales conversation about budget immediately after signing up. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a> Rushing to engage with a user 10 minutes after sign-up can lead to a negative user experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>
*   **Sending Every User to Sales** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>: This is the quickest way for sales teams to dismiss the product channel as ineffective due to low close rates, as their compensation depends on closing deals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>
*   **Not Understanding the User vs. Buyer Distinction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>: An end-user is fundamentally different from an enterprise buyer. While an end-user might solve an individual problem, an enterprise buyer makes decisions for larger company-wide solutions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>
*   **Failing to Hold Product Accountable for Pipeline** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>: The worst approach is to run [[Understanding ProductLed Sales | Product-Led Sales]] solely through marketing. [[Role of product teams in sales | Product teams]] must take accountability for creating pipeline for sales, especially for [[Critical Data and Tools for ProductLed Sales | Product Qualified Accounts (PQAs)]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a> Many product teams are deeply uncomfortable owning monetization targets, but product leadership should be accountable for revenue goals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>
*   **Neglecting Marketing's Role** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>: The majority of product usage may not include a buyer. Marketing, especially enterprise marketing and account-based marketing, is crucial for finding and attracting the right buyers and connecting them with the existing product usage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>
*   **Not Leveraging Usage for Qualification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>: It's essential to understand the right product usage triggers that indicate a good time for a sales intervention to add value, rather than being disruptive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>
*   **Having Static [[Critical Data and Tools for ProductLed Sales | PQA]] Definitions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>: [[Critical Data and Tools for ProductLed Sales | PQA]] definitions should constantly evolve. Regular feedback cycles with the sales team are necessary to ensure the identified qualification signals remain accurate and effective. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>
*   **Being Too Slow with Data and Efficacy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>: While intuition is a starting point, it's vital to think about scaling data collection and analysis to effectively leverage usage for pipeline creation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>
*   **Lack of Monetization Awareness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>: In freemium products, a significant portion of customers (around 75%) may not be aware of what paid plans offer. Products should effectively communicate the value of paid offerings through features, usage walls, and trials. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a> Ensure that paid functionality is exposed, even to free users, to make them aware of its existence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>

## Key Benchmarks

*   **Self-Serve Monetization Cap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>: Self-serve monetization typically has a ceiling of around $10,000, limited by credit card processing and consumer willingness.
*   **Sales Contract Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>: [[Understanding ProductLed Sales | Product-Led Sales]] allows for much larger contracts, ranging from $15,000 to $100,000 or more. The sales floor for engagement is traditionally around $15,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>
*   **Time to Enterprise Contract** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>: Escalating from individual usage to an enterprise contract does not happen in hours, days, or even a few months. Across companies like Miro, Amplitude, and Netlify, it typically takes **12 months or more** of usage to move from individual problem-solving to a company-level solution. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>
*   **[[Critical Data and Tools for ProductLed Sales | PQA]] "Magic Number"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>: A strong indicator for a [[Critical Data and Tools for ProductLed Sales | Product Qualified Account]] is often **seven or more users** within a company actively using the product. This suggests sufficient value is distributed across multiple people for an enterprise conversation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>
*   **Freemium Conversion Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>: Typically around **5%**.
*   **Trial Conversion Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>: Generally between **10% to 15%**.
*   **Rule of Three in Engagement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>: Similar to advertising, users often need to see paid triggers or monetization information at least **three times** to become aware and remember them, driving conversion awareness.
*   **Onboarding Questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>: Limit onboarding questionnaires to **three to four screens** to avoid deterring users. Focus on essential information like company size, department, seniority, and use case. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>

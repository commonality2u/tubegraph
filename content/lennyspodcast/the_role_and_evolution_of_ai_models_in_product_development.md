The field of AI is characterized by unprecedented speed of change, where the AI models available today are the "worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This rapid evolution, with computers gaining new capabilities every two months, fundamentally changes how product development must be approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Rapid Evolution of AI Models
Unlike traditional technology development where the underlying technology is relatively fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, AI models are in constant flux. OpenAI's general mindset is that a better model will emerge every two months, surpassing current limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Developers are encouraged to build products that are "right on the edge of the capabilities" of current models, knowing that future models will enhance their performance significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

The definition of "AI" itself shifts; what is considered AI today becomes "machine learning" once it works, and then simply an "algorithm" when it becomes ubiquitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. For example, GPT-3, which was "mind-blowing" at its launch, now feels like "slop" compared to current models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This rapid advancement means that AI models are getting smarter, faster, cheaper, and safer (less prone to hallucination) with each iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>. The growth is exponential, with capabilities increasing by 10x every year, far exceeding the pace of Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.

The dynamic nature of AI models means that [[changing_role_of_product_management_with_ai|product management in the AI era]] is fundamentally different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

### Working with Fuzzy Inputs and Outputs
Traditional software development deals with defined inputs and outputs, ensuring the same action yields the same result consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at "fuzzy, subtle inputs" like human language and communication, and their outputs are not always identical, even if spiritually similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. This fuzziness means that product development must consider the model's accuracy rate: a product built on a model that is 60% accurate will differ significantly from one that is 95% or 99.5% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

### The Importance of Evals
To navigate this variability, a core skill for product builders, including product managers, is writing "evals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Evals are essentially "quizzes" or "tests" for models, gauging their knowledge or ability to respond to specific questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. They serve as benchmarks to measure a model's intelligence or capability in areas like creative writing, science, or competitive coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.

Evals are crucial because they help product teams understand the reliability of their models for specific use cases. If a model is only 60% right, the product design must compensate for that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. Evals also facilitate continuous learning for models; by designing hero use cases and measuring performance with evals, models can be fine-tuned to improve their accuracy and capability for desired product functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. The quality of AI is "capped" by the quality of the evals used to measure and train it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.

### [[integration_of_ai_in_business_and_product_development|Integration of AI in Business and Product Development]]
*   **Iterative Deployment:** OpenAI operates with a philosophy of "iterative deployment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. The idea is to ship products early and often, even when not fully understanding the models' capabilities, and then iterate in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. This co-evolution with society helps in learning about AI's strengths, weaknesses, and quirks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Model Maximalism:** This philosophy suggests that rather than spending extensive time building scaffolding around model imperfections, focus on pushing the envelope. The assumption is that better models will emerge in two months, blowing away current limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. Products built at the "edge of capabilities" will eventually "sing" as models improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.
*   **Bottoms-Up Approach:** Product development at OpenAI is largely bottoms-up, empowering engineers, product managers, designers, and researchers who are passionate about the products and understand model capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. Roadmaps serve as directional alignment rather than strict plans, acknowledging that technology changes too quickly for long-term rigid plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. This agility means being "happy making mistakes" and quickly rolling back features that don't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.
*   **PM Light Structure:** OpenAI maintains a relatively "PM light" organization (around 25 PMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. This encourages engineers to be product-focused and high-agency, making decisions independently without micromanagement from PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. The goal is for PMs to guide teams and be decisive when necessary, especially amidst ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.

### The Rise of Research in Product Teams
The future of product teams will increasingly see researchers integrated into every product team, not just at foundational model companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>. This is due to the growing importance of fine-tuning models for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>. Fine-tuning involves providing a model with many examples of desired outputs for given problems, teaching it to perform better at particular tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>. This process will become a core workflow for building most products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>.

### Internal Use of AI at OpenAI
OpenAI extensively uses its own AI internally for product development:
*   **Summarizing and drafting documents:** Teams use ChatGPT for tasks like summarizing notes and writing product specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.
*   **Writing evals:** Models can even assist in writing evals, further streamlining the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.
*   **[[prototyping_with_ai_in_product_development|Prototyping with AI in Product Development]] (Vibe Coding):** A significant shift involves using tools like Cursor and Windsurf for "vibe coding," where developers (or even non-developers like the Chief People Officer) quickly generate code for proofs of concept and demos by letting the model auto-complete and suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. This allows for rapid iteration and exploration of ideas, often replacing traditional Figma designs with interactive prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>.
*   **Ensembles of Models:** Internally, OpenAI uses "ensembles of models" much more than one might expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. For example, in customer support, different models (of varying sizes and capabilities like GPT-4o mini) are used for specific parts of a problem, combined with custom prompts and fine-tuning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>. This approach parallels how humans in a company, each with specialized skills, collaborate to solve complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.

## User Interface for AI: The Enduring Power of Chat
Despite some skepticism, chat interfaces are seen as an "amazing" and "incredibly universal" way to interact with LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. This is because chat mirrors natural human communication, allowing for "unstructured" and versatile interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. The magic of LLMs lies in their ability to understand the "complexity and nuances of human speech," making chat an interface "exactly fit to the power of these things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>. While more prescribed interfaces are suitable for high-volume, specific tasks, chat serves as a "catch-all" baseline for any open-ended interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.

## Optimism for the Future of AI
Kevin Wheel is a "big technology optimist," believing AI will drive economic, geopolitical, quality of life, and longevity advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>. While acknowledging potential "temporary dislocations" and individual impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>, he emphasizes the long-term benefits. ChatGPT, for instance, is seen as a powerful "reskilling app" for those interested in learning new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>.

### AI-Assisted Creativity
AI is already transforming creative work such as writing, design, and coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. Tools like Image Gen enable individuals with no artistic skill to generate creative outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>. Similarly, video models like Sora allow directors to brainstorm and iterate on dozens of different variations for complex scenes that previously cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and months of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. AI doesn't replace creativity but "can help you explore more" and "get to a better final result" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.

### Personalized Tutoring
One of the most important potential impacts of AI is personalized tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. Studies consistently show that combining classroom education with personalized tutoring leads to "multiple standard deviation improvements in learning speed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:15">[01:27:15]</a>. Despite models being capable and free, a widespread "two billion kid" AI personalized tutoring solution does not yet exist, representing a significant missed opportunity to change the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:02">[01:27:02]</a>.

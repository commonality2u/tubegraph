Nikhail Singhal, who has led large teams on influential consumer products like Facebook, Credit Karma, Google Hangouts, and Google Photos, emphasizes the importance of [[leadership_principles_and_skills | leadership development]] and [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | effective feedback]]. He notes that many product managers (PMs) struggle with career progression and personal growth, often due to a lack of proper training in management and an inability to perceive their own developmental areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

## The State of Management Training in Tech

Singhal observes that the tech industry has historically fallen short in training managers, a phenomenon he believes will be seen as a significant oversight by future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. The prevailing belief that a good coder is ready to manage, or someone who can talk is ready to product manage, creates a loose coupling between building skills and teaching people how to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. This lack of formal training leads to numerous challenges, including issues with bias, and the inability to effectively coach and resolve [[overcoming_fear_of_giving_candid_feedback | development areas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.

## Advice for New Managers

For those transitioning into management roles, Singhal offers two key pieces of advice:

1.  **Share the Steering Wheel**: Management is not about simply dividing and conquering or teaching someone to ride a bike by letting go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. Instead, he likens it to riding in a sidecar on a motorcycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. The manager's role is to give counsel, recognizing that they are attached to the journey but not solely in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.
2.  **Earn the Right to Manage**: Managers often assume power simply by organizational title, not by earning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. Singhal suggests managers should be like a vampire, needing to be invited in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. He advises asking direct reports, "What can I help you with?" to invite them to accept assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>. This approach ensures that when help is needed, the manager is welcomed and can provide effective support in specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.

## The Rise of the Senior IC Path

Singhal believes the increasing focus on the individual contributor (IC) path, particularly at the senior level, is one of the best developments in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. Historically, many ICs were prematurely promoted into management without adequate training, leading to average managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.

The IC path allows individuals to deepen their expertise in areas like:
*   Crafting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>
*   Market ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>
*   Organizational ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>
*   Domain expertise (e.g., ML, Hardware) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>
*   Team expertise (e.g., managing managers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>
*   Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>

This specialization is more valuable to growth companies seeking to build specific products than general management experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. The IC track is seen as a correction to a long-standing "bug" in product management, where product managers automatically became managers due to their title, unlike in engineering and design where IC paths are well-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

## The Power of Community in [[hiring_and_developing_growth_leaders | Leadership Development]]

Given the weakness in formal [[hiring_and_developing_growth_leaders | leadership training]] within companies, Singhal champions the role of community for [[leadership_principles_and_skills | leadership development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. Whether internal or external, communities provide:
*   Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>
*   Authentic conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>
*   A sense of not being alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>
*   Opportunities to share best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>

He highlights the CPO community he founded, "The Skip," which grew out of informal coaching calls during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. This community allows Chief Product Officers to share and solve common challenges, fostering a sense of shared experience and providing actionable strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. Community learning is a powerful propellant for growth, especially for new managers or those in diverse groups who may not feel safe sharing with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>.

## [[effective_feedback_and_listening_strategies | Understanding Feedback]] and the "Shadows of Superpowers"

A significant challenge for senior [[hiring_and_developing_growth_leaders | leaders]] is recognizing their own [[overcoming_fear_of_giving_candid_feedback | development areas]], especially when these areas are "hiding in the shadows of their superpowers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. Singhal explains that what made a person successful in the past may hinder them at the next level, requiring them to "rebuild or relearn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

*   **The Paradox**: A strength at one level can become a weakness at another. For example, a "great collaborator" who thrives when people agree may struggle with senior colleagues who hold different functions or views, as their insistence on agreement becomes a hinderance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>. Similarly, strong growth drivers may struggle with innovation, or excellent [[developing_storytelling_skills | storytellers]] may neglect details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.

*   **The Challenge of Self-Perception**: Individuals often dismiss contradictory [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] because it challenges their identity and what they believe got them to their current position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. Managers might even dismiss such feedback as an anomaly or personal attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.

### Getting Real Feedback

To overcome this, Singhal stresses the importance of seeking "real feedback" rather than just formal feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. This requires:
1.  **Strong [[the_art_and_importance_of_listening_for_leaders | Listening]] Skills**: Actively listen to feedback without justifying or refuting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. As Jules Walters suggests, simply say "thank you" even if you're "melting inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.
2.  **Repeating Back**: Repeat the feedback back to the giver, articulating it clearly to show internalization and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. This makes people feel safer to provide more candid input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.
3.  **Creating Safety**: Establish an environment where people feel no worry about retaliation or concern when giving feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. Managers can do this by publicly acknowledging and thanking individuals for specific pieces of feedback, demonstrating that their input is valued and acted upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
4.  **Triangulation**: Seek feedback from a diverse group of people – those who see you all the time, and those who don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.

Singhal's personal breakthrough came from listening to contradictory [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | feedback]] from someone he trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>, prompting him to reassess his own superpower of being highly opinionated and adapt it for executive leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.

## The Long Career Arc and Finding a North Star

Singhal notes that careers are significantly longer now, potentially 60 years, meaning many professionals are only halfway through their working life in their 30s or 40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. He cautions against the "dog track" phenomenon, where individuals chase a single goal (like becoming a VP or starting a company) and then feel lost once it's achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.

To avoid mental health challenges and maintain motivation, he advises thinking about the "second thing" or "skip job" – what comes after the immediate career goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>. This means cultivating a North Star that ensures continuous engagement and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.

Possible North Stars in "Act 3" of a career fall into two categories:
1.  **Scaled Economics**: Continuing to pursue wealth accumulation through investing or private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
2.  **Giving**: Finding ways to contribute to others and society. This could involve content creation, volunteering, or founding mission-driven companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. While "taking and creating" is acceptable in earlier career stages, he suggests "giving" is the path to long-term fulfillment, regardless of economic status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

Singhal himself plans to dedicate his "Act 3" to [[leadership_principles_and_skills | coaching]] and "lifting up those that with the right advice at the right time can change their trajectory," viewing this as a product problem to be scaled authentically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, Singhal's advice for every PM is to proactively shape their career narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. By articulating the problems they solved, skills they built, and challenges they overcame (using "I" instead of "we"), they can create a compelling story that drives their career forward, regardless of immediate promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>.

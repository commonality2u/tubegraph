[[Nikita Biers approach to consumer apps | Nikita Bier]], known for building and launching numerous top-ranking apps, offers unique insights into the world of consumer application development. He sold his first major success, TBH, to Facebook for over $30 million, and his second, Gas, to Discord for millions more, all with lean teams and minimal funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. His approach emphasizes deep user understanding, rapid experimentation, and a focus on core human motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Early Ventures and the Pivot to Consumer Apps

Bier's initial product, Potify, was a web app designed to help American voters understand the financial impact of political policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. This tool went "super viral," gaining about four million users during an election season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. Despite initial success and securing government contracts, including one with the Obama Administration, a government shutdown led him to realize he disliked selling software to governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. He then decided to pivot to building consumer apps, offering to return investor money (which was declined) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

This pivot involved a challenging recalibration from web to mobile app development, which has a "low margin for error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. Bier holds a "dogmatic view" that "every tap on a mobile app is a miracle" because users churn very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. Over four to five years, his team built about 15 different apps—including mapping, chat, and event apps—experiencing many "duds" before finding consistent success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. This period helped them develop a "muscle to understand what people want and how to actually make things grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Targeting Teens

A key [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | strategy]] that emerged from this period was focusing on teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. This is because:
*   **Malleable Habits**: Teens' habits are more flexible, making them more likely to adopt new communication products compared to adults who are "fixed into their habits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   **Invitation Behavior**: Younger users (13-18) are significantly more likely to invite others to new apps. The number of invitations sent per user drops by 20% for every additional year of age from 13 to 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.
*   **Daily Interaction**: Teens "see each other every day," creating a constant urgency to communicate and connect, which is vital for [[Strategies for achieving productmarket fit | network effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.
*   **Cost of Acquisition**: Building for adults generally means relying on paid advertising, requiring "a huge amount of venture capital to finance that user acquisition pipeline," which is "basically impossible" for a seed-stage startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

Bier notes that the number of people one texts peaks around age 21 and then collapses, only rising again later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. Therefore, for communication tools with network effects, targeting the upward curve of social connections (teens) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.

## TBH: A Case Study in Latent Demand and Viral Product-Market Fit

The inspiration for TBH came from observing trends on Snapchat where kids played a game called "TBH" (To Be Honest), posting emojis for others to provide positive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:00">[25:22:00]</a>. Simultaneously, Saraha, an anonymous messaging app entirely in Arabic, was the number one app in the U.S., indicating "latent demand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>.

[[Harnessing inflections and insights for startup innovation | Latent demand]] exists where people are trying to obtain a particular value by going through a "very distortive process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>. By crystallizing this motivation, intense adoption can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:00">[26:54:00]</a>. Recognizing that Saraha often led to negative messages, Bier designed TBH to only allow positive affirmations through pre-authored polls (e.g., "who has the best smile?"), thus solving the underlying user need for positive disclosure without the bullying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>.

TBH's adoption was "literally explosive," with one school sending 450,000 messages in the first seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:33:00">[28:33:00]</a>. The team had to geofence the app to manage server scaling, giving them slack to control growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:00">[28:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>. Bier predicted TBH would hit number one in six days, based on early numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>.

### Testing and Validation
To test new apps effectively, Bier developed a "reproducible testing process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. For TBH, they seeded the app into a Georgia school with the earliest start date, aiming for "enough intensity of adoption and density for a social network to start to get the flywheel spinning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:00">[30:57:00]</a>. This involved targeted ads and creating dedicated Instagram accounts that followed students, knowing high schoolers often put their school in their bio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>. This aggressive initial seeding was for *testing*, not scalable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:45:00">[30:45:00]</a>. The goal was to eliminate confounding variables and quickly determine if the product had "legs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>.

### [[Strategies for effective user research and its business impact | User Feedback and Product-Market Fit]]
Bier recommends implementing 24/7 live chat customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>. This provides a "white glove experience" and is the "best vehicle for getting feedback and doing user research," as users "literally tell you the problem they're having" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:18:00">[33:18:00]</a>.

[[Strategies for achieving productmarket fit | Product-market fit]] is often evident by chaos: servers crashing, needing to geofence to control growth, and a feeling of being "spread thin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:15:00">[35:15:00]</a>. As his friend Roger Dicky put it, "If your product's working, you'll know... if there's any uncertainty, it's not working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>. Users will be "fighting to get into it," leading to metrics like "hourly actives per day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>.

## Lessons from Facebook's Early Growth Team

After nine weeks, TBH was sold to Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:04:00">[37:04:00]</a>. Selling a company is "one of the most draining processes," especially when a small team faces Facebook's 80-person M&A SWAT team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:22:00">[37:22:00]</a>.

As a product manager at Facebook, Bier found "very little product management" actually being done in terms of direct product involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[39:30:00]</a>. PMs primarily write documents, act as "team secretaries," and seek approvals, being "completely detached from the design process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:55:00">[39:55:00]</a>. Bier, who considers himself "at the core... a designer" and good at "designing the things that make it grow," found this separation challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>. He advocates that for zero-to-one initiatives, product people "should be designing the hierarchy, the pixels, the flows, everything" because "products live and die in the pixels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:11:00">[51:11:00]</a>.

A major challenge for large companies like Facebook in launching new zero-to-one products is risk aversion and the difficulty of verbalizing true human motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:21:00">[42:21:00]</a>. Bier categorizes why people download apps into three main reasons:
1.  **Make or save money**: e.g., WhatsApp (free texting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:00">[42:58:00]</a>
2.  **Find a mate**: e.g., Tinder, Snapchat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:13:00">[43:13:00]</a>
3.  **Unplug from reality**: e.g., Netflix, Fortnite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a>

Presenting these "nuanced reasons" to seasoned professionals who "care about how something might reflect on them personally" is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:31:00">[43:31:00]</a>. Large companies are also slow to respond to market signals, often taking 12 to 24 months to react to competitive threats, making it easier for them to copy existing successful products rather than innovate completely new concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:07:00">[45:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:01:00">[46:01:00]</a>. This is due to internal incentives focused on defensible ideas for performance reviews rather than hunches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:11:00">[46:11:00]</a>.

## Gas: Reinventing Growth & Overcoming Hoaxes

After Facebook, Bier was motivated to explore monetizing an app like TBH, specifically the top support request: "Can I pay to reveal who sent me polls?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:21:00">[56:21:00]</a>. Gas was a "zero to one development cycle" despite the conceptual similarities to TBH, requiring a complete reinvention of growth systems due to changes in regulatory environments (e.g., inability to send texts directly from servers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:32:00">[59:32:00]</a>.

Bier strongly advocates for ethical growth, operating "by the book" and "above board" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37:00">[01:00:37:00]</a>. He believes the internet (like the Gia hypothesis) responds to threats; if you "do the wrong thing by users, the will come back and get even" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21:00">[01:01:21:00]</a>.

Gas was designed to foster positive interactions, aiming to make teens feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00:00">[01:02:00:00]</a>. They even implemented a system to ensure "everyone got a vote" by putting names into polls more frequently if they hadn't been voted on recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50:00">[01:03:50:00]</a>.

### The Human Trafficking Hoax
Gas faced a severe, fabricated human trafficking hoax that plagued its growth, leading 3% of users to delete accounts daily at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42:00">[01:04:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23:00">[01:07:23:00]</a>. This hoax spreads easily because claiming an app is dangerous garners attention and followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13:00">[01:05:13:00]</a>. Bier fought this "made up hoax" on "every vector," including:
*   Insisting on specific headlines for media interviews (e.g., "Gas app is not for human trafficking") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39:00">[01:06:39:00]</a>.
*   Calling school superintendents and police chiefs to get public retractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53:00">[01:06:53:00]</a>.
*   Asking Apple to remove review bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02:00">[01:07:02:00]</a>.
*   Creating a TikTok video (made by his girlfriend) to explain the hoax, shown to users deleting accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08:00">[01:07:08:00]</a>.
*   Contacting the CEO of TikTok to remove videos spreading misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11:00">[01:09:11:00]</a>.
The key insight was to ensure the hoax was "less viral than your app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35:00">[01:09:35:00]</a>.

### Naming Matters
During development, they tested different names like "Crush" and "Melt." "Crush" with a pink icon saw significantly dropped invitation rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01:00">[01:16:01:00]</a>. This was because, despite the app indexing 60-65% women, boys didn't want to invite their friends to an app called "Crush" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18:00">[01:16:18:00]</a>. Renaming it "Gas" with a black icon and flame increased the invite rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50:00">[01:16:50:00]</a>.

## Building Durable Consumer Apps: A "Black Swan Event"

[[Harnessing inflections and insights for startup innovation | Durability]] for communication or social products is a "Black Swan event," with "tremendous amount of randomness" and typically only "one every decade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50:00">[01:18:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03:00">[01:19:03:00]</a>. However, [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growing a product]] "can be a science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:26:00">[01:19:26:00]</a>.

Bier's personal motivation is the "most thrilling drug": watching an app "take over the Internet" as a small team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50:00">[01:19:50:00]</a>. He prefers this high-impact, financially favorable model over the long commitment and management responsibilities of running a large corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06:00">[01:21:06:00]</a>.

## Key Tactics for Consumer App Success

### iOS 18 Contact Permissions
The new iOS 18 contact permissions significantly impact how apps can find friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02:00">[01:24:02:00]</a>. The new flow, where users must manually select individual contacts from an alphabetical list, is "egregiously bad" and will make it "very difficult to find friends on apps going forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42:00">[01:24:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:33:00">[01:25:33:00]</a>. This change will likely entrench incumbents and eliminate the feature altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26:00">[01:26:26:00]</a>. This creates an opportunity for new apps that can "reinvent what contact sync is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51:00">[01:25:51:00]</a>.

### Inverting the Time to Value (Aha Moment)
It's crucial to get users to the "aha moment" in "seconds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06:00">[01:27:06:00]</a>. In 2024, attention spans are extremely short, so if value isn't demonstrated in the first three seconds, users will churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27:00">[01:27:27:00]</a>. For example, with the app Dupe, Bier advised focusing on a single, core feature (finding the cheapest product online) and making it iconic by allowing users to type "dp.com" in front of any URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06:00">[01:28:06:00]</a>. This creative use of a non-traditional mechanism quickly exposed value and led to viral adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:23:00">[01:30:23:00]</a>.

### Product Development and Growth Alignment
When advising companies, Bier looks at:
*   **Analytics**: How users are distributing the app today.
*   **Activation Milestones**: What users must hit to become activated, and what's preventing it.
*   **Funnels**: A deep look at every user funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50:00">[01:32:50:00]</a>.

He stresses that marketing and product growth should not be separated; they are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:13:00">[01:33:13:00]</a>. Everything from ads to the in-app experience to invitation mechanisms must be aligned for successful user acquisition and flywheel spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55:00">[01:33:55:00]</a>.

### Sequential Validation
For zero-to-one product development, validate things in sequence:
1.  Will people use the core flow?
2.  Will people spread it within their peer group?
3.  Will it hop peer groups?
Execute at 100% on the specific thing being validated at each stage, while "half-assing" the rest, to get clear signal and avoid scope creep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50:00">[01:11:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36:00">[01:12:36:00]</a>. Aim to condense conditional statements to about "four things that must be true" for the product to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54:00">[01:12:54:00]</a>. This comes back to the core advice of getting good at rapid testing and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07:00">[01:13:07:00]</a>.

Ultimately, truly successful consumer apps are built by understanding deeply what motivates users, being ruthless in prioritizing features that drive that core value, and creatively leveraging every tool and mechanism available to accelerate activation and spread.

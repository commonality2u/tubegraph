At DoorDash, there are significant opportunities to leverage AI for enhancing productivity within data teams and integrating it into the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

## Enhancing Productivity with AI Tools

One area of excitement is in making the analytics team more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. DoorDash's analytics team has a long-standing practice of holding "office hours," a tradition that began eight years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>. These sessions were initially designed to provide support for teams that lacked bandwidth, offering help with SQL, reviewing work, and acting as thought partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>.

The vision for AI integration is to [[Empowering Nontechnical Teams with AI Tools | empower individuals]], including those who still rely on office hours, to use AI for self-service tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>. This includes using AI to:
*   **Edit queries**: For instance, a user could provide a query and ask AI to adjust it for a specific business segment, like the grocery business, to view metrics such as Gross Order Value (GOV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.
*   **Generate queries**: The goal is to [[Empowering Nontechnical Teams with AI Tools | empower non-technical users]] to perform data tasks on their own, reducing the demand on the analytics team's bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>.

Essentially, this involves developing a chatbot that allows anyone in the company to receive advice on writing SQL queries and querying data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. This internal tool is called "Ask Data AI," named after the internal Slack channel that served as an open Q&A forum for data-related questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>.

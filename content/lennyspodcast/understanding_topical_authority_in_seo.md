Topical authority is considered "the most important, least understood part of SEO" by Ethan Smith, CEO of Graphite, a leading growth agency specializing in [[seo_as_a_growth_strategy | SEO and content marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:01">[03:58:01]</a>. It represents a significant evolution from older SEO metrics like PageRank.

## Evolution of Authority in SEO

Historically, Google's PageRank system prioritized websites based on the number of links pointing to them, similar to academic citations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>. The more links a site received from other sites, the higher its perceived importance and ranking potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. This led many to focus solely on building backlinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:45">[01:09:45]</a>.

However, Google's understanding of authority has become much more complex over time, incorporating various inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>:
*   **Links from other sites (referring domains)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>
*   **Non-SEO traffic**: The amount of traffic a site receives from other channels (e.g., direct, paid, email, social) is an authority signal, as Google tracks this data through services like Chrome and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.
*   **Shares and social activity**: Social engagement indicates relevance and credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.
*   **Branded search**: The frequency with which users search for a brand name directly in Google is a strong authority signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.

### The Shift to Topical Authority

Crucially, authority is now *topical*, not just domain-wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. Google doesn't merely look at a site's overall authority but assesses "what you're known for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>. Recent Google helpful content updates emphasize "domain experts" who have specific, narrow expertise, rather than general knowledge across all topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>.

Google determines a site's topical authority through:
*   **Anchor text of backlinks**: What words are used to link to your site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.
*   **Content of shared material**: What specific content is being shared on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.
*   **Branded search queries**: Searches that combine a brand name with a specific topic (e.g., "Masterclass Gordon Ramsay") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>.

These inputs help Google understand the specific themes or areas a site has disproportionate authority in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>.

## Examples of Topical Authority in Action

### Jello Shots Recipe Site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>
A recipe site published a viral blog post about "10 jello shots worth the hangover," which gained millions of likes and pins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. While the post itself ranked well for "jello shots," the entire domain also began ranking for "vodka recipes" and "whiskey recipes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. This occurred even though these related pages were not directly linked from the viral post, demonstrating how topical authority for "jello shots" extended to semantically related alcoholic drinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.

### MasterClass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>
Early on, MasterClass had authority for instructor names like "Gordon Ramsay" but not for general food terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>. By focusing on content adjacent to Gordon Ramsay's known expertise, such as "beef wellington," "steak," or "how to poach an egg," MasterClass was able to rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:39">[01:12:39]</a>. This strategy allowed them to outrank competitors with higher overall domain authority by leveraging their specific topical strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.

## Leveraging Topical Authority in Strategy

### Topics vs. Keywords
Instead of focusing on individual keywords, it's now more effective to target "topics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. A single page typically ranks for 200 to 2,000 different keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:55">[01:32:55]</a>.
*   **Search Volume**: The effective search volume for a topic (e.g., "best cameras") is the sum of all its variations (e.g., "best digital cameras," "cameras best"), which can be 10x higher than a single keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>.
*   **Content Efficiency**: Focusing on topics avoids wasting resources by creating multiple pages for similar keywords that Google already understands as related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:47">[01:33:47]</a>.
*   **Fulfilling Intent**: A page should fulfill the intent of all relevant keywords within its topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:06">[01:34:06]</a>. If a sub-theme is missed (e.g., health benefits of butter lettuce), the content may not be comprehensive enough to rank well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>.

To identify topics, look for groups of keywords where Google's search results are consistently similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. If results for "five-year plan template" and "five-year plan examples" significantly overlap, Google views them as part of a single concept or topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>.

### Branching Out with Adjacent Topics
Think of topics as part of a larger "ingredient graph" or tree structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. Starting with strong topical authority in one narrow area, companies can then expand to "adjacent" topics. For example, if a site ranks well for "jello shots," it can then pursue other types of alcohol, then other drinks, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>.

### How Google Determines Relationships
Google dynamically generates graphs of relationships between topics by:
*   Crawling the entire web to find co-occurrences of terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>.
*   Analyzing search refinements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>.
*   Looking at co-occurring results within search queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">[01:15:58]</a>.

This implies that Google's understanding of topics is not based on static, expert-curated taxonomies but rather on continuous algorithmic analysis of web data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.

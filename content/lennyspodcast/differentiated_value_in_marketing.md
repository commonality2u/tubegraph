[[developing_differentiated_value | Differentiated value]] is a core concept in marketing and sales, answering the crucial question: "Why pick us over the other Alternatives?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a> It defines the unique benefits a product or company can deliver that no other solution can provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.

## Importance in Sales and Purchasing
For B2B software, 40% to 60% of purchase processes end in no decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The majority of these "no decisions" aren't because the old solution is better, but because buyers cannot confidently figure out how to make a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. They opt to delay, viewing it as the safe, risk-free option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Buyers are often overwhelmed by information, leading to indecision and fear of making a bad choice that could impact their job or reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. Effectively communicating [[developing_differentiated_value | differentiated value]] helps overcome this indecision by:
*   **Providing clarity:** Giving buyers a clear picture of the market and how different solutions approach problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
*   **Teaching how to buy:** Guiding customers on what criteria to consider for their specific needs, reducing stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Reducing risk:** Offering reassurances like money-back guarantees, support, or demonstrating an understanding of implementation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.

> "The buyer is 80% of the way through their buying journey by the time they talk to your sales rep. Yeah, maybe, but they might be 80% of the way to saying 'nope, I'm not buying nothing' and in fact that's true 60% of the time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>

## Crafting a Sales Pitch based on Differentiated Value
A powerful sales pitch should reflect [[product_positioning_strategy | product positioning]] and be built around [[developing_differentiated_value | differentiated value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. It moves beyond merely demonstrating features to explaining the value those features deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>.

### Sales Pitch Structure
A typical sales pitch framework consists of two main parts:

1.  **The Setup:** Not about your company, but about the market and your unique point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
    *   **Insight into the Market:** Your unique perspective or "problem inside the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This should resonate with your target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. For example, Help Scout's insight is that customer service for digital businesses is a growth driver, not a cost center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
    *   **Pros and Cons of Alternative Solutions:** Paint a picture of the entire market, including shared inboxes, help desk software, or even doing nothing (status quo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Be honest and give credit where due to alternatives, reinforcing your own [[developing_differentiated_value | differentiated value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
    *   **Perfect World Conclusion:** Gain agreement on what an ideal solution would look like, based on the insights and alternatives discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. If the customer agrees with this vision, you've already won them over, as your solution is designed to meet these specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.

2.  **The Follow Through:** Focuses on your [[developing_differentiated_value | differentiated value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
    *   **Introduction of Your Product:** Briefly state your market category, e.g., "customer service software for digital businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>.
    *   **Differentiated Value Demonstration:** Showcase how your product delivers on the "perfect world" characteristics agreed upon in the setup. Focus on the value provided by unique features, not just the features themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>.
        *   **Example (Help Scout):** "As easy to use as an inbox" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a> (value) shown by its inbox-like interface (feature). "Never have to outgrow it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a> (value) shown by assignment and prioritization features. "Delivers amazing customer experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a> (value) shown by customer channel choice and personalized interactions (not ticket numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
        *   **Example (LevelJump):** Their unique capability of being built on Salesforce means sales enablement data integrates with sales data, allowing measurement of improved time to first deal or quota, leading to faster revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.
    *   **Proof:** Provide evidence that you can deliver on your claims, often through customer case studies or independent verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
    *   **Handling Objections (Optional):** Address potential silent objections like cost, adoption difficulty, or security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. This arms the internal champion with answers for other stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
    *   **The Ask:** Clearly state the desired next step in the sales process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

### Collaboration and Implementation
Defining [[developing_differentiated_value | differentiated value]] and building the sales pitch requires cross-functional collaboration, ideally involving product, marketing, and sales teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
*   **Product teams** understand the product's unique capabilities and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.
*   **Sales teams** provide insights into common objections, customer priorities, and typical deal progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.
*   **Marketing teams** often steward the [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]] and translate it into sales collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

To test and roll out a new pitch:
*   Start by training your best sales rep on the new pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.
*   Have them test it with qualified new prospects and gather feedback to refine it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.
*   Once the top rep is convinced it's better, they can then teach and sell the new pitch to the rest of the sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.

This process can significantly impact sales metrics, potentially doubling the number of deals converting from first calls to opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. The entire process, from refining [[product_positioning_strategy | positioning]] to rolling out a new pitch, can take as little as two weeks to a month for motivated teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid
*   **Relying on FOMO:** Pressuring indecisive customers with Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) makes them *less* likely to close a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. It adds more stress to an already stressed buyer, leading to paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a>.
*   **Assuming "New" is Inherently Better:** Simply stating your product is "new" or based on a "trend" is often insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. Buyers want to know the specific value they can't get elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. Trends are often not unique, and competitors can leverage the same information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>.
*   **Exclusive Category Creation:** While category creation is a valid strategy for building a large business, it is not the *only* way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. Most legendary businesses did not create their categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. Many successful companies start by dominating a niche within an existing category, then expanding (known as "bowling pin strategy") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **Ignoring the "Job to be Done" of the Champion:** Beyond convincing customers that your product does the job they need, you must also help the internal champion navigate the decision-making process without fear of negative repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

By focusing on clear [[developing_differentiated_value | differentiated value]] and teaching customers how to buy, companies can significantly improve their sales effectiveness and conversion rates.

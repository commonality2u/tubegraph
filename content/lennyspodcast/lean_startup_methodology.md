The [[Lean Startup methodology]] is a framework developed by Eric Ries, known for its significant influence on startup culture and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Ries is recognized for coining or popularizing terms such as MVP (Minimum Viable Product), pivot, AB testing, customer development, continuous deployment, and vanity metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Core Philosophy
At its heart, the [[Lean Startup methodology]] is a scientific theory that posits "whatever works is Lean Startup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>. It's about coping with high uncertainty, especially in the context of building new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. The core belief is that positive change can be made through the building of organizations from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.

It encourages a respect for truth and scientific thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. The approach combines descriptive elements, naming concepts that already happen, with prescriptive elements, deducing what to do based on hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>. This iterative process allows for learning whether a hypothesis is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

## History and Evolution
The book *The Lean Startup* was released in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:59">[05:10:59]</a>. Initially, the ideas faced skepticism, with people yelling at Ries in meetings for suggesting concepts like shipping product 50 times a day, which was considered impossible at a time when monthly deployments were considered advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Ries initially blogged anonymously to avoid career suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

Over time, the methodology evolved from an "insurgent revival" to the default approach, with many of its concepts becoming widely accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. Ries aimed to show how Lean Startup integrates with other methodologies like Six Sigma, lean manufacturing, design thinking, customer development, and DevOps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Key Concepts

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The MVP is not about building a stripped-down, crash-prone product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Instead, it asks: for a given hypothesis, what is the most efficient way to get the necessary validation to determine if the hypothesis is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>? A successful test considers customer demands in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

The goal is to contain the liability of making a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Founders should be willing to expose their product to initial users and receive critical feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. The cost of a customer disliking a product is often just them saying "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

The "minimum" aspect of an MVP is highly flexible and context-specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. If expectations for quality are high, then the MVP should have fewer features but those features must be of high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Conversely, if more features are desired, the quality bar for each may need to be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. The objective is to build "as little as necessary" to test a hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

A practical tip for defining an MVP is to list necessary features, then cut the list in half, and then in half again, aiming to be "uncomfortably small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. Often, teams overestimate the necessary work by one or two orders of magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

A common misconception is that "Lean means cheap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Another is that Lean is opposed to having a vision, or that experimentation only leads to local maxima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Ries clarifies that an MVP is about validating fundamental assumptions, not compromising on quality where it matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Quality is defined by the customer, and without knowing the customer, the definition of quality is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

The goal is to avoid building something that customers don't want, which is the ultimate waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. The story of IMVU's "teleport" feature, which was a low-fidelity hack but perceived as advanced by users, illustrates that less can be more, and customer perception defines value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### Pivot
A pivot is defined as a change in strategy without a change in vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>. The founder's vision itself often evolves through the process of building the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.

Many startups, particularly B2B companies, frequently pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. Often, 90% of the work in the first version of a product is thrown away, regardless of its quality, making it crucial to learn quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

The essence of the MVP and pivot is to find out as soon as possible what the catastrophic thing that will destroy a company is, so there's still time to do something about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:34">[01:28:34]</a>. If a startup cannot fail, it cannot learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>.

For Founders contemplating a pivot:
1.  **Acknowledge the situation:** If you're asking whether you should pivot, you likely already know the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
2.  **Fixed-time experiments:** Give yourself a fixed period (e.g., six weeks) to try a decisive action to make the current product work, focusing 100% of efforts on one thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.
3.  **Explore new ideas:** If the current path isn't working, allocate a fixed amount of time (even a weekend) to explore a new idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Encourage team members to share what they would want to be working on if they could start the company over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
4.  **Embrace honest feedback:** It's okay to admit when something isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. The difficulty lies in psychological defenses against admitting failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.

> "People act like having a startup fail is the worst thing that can happen to you... far worse is to be in a company that won't die, a zombie undead company that you hate but you can't leave." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>

The [[resilience_in_startups | mental health crisis among Founders]] is exacerbated by situations where they are stuck in a company that is not truly succeeding, which can be worse than a direct failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. Founders should be willing to get fired for their beliefs or to step aside if the company's path no longer aligns with their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

## Unpopular Concepts
One concept Ries thought would gain more traction but didn't is the "engagement loop," contrasting it with the widely adopted "viral loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:17">[02:06:17]</a>. While viral loops explain how products grow from new customers acquired by past customers, engagement loops focus on how people stick with a product and return to it over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:23">[02:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>. This includes understanding the triggers (synthetic notifications, organic notifications, or user's internal positioning/needs) that bring a customer back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:13">[02:07:13]</a>. Ries notes that the science of engagement is as measurable and precise as viral loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:30">[02:08:30]</a>.

## AI and Lean Startup
AI is seen as a management technology that manages intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. It changes the individual's span of control, as it excels at summarization, potentially reducing the need for large managerial hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

AI's ability to drive high-rate experimentation means communication channels will become saturated with AI-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This could lead to a future where AI-powered marketplaces offer greater fairness by filtering proposals based on defined procurement policies, rather than traditional gatekeeping structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Governance and Human Flourishing
Ries believes that a company's purpose should be to maximize human flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>. Founders should build companies with values aligned with this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This means embedding these values into the company's structure so that promises of positive impact are kept even if original founders are no longer present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:13">[01:35:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:17">[01:35:17]</a>.

Practical ways to embed values include:
*   Becoming a Public Benefit Corporation or Social Purpose Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:01">[01:44:01]</a>.
*   Donating a percentage of the company to a foundation with diverse trustees (e.g., tribal leaders for companies interacting with indigenous cultures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:17">[01:44:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>.
*   Establishing a Board Mission Pledge, requiring board members to prioritize the company's mission over narrow shareholder interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:32">[01:44:32]</a>.
*   Using an "LTSV" (long-term social venture) financing instrument where investors commit to supporting the company's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:45">[01:44:45]</a>.

This approach is not merely virtue signaling but a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:18">[01:56:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:20">[01:56:20]</a>. Companies dedicated to human flourishing can achieve greater financial success and loyalty than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:01">[01:53:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:03">[01:53:03]</a>. The "shareholder primacy" theory of corporations is seen as fundamentally flawed, even for maximizing returns, as it often leads to short-term thinking and value destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:46">[01:53:46]</a>. Companies structured around principles like long-term thinking and customer centricity, such as Amazon, often outperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:52">[01:53:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:54">[01:53:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>.

Founders are encouraged to think for themselves and give permission to try new approaches, even if they deviate from conventional wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>.

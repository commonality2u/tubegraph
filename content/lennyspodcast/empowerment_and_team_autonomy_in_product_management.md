Ramp approaches product management by optimizing for speed, thinking from first principles, and [[empowering_product_teams | empowering individual team members]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The company's unique approach to product development prioritizes velocity and impact, allowing them to achieve significant results with relatively small teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Key Principles of Empowerment and Autonomy

### Velocity as a Core Principle
Velocity is central to Ramp's culture, influencing its product development process, team incentives, hiring, promotion, decision-making, and organizational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This focus originated from a small team operating within a large market opportunity during the pandemic, emphasizing execution speed over path selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. High velocity allows teams to iterate quickly and achieve impact over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. It also attracts top talent, as many individuals seek environments where they can actively build and ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Furthermore, high velocity de-risks decisions by making the cost of a wrong decision very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

Examples of Ramp's velocity:
*   Built a competitor to MX in three months with around eight engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   Built a competitor to Expensify six months later, hitting $100 million in annual revenue with fewer than 50 total R&D staff (under 40 engineers and three Product Managers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   Developed an accounts payable product (a competitor to Bill.com) in three months with a team of three engineers, one designer, and one Product Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This product now moves billions of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

The "recipe" for this velocity involves:
*   **Small, single-threaded teams** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>
*   Providing necessary resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>
*   Setting big, lofty goals with tight timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>
*   Shielding teams from organizational chaos until they find product-market fit or early traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>

### Single-Threaded Focus
At Ramp, "single-threaded" means each individual or team has only one core goal to focus on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This involves removing any other tasks or processes that might distract them from that primary objective, such as research, production engineering, or external processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. For example, the team that launched the "Flex" product was purely focused on e-commerce companies' cash flow needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Shielding Teams
Leaders at Ramp actively protect teams from distractions and "fires":
*   **Production Engineers** handle escalations, bugs, and issues on a rotational basis, protecting core development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Product Operators** shield Product Managers from tasks like documentation, release management, customer requests, and other operational chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   New, "big bet" products are assigned to sub-teams pulled from different areas, ensuring they don't have existing product responsibilities to maintain focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Lofty Goals
Ramp sets ambitious goals by leveraging:
*   **Market Comparables**: Publicly traded companies like Bill.com, Expensify, Concur, and Coupa serve as motivating benchmarks, de-risking business decisions by proving market existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **Visionary Design**: Significant time is invested in crafting future-state designs and Figma prototypes, which serve as a powerful source of motivation for teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Revenue-Driven Mindset**: The company's focus on revenue goals provides clear objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### Context Over Control
Ramp empowers its teams by prioritizing context over direct control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Leaders align with teams on goals, hypotheses, supporting data, and potential solutions, rather than being prescriptive about the solutions themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The belief is that the best solutions come from teams closest to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Leadership's primary role is to continually provide context, especially information from high-level meetings teams might miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

The "contract" between Product Management leadership and teams is their strategy and roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Teams are expected to highlight risks and one-way decisions requiring senior input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This approach builds trust over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Team goals are posted weekly for peer review, and one-on-ones focus on what the team needs from the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

Large initiatives go through a product review process with the Head of Product and Head of Design, where teams explicitly ask for specific feedback and highlight key risks and tradeoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Major intervention often occurs when deciding to move a product from beta to general availability, stress-testing hypotheses and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

### Quality and Velocity
Ramp believes that product velocity can actually lead to higher quality because issues can be fixed quickly, without long review or release cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. To ensure high velocity doesn't "tank the business," Ramp uses control mechanisms:
*   **Voice of Customer Process**: Every negative review is shared monthly with the tech lead, Product Manager, and designer responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **NPS and CSAT Reporting**: Regularly reported back to teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   **Operational Overhead**: Measured as the percentage of support tickets originating from a product area, normalized by user count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. Teams are contracted to keep this low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **Direct Bug Assignment**: Bugs are directly assigned to the engineer on call, fostering immediate pain points and quick fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **Confusion Metric**: Tracks support tickets due to customer confusion. If this number is elevated, teams are prevented from shipping new features until they address the clarity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

### Avoiding Burnout
Ramp links velocity directly to avoiding burnout. The belief is that burnout often occurs when effort is put into things that don't move or have impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. By allowing teams to build great products for customers and get into a "flow state" where work feels thrilling, velocity can prevent burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. The goal of management is to make every team member feel ownership over their goals, as if it's "their mini company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.

### Minimal Planning, Maximum Doing
A core philosophy at Ramp is: "Any second you spend planning is a second you don't spend doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. New hires are explicitly told that Ramp prioritizes velocity, which can lead to some chaos, including shipping things that don't work or changing products without full enablement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. This is accepted as the trade-off for continuous innovation and value delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

Planning is streamlined:
*   Accuracy in planning is only increased for high-value activities, such as major market moments that require coordination across product, marketing, and sales (e.g., once or twice a quarter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.
*   Much of the R&D focus operates with high autonomy and less planning accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>.
*   Quarterly, month-long OKR planning cycles (which consumed 33% of time) were replaced by bi-annual, one-page company priorities, making the process smoother and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

### Thinking from First Principles
Ramp emphasizes thinking from first principles, especially because it operates in a unique business integrating credit cards (risk/underwriting), payments, and software (spend/expense management) for both SMBs (PLG) and Enterprise (sales-driven) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.

This means:
*   **Avoiding Pattern Matching**: Not relying solely on past experiences but delving into the fundamentals of what needs to be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.
*   **Hiring Thinkers**: Recruiting individuals who can set aside prior experience and think deeply from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Engineers, for instance, are expected to think through specifications deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.
*   **Support as a Product Function**: Support reports directly into the Product team, based on the first principle that "every support ticket is a failure of our product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. This holds the product team accountable for user experience and drives continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. Support agents are incentivized to decrease ticket volume rather than just resolve them, requiring a different type of hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

### Empowering Engineers and Designers
Ramp's ability to do "so much with so few Product Managers" (approx. 13 PMs for over 100 engineers) is achieved by:
*   **Distributing PM Responsibilities**: Forcing other team members, especially engineers and designers, to think like Product Managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.
*   **Product Operations Team**: A dedicated Product Operations team handles operational functions like project management, issue management, release management, enablement, content, beta programs, and customer research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.
*   **Eliminating Low-Leverage PM Work**: Product Managers do not write tickets or spend much time in ticket management systems. Their "contract" is the vision, priority, and a high-level specification, with the rest pushed to engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. This allows engineers to move faster by owning ticket breakdown and project accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>.

The core [[role_of_product_managers | Product Manager's job]] at Ramp involves:
*   **Team Building**: Creating a strong team culture within the autonomous pods, as engineers and designers often report to different functional managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.
*   **Focus Area Management**: Ensuring the team remains aligned on its key focus areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Shielding**: Protecting the core team from external stakeholders who might seek opinions, updates, or meetings, acting as the central point of contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

### Cultivating an A-Plus Team
Hiring A-plus engineers and designers is foundational to Ramp's success, even more so than product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. Key qualities looked for in engineers and designers include:
*   **Desire to Win**: A strong drive to outperform competitors and win the hearts and minds of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.
*   **Business Curiosity**: Understanding the business context, how the company makes money, customer feedback, and the importance of projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. They should proactively ask questions about the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.
*   **Autonomy and Proactiveness**: Ability to execute without constant oversight, setting their own pace, and proactively jumping into channels to help customers or fix bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.
*   **Accountability**: Taking ownership of their product's performance and addressing feedback directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.

In [[improving_product_management_skills | hiring]], Ramp prioritizes candidates with a strong desire to have impact and the ability to think deeply over sheer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. The best signal for a Product Manager is a desire to switch jobs because things "got too slow" or "too bureaucratic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>. To assess deep thinking, interviewers probe decisions and trade-offs made in past roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.

### Managing Chaos and Setting Expectations
Successful startups are often chaotic due to hypergrowth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. At Ramp, this chaos is managed by:
*   **Clear Strategy**: Despite fluid specifics, the core strategy, vision, problem, and value proposition remain consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
*   **Empowering the Tech Org**: The CEO sets the vision but trusts the empowered tech organization with the specifics of how to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   **Eliminating Meetings**: Meetings are seen as a major waste of time, especially status updates. Statuses are done asynchronously in systems, ideally in real-time, freeing up meetings for collaboration, ideation, and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
*   **Communicating Trade-offs**: Product leaders must clearly communicate the necessary trade-offs to achieve velocity, such as focusing on fewer, higher-impact initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This requires pushing back on requests for "everything under the sun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Leader Engagement**: Leaders commenting "this is awesome" on project channels or design critiques, and giving engineers opportunities to present, significantly amplifies the culture and motivates teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

## Strategies for Aspiring Product Managers
For those looking to break into product management, the advice is to gain experience in roles adjacent to product that offer deep understanding of customers and products, and allow demonstration of impact through their combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>. Examples include:
*   Product operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>
*   Business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>
*   Sales engineering or solution engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>
*   Designers and Engineers transitioning to PM roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>

Ramp sometimes gives high-performing individuals from these adjacent roles a 6-month trial in a new product area, with engineers and designers they work with determining if they'd prefer to have that person as their Product Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>.

The field of product management has experienced significant [[Trends and Challenges in Product Management | trends and challenges]], notably the overhiring of product roles during the pandemic and the proliferation of roles that resemble project management more than true product management. This phenomenon is often referred to as "product management theater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, where individuals in product titles are "dramatically overpaid for the value they provide because it's a project management role" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Rise of "Product Management Theater"

During the pandemic, many companies "over hired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> and, in some cases, "lowered the bar" for [[Hiring and roles in product management | product management roles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This led to an increase in what are described as "ridiculous roles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> within product teams, including agile coaches, product owners, product ops, and business analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These positions often perform tasks akin to project management rather than strategic product work, leading to a situation where "people that aren't real product managers" are acting in a "theater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

This issue is compounded by a number of factors:
*   **Financial Changes** The increased cost of funds has put pressure on companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Generative AI Impact** The predicted impact of generative AI creates uncertainty and has real implications for job roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Team Size Inflation** Especially outside Silicon Valley, team sizes have "gotten out of hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, with many companies realizing that "smaller teams can often produce more and better results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   **Remote Work Challenges** Velocity and innovation have "taken a real hit" with remote employees, leading to struggles for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

Many companies, particularly outside the Silicon Valley "bubble," have invested heavily in "extra roles" like agile coaches, scrum masters, and various types of project managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This leads to "epic waste" where "better companies do way more with a lot less" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

## Distinguishing Output vs. Outcomes: Feature Teams vs. Empowered Product Teams

A core [[Common problems faced by product teams | problem faced by product teams]] is the distinction between delivering "output" and "outcomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

*   **Feature Teams (Output-focused)**: On a feature team, individuals are typically given a "road map of output" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>, meaning features or projects to design, build, test, and deploy, often with specific dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. This is essentially a project management role, and in such setups, product managers are often not truly needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Engineers and designers may even prefer to manage the work themselves rather than deal with product managers who do not genuinely contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
*   **Empowered Product Teams (Outcome-focused)**: In contrast, an empowered product team is given "problems to solve" for customers or the business, with the measure of success being whether the problem is solved, not just shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. This approach focuses on "time to money" rather than just "time to market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

In an empowered product team, a product manager is essential because they are responsible for ensuring the solution is "valuable and viable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. This requires distinct skills that engineers and designers typically don't have, such as deep understanding of customers, data, compliance issues, sales, marketing, financial costs, monetization, and market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. A "real empowered product team product manager is a creator, not a facilitator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

## Why Project Management is Not Product Management

The core issue stems from a misunderstanding of the product manager's role:
*   **Project Owners** are often just "delivery team product owners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>, focused on administering a backlog in tools like Jira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. This is a "delivery process that has no business being a dedicated person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
*   **Feature Team Product Managers** do more than just backlog administration but perform "a lot of project management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. While project management is important, it is "not product management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.

In companies with true product management, the product manager has substantial work ensuring "value and viability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, which prevents them from having time to meddle in design or engineering tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

## The Impact of Misaligned Roles

The prevalence of project management-oriented product roles contributes to a general "dislike of PMs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. People's negative experiences with product managers often stem from interactions with those not performing a true product role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. This leads to companies, especially startups, initially deciding they "do not need product managers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:24">[01:15:24]</a>. While founders should initially handle the "value and viability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a> aspects, a real product manager becomes beneficial at a certain scale, such as with "20 to 25 engineers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>.

## The Challenge of Learning and Industry Advice

A significant [[Challenges and insights in product management | challenge for individuals]] aspiring to be true product managers is the overwhelming amount of online content and certifications that perpetuate the project management view of the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Many certification institutions propagate a "100% project manager" definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>, which is misleading. Well-meaning individuals in online communities often share advice based on their experiences in "crappy companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>, further entrenching the misconception.

To overcome this, individuals must "take more control of their career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a> and learn to "think critically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>, discerning good advice from bad. This includes researching potential managers and their backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. Individuals can also "raise their game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a> by focusing on value and viability skills, which can lead to appreciation and promotion within their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. This represents an opportunity to [[Building high agency in product management roles | build high agency in product management roles]].

## The Future and Vulnerability of These Roles

There is a "reckoning" underway for "delivery team product owners and feature team product managers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>, a [[Product management roles and overhiring | product management roles and overhiring]] issue that is only expected to be compounded by generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. If a role is fundamentally that of a "backlog administrator," it is "not a good job prospect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>.

Product Ops roles are also a topic of debate. While they can be valuable when focused on supporting user research and data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>, they can be problematic if interpreted as focusing on "process and governance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a> or used as a way to provide "product manager's assistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a> for tasks that true product managers should handle themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. Roles that are largely administrative or focused on "dirty work" are very vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:09">[01:14:09]</a>.

Companies are encouraged to take a "hard look at how they build products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a> and adopt a "product operating model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>. This model, consisting of 20 core principles, focuses on how companies decide what to work on, solve problems, and build/test/deploy products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. It emphasizes "empowered product teams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a> with "real ownership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>, supported by competent product managers, product designers, tech leads, and [[Challenges of product leadership | product leaders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. This shift is crucial for companies to thrive and ensure they are [[Building a successful product management team | building a successful product management team]] that delivers real value.

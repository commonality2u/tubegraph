In the evolving landscape of go-to-market strategies, [[productled_sales_strategies | Product-Led Sales (PLS)]] represents a significant shift from traditional sales models. The [[role_of_marketing_in_product_success | role of marketing]] within this new configuration is critical, though distinct from its conventional responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Traditional Sales vs. Product-Led Sales: A Shift in Collaboration

Traditionally, marketing's primary function in the sales world was to create pipeline for sales, with sales then selling the product and product engaging with the paid user for retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

In a [[productled_sales_strategies | Product-Led Sales]] environment, the [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | product]] takes on initial acquisition and activation of customers, and critically, the [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | product]] itself generates pipeline for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This means the relationship isn't a simple hand-off where [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | product]] merely throws features "across the fence" for marketing and sales to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Instead, the collaboration is deeply intertwined between [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | product]] and sales, with [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | product]] taking accountability over pipeline creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Why Marketing Cannot Lead PLS Alone
It is a "recipe for disaster" to attempt [[productled_sales_strategies | Product-Led Sales]] solely through marketing, as it will lead to failure within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This is because [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | product]] must assume accountability for selling the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Marketing's Crucial Contributions in PLS

Despite [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | product]]'s central role, marketing remains "crucial in the process" of [[productled_sales_strategies | Product-Led Sales]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

Key contributions include:
*   **Bridging the Gap and Education**
    *   Marketing helps bridge the gap between individual usage and an enterprise solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
    *   It educates end-users and enterprise buyers on the value proposition of the enterprise solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.
*   **Finding the Right Buyer**
    *   A significant portion of [[productled_sales_strategies | Product-Led Sales]] involves converting usage into a sales opportunity by identifying a buyer outside the immediate user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. Marketing is crucial here, connecting that decision maker to the existing product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
    *   While [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | product]] may qualify accounts (PQAs), there isn't always a [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | PQL]] (product qualified lead, i.e., a buyer) within the user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. This is where [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)]] become relevant, as marketing can bring that lead over and connect them with the usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.
    *   Marketing also caters to the third path: traditional top-down leads with no existing product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.
*   **Account-Based Marketing**
    *   Leveraging **Enterprise Marketing** and **Account-Based Marketing** is essential to find and attract the right buyer and link them with the existing product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.
*   **Sales Enablement**
    *   A strong [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product marketer]] can provide significant assistance with messaging, outreach, and [[productled_sales_strategies | sales enablement materials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>.

## Pitfalls to Avoid

*   **Excluding Marketing**: Leaving marketing out of the equation is a major pitfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>. Most product usage will not inherently have a buyer, necessitating marketing's involvement to find and connect that buyer with the usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>.
*   **Misaligned Reporting**: In a [[productled_sales_strategies | PLS]] model, [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | product]] and marketing should **share a pipeline creation goal**, as pipeline cannot be generated without marketing's educational efforts and buyer identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. This contrasts with traditional models where marketing and sales might have separate pipeline ownership.
*   **Same Internal Configuration**: Continuing with the same internal configuration where [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | product]] is a "feature factory" and marketing/sales drive monetization will hinder success in [[productled_sales_strategies | PLS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>.
*   **Ignoring User Journey**: Marketing efforts, particularly cold outbound emails, can become ineffective if they are not relevant or timely to the user's consideration journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Over-saturation of communication channels can lead to users ignoring messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[role_of_marketing_in_product_success | role of marketing]] in [[productled_sales_strategies | Product-Led Sales]] requires a shift from its traditional position. While [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | product]] takes on primary accountability for pipeline generation, marketing is indispensable for identifying and educating buyers, connecting them with product usage, and enabling the sales team with effective messaging and materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. Collaboration and shared goals between [[the_role_of_product_in_sales | product]], marketing, and sales are paramount for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

Uri Levine, co-founder of Waze and several other companies, has co-founded 10 different companies and served on the board of 20, building two "unicorns" including Waze, which was sold for over a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. He has also advised over 50 founders and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Levine authored the book *Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution: A Handbook for Entrepreneurs*, which Steve Wozniak described as a "Bible" for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. His work provides [[entrepreneurship_and_small_business_management | entrepreneurial mindset and leadership insights]] focusing on practical advice from ideation to company exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Fall in Love with the Problem
Levine's biggest lesson from his extensive experience is to "fall in love with the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This philosophy, which predates his book, serves as the "north star" for the entrepreneurial journey, minimizing deviation and making a startup's story more compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Problem-First Approach
The simplest way to create value in [[entrepreneurship_and_small_business_management | entrepreneurship]] is to solve a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This means starting with a big problem, something worth solving that would make the world a better place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

#### Validating the Problem
Once a problem is identified, it's crucial to speak with many people who experience it to understand their perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Levine suggests speaking with 20-100 people you don't know to validate if the problem is real and widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. If only you have the problem, he humorously recommends a therapist over building a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

> "If you happen to be the only person on the planet with this problem I can recommend you a therapist don't build a startup it's way more expensive and takes way longer period of time to build a startup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>

#### Passion for the Problem
Founders must be passionate about the problem they are solving, as the entrepreneurial journey is "hard and complex and long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Personal frustration can often be a source of compelling problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This personal passion is essential for the internal drive needed to overcome hardships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Once passionate, the goal is to engage others to fall in love with the same problem and follow your leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

#### Communicating the Problem
When communicating about a startup, focus on the "why" â€” the problem being solved or the value being created for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Avoid starting with "what" the company does or its technology, as this focuses on the solution rather than the user's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## The Entrepreneurial Journey: A Multi-Dimensional Path
The startup journey is characterized as a "multi-dimensional journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

### Rollercoaster of Ups and Downs
It's a "rollercoaster journey" with frequent, dramatic ups and downs, far more intense than in established businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Ben Horowitz's quote about sleeping like a baby ("I woke up every two hours and cried") accurately depicts this reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

### Journey of Failures
Building something new means constant experimentation and frequent failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Therefore:
*   **Don't be afraid to fail:** Fear of failure prevents trying new things, leading to pre-determined failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Fail fast:** Rapid failure allows for more attempts, increasing the likelihood of eventual success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. The goal is to be "good enough," not perfect, achieved through continuous iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### Long Journey
The journey is often much longer than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

#### Product-Market Fit
The longest part is typically figuring out [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth | Product-Market Fit]] (PMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. PMF means creating value for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Without it, a company will "die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

*   **Measuring PMF:** The single most important metric for PMF is retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. If users return, value is being created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. For high-frequency use products, a 3-month retention of 30-50% is a good indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
*   **Waze's PMF Journey:** Waze took four years to find its PMF globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>, iterating through user feedback because early global versions were "not good enough" outside of a few niche markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. For example, Waze's crowdsourced map data worked well in countries with simple house numbering but failed in Japan, where chronological house numbering required perfect data, which crowdsourcing couldn't guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.
*   **Value of Certainty:** For Waze, the ultimate value was not just avoiding traffic but creating certainty about arrival times, which users valued more than saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

## Startup Phases and Focus
Levine emphasizes the importance of focusing on "one thing at a time" in each startup phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.

*   **Phase 1: Product-Market Fit:** The initial focus must be on figuring out PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. During this phase, sales, business development, and even marketing are less critical; the priority is product development and iterating based on user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.
*   **Phase 2 & 3: Growth and Business Model:** Once PMF is achieved (the product doesn't fundamentally change for users), the company shifts focus to figuring out how to grow and its business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
    *   **Growth:** High frequency of use products often lead to organic [[strategies_for_effective_marketing_in_a_tech_startup | Word-of-Mouth growth]] (e.g., Waze) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. If frequency is low (e.g., annual tax returns), growth requires user acquisition, making the business model critical upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
    *   **Business Model:** Creating value guarantees a viable business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. Waze, for instance, started with the idea of selling map data and traffic information but pivoted to advertisement, a very different business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
*   **Pivoting:** Companies may start with one perception of the problem or market (e.g., B2C) and change to another (e.g., B2B) if initial assumptions prove harder than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Oversee, for example, pivoted from a B2C flight price monitoring service to a B2B solution for corporates to save 10% on travel budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

> "The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>

## Fundraising Strategies
Fundraising is a unique, often dark, "rollercoaster journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

*   **First Impressions:** Investors decide quickly, often "before they sit down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. Therefore, start your presentation with your strongest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>. This first slide will be displayed the longest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. Similarly, the last slide (e.g., "Thank You") is the second most displayed and should also be used to reiterate your strongest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.
*   **The Pitch:** For early-stage investors, the decision often comes down to "I like the CEO, I like the story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.
    *   The CEO should present alone to keep the "headlight" on them and avoid distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.
    *   Tell a good story that creates emotional engagement and makes the listener want to be part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
    *   Investors, as users themselves, need to feel the relevance and usability of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
    *   Authenticity comes through details in storytelling; use real user stories or craft detailed narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>.
*   **Expect Rejection:** Investors typically invest in only 1% of the companies they see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. Prepare for "100 times no until you hear one yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. Don't argue with a "no" as it's often a fixed decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.

## [[lessons_in_leadership_and_team_management | Hiring and Firing]]
The order of operations is "firing and hiring," as hard decisions about team members are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>. Many startups fail because "the team was not right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>, and often the CEO knew this within the first month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

### Making Hard Decisions
*   **CEO Responsibility:** In a small startup, hard decisions always fall to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>. Failure to make these decisions leads to top-performing people leaving, as they don't want to be in an organization that can't address issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.
*   **30-Day Rule:** Every time a new person is hired, mark your calendar for 30 days down the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Ask yourself: "Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>
    *   If "yes," tell them they're exceeding expectations, and consider giving them more equity to secure their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.
    *   If "no," fire them immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>. They are already on a path to being unsuccessful and causing damage to themselves and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.
*   **Seeking Confirmation:** To confirm difficult firing decisions, ask top-performing team members how they would feel if the person in question left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. Their response often provides the necessary confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. This echoes Netflix's "keeper test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
*   **Reference Checks:** When hiring, ask references: "Would you hire him/her?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a> This simple, direct question can elicit honest insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>.

## Understanding Users
Product builders often make the mistake of assuming users are like them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. Different people use products in different ways (e.g., using Waze by looking at the screen vs. listening to audio prompts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.

### User Adoption Groups
Users can be grouped by their ability to adapt to new behaviors (not just new technology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>:
1.  **Innovators (2%):** Use something new simply because it's new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.
2.  **Early Adopters:** Try a product if they perceive value and continue using it if it delivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>.
3.  **Early Majority (1/3 of population):** This group determines market leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>. They are afraid of change and complex solutions, preferring the status quo (e.g., "what's wrong with Excel?" for Salesforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.
    *   To reach the early majority, **simplicity** is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. This means iterating to add features that users need, then removing unused features that add complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.

### How to Understand Users
*   **Observe new users:** Watch what they actually do with your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>.
*   **Ask "Why?":** If users are not behaving as expected, ask them why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. This "why" is crucial for product success and iterative improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.
*   **Speak with Unsuccessful Users:** To improve, focus on users who failed in the "funnel of use" â€“ those who downloaded but didn't register, or registered but didn't use, or used but didn't return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. They possess critical information about where the product falls short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

## General Advice
*   **Life Motto:** "Don't be afraid to fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. Embracing failure leads to getting up stronger and encourages exploring beyond one's comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>.
*   **Continuous Re-evaluation:** For any aspect of life or career, ask yourself: "Knowing what I know today, would you do something different?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a> If the answer is yes, then act today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. Set timelines for re-evaluation, otherwise, changes may never happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solving:** Levine remains passionate about solving problems, including improving retirement savings (401k investments) and addressing inefficiencies in medical services and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>. Anything still done the same way as by previous generations likely needs to be revisited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>.

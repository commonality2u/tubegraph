The craft of product management is fundamentally about bringing **Clarity and Conviction** to the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

## Clarity

Clarity, in the context of product management, means transparency and simplicity of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. It involves sifting out distracting elements to reveal the core truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.

### Key Tools for Clarity

*   **Understanding the Problem**:
    *   **"Understand Work"**: Product Managers should actively use their own products (dogfooding) and competitor products (catfooding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. This means going through the entire user flow, including onboarding, to gain a visceral understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
    *   **"Top 10 Things You Should Know" Document**: A living Google document where each PM on a team lists their top 10 known problems with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. These problems can be qualitative, quantitative, or even relate to technical debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. This document is revised quarterly and aims to ensure everyone on the team, including engineering and design partners, is aligned on the core problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.
    *   **Engaging Stakeholders**: Involving stakeholders early in the strategy session by asking them to provide their "10 things you should know" (and stack-rank them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. This provides a multifaceted view of problems and fosters buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
*   **Narrative Framework**: Using an "insights, strategy, big rocks" framework to structure a product's purpose and plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[01:00:00]</a>. This is typically a two-page document written to explain why the product exists, what problems it solves, and the key initiatives to address them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. Big rocks should be limited to 3-5 key initiatives that, if delivered, significantly solve identified problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:45">[00:59:45]</a>. This document is evergreen and refreshed periodically, such as quarterly or semi-annually, to adjust to market changes and new problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.

## Conviction

Conviction is the feeling of what you believe the world should look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. It is not about certainty or perfection, but a strong sense of what is right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.

> "If you could put all the research into Bard or Chat GPT and it could spit out a PRD then you haven't done your job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.

### Cultivating Conviction

*   **Trust Your Gut**: [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | Product sense]] is a core competency of a PM and involves a feeling of what is right, refined by exposure to products and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. PMs should not discount their opinions or rely solely on data and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
*   **Pick a Lane**: Leaders will stress-test PMs by asking them to narrow down priorities, even if it causes discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. The discomfort indicates where more research or time should be spent to strengthen conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>. Avoid "peanut buttering" resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.
*   **Be a Decider**: Clarity comes from clearly defining who owns a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. An "informed captain" gathers context and input but ultimately makes the decision, fostering accountability and conviction within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.

## Developing a Product Vision

A [[product_management_career_advice | product vision]] is a picture of the future state of the world if a problem is solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. It's a long-term goal, often looking 3-5 years out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.

### Elements of a Good Vision

A strong vision has four key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>:
1.  **Lofty**: It should be inspiring and exciting, almost scary in its ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Realistic and Attainable**: While lofty, it shouldn't feel completely out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
3.  **Devoid of Current Limitations**: It should be imagined in a vacuum from today's technical or resource constraints, as these might change in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
4.  **Grounded in a Problem**: It must address a clear and potent problem that people are excited to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

> [!INFO] Vision vs. Mission
> *   **Vision**: The image of the destination; what the world looks like once the goal is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. (e.g., A world without parking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>)
> *   **Mission**: The purpose or "why" behind what a company or team does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>. (e.g., Make transportation reliable everywhere for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>)

### Three Steps to Develop and Communicate a Vision

Ab's framework for developing a vision follows three phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>:

#### 1. Empathize
This phase involves deeply understanding the customer and the problems they face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.
*   **Dogfooding and Catfooding**: Regularly use your own product and competitors' products to build intuition about what works well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>.
*   **"Top 10 Things You Should Know"**: Maintain a living document listing the top 10 problems users have with the product (including tech debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Input**: Gather problems and priorities from various stakeholders (e.g., marketing, operations, support, research) using the "10 things you should know" template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy Sessions**: Conduct multi-day strategy sessions (ideally 3 days) with core team leaders (product, engineering, design, research, data science) to immerse in insights and prioritize problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.

#### 2. Create
Once problems are clear, the next step is to visualize the world where those problems are solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. This is the vision itself.

*   **Mad Libs Framework**: A simple storytelling template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>:
    *   **Once Upon a Time**: Describe the initial state of the world before the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>.
    *   **[Problem Description]**: Detail the core problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.
    *   **Because of that [consequence]**: Explain the impact of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>.
    *   **One Day [Solution/Vision] Happened**: Introduce the major change or solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.
    *   **As a result, [New State of the World]**: Describe how the world changed and the impact made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>.
*   **"Backwards Working" Article**: Write a news article (e.g., TechCrunch, Verge) headline and subtitle as if the vision has come to pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. This forces clarity on the core impact and desired feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a>. The full article can be written later if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>.
*   **Visual Mocks/Sketches**: Draw or mock up the future state of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. This could be a detailed design mock, a sketch on a Post-it note, or even mock App Store screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:46">[01:54:46]</a>. Designers can help, but PMs should not use lack of design resources as an excuse to not visualize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:05">[01:27:05]</a>.

#### 3. Evangelize
A vision is useless if not widely understood and adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.

*   **Concentric Circles of Communication**:
    1.  **Core Team**: Ensure the immediate team understands and is bought into the vision first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:54">[01:43:54]</a>. Present it multiple times, allowing for questions and percolating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>.
    2.  **Stakeholders**: Share the vision with adjacent teams and their managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>. This helps address potential concerns and gain support.
    3.  **Leadership**: Present the vision to the highest possible leadership to gain amplification and alignment across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>.
*   **Living Document**: Document the vision and its supporting information (insights, strategy, big rocks) as an evergreen document with open comments for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:25">[01:45:25]</a>. This makes it accessible for onboarding and easy reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.
*   **Patience and Persistence**: Evangelizing a vision takes time (e.g., a year and a half) and will face naysayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:55">[01:29:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:09">[01:30:09]</a>. Persist through objections by having a clear problem and a vacuumed vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:23">[01:30:23]</a>.
*   **"How Might We" Questions**: Use fertile questions like "How might we..." to spark discussion and brainstorm solutions to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:25">[01:51:25]</a>.

## Culture's Impact on Product Building

[[building_a_successful_product_management_team | Company culture]] significantly shapes how product is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:36">[01:28:36]</a>. It's a living entity that evolves intentionally or unintentionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

*   **Uber's Culture**: Characterized by extreme ownership ("owner not a renter") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>, principal confrontation, and "toe-stepping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. This culture allowed for bold experimentation, such as introducing cash payments despite initial leadership opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. However, a monolithic culture that doesn't adapt can lead to public backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a>.
*   **Netflix's Culture**: Rooted in "no rules rules" and "freedom of responsibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a>. It encouraged structured debates and writing arguments, empowering individuals to make multi-million dollar decisions without extensive approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:56">[01:35:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. This intentional evolution allowed for significant product shifts, such as the introduction of advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:57">[01:39:57]</a>.
*   **Google's Culture**: Less explicitly defined ("you know it when you see it") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">[01:44:40]</a>, allowing for "microcultures" within different product areas (e.g., Search, Assistant, YouTube, Cloud) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>. This flexibility enables diverse product strategies (data-centric, human-focused, experimental) to coexist within the larger company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>.

### Building a Strong Team Culture

Within a product team, [[building_a_successful_product_management_team | product management culture]] is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:55">[01:58:55]</a>.
*   **Freedom of Responsibility**: Empower team members with freedom but hold them accountable for the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:34">[02:00:34]</a>.
*   **Informed Captain**: Clearly identify who is on the hook for decisions, ensuring one person is empowered to make the call after gathering context and input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:55">[02:00:55]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability as Strength**: Foster a culture where individuals feel comfortable showing up as their authentic selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:43">[02:01:43]</a>.
*   **Love, Not Liked**: Optimize for being loved by teammates, which means extending oneself for their spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This means having hard conversations and giving raw feedback when it's in their best interest, demonstrating genuine care for the person behind the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:35">[02:02:35]</a>.
*   **Human Connection**: Invest in knowing teammates personally, including their birthdays, work anniversaries, and career aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:35">[02:04:35]</a>. This builds strong bonds and mutual support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

The craft of product management is defined by the ability to provide clarity on problems and cultivate conviction in solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:58">[02:04:58]</a>. This involves deep empathy for users, strategic thinking, and the ability to articulate a compelling vision, all within a supportive and evolving team culture. Individuals looking to improve their [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | product management competencies]] should proactively "do product management" by analyzing apps, identifying problems, and sketching potential solutions to develop their product sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>.

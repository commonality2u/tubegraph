Effectively navigating difficult colleagues and personalities is a crucial skill for leaders. Anuka Gupta, Chief Product Officer at Rubrik and lecturer at Stanford University, shares insights on fostering alignment and managing challenging interactions.

## General Approach to Difficult Personalities
Anuka Gupta believes in the mindset that you can work with anyone, regardless of how challenging they may seem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>. The core of her approach involves deeply understanding what drives that person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:27">[03:38:27]</a>. This means identifying what they genuinely care about, whether it's the company's success or their own personal career and how they are perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:32">[03:38:32]</a>. Once you understand their motivations, you can tailor your approach to motivate them towards your shared goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:46">[03:38:46]</a>.

## Shifting Your Mindset
When faced with anger or frustration towards a difficult person, Anuka recommends shifting to a mindset of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:09">[03:39:09]</a>. This involves asking yourself what you can learn from them, even if you don't wish to adopt their personality or operating style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:21">[03:39:21]</a>. Every person has something to teach, whether it's their communication style, ability to rally people, or visionary ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:33">[03:39:33]</a>. By studying them and being curious, you can gain valuable insights, leading to a genuine feeling of generosity and gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:45">[03:39:45]</a>. This approach is linked to an [[leveraging_mindset_and_personal_growth_in_professional_settings|abundant mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:59">[03:39:59]</a>.

### Practical Steps for Understanding Motivations
To understand what someone wants, Anuka suggests talking to others who have successfully worked with them, such as their direct reports or peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:41">[03:40:41]</a>. This helps build a view of the person, fostering empathy and understanding their desired outcomes in various situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:03">[03:41:03]</a>.

## Giving Hard Feedback
Giving hard feedback effectively requires careful preparation and a compassionate approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:10">[03:47:10]</a>.
*   **Convey Care:** Explicitly state that you care about their success and want them to reach their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:25">[03:47:25]</a>. This setup, combined with positive body language, makes the recipient more receptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:43">[03:47:43]</a>.
*   **Be Direct:** Avoid passive-aggressive feedback. Clearly state what behaviors are being perceived or what is not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:57">[03:47:57]</a>.
*   **Provide Solutions:** Offer three actionable steps they can take to change perceptions or improve outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:07">[03:48:07]</a>.
*   **Preparation and Examples:** Prepare thoroughly before giving feedback, thinking about how to frame it to resonate without sounding accusatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:20">[03:48:20]</a>. Use personal examples of how you've handled similar situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:40">[03:48:40]</a>.
*   **Collaborate:** Brainstorm solutions with them, becoming part of the solution rather than just delivering the feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:49">[03:48:49]</a>.
*   **Tailor to Career Goals:** Start by asking about their career aspirations, as the feedback given to someone aiming for a CPO role will differ from that given to an individual contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:30">[03:49:30]</a>.
*   **Frame as Perception:** Use phrases like "this is how you're being perceived" rather than "you are doing X" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:14">[03:50:14]</a>. This acknowledges that their intention might differ from the outcome, opening a more constructive conversation about changing that perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:42">[03:50:42]</a>.

## Receiving Hard Feedback
Receiving hard feedback can evoke natural emotional responses like upset or defensiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:16">[03:42:16]</a>.
*   **Allow Emotions:** Let yourself feel the emotions that arise, without judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:35">[03:42:35]</a>.
*   **Delay Reaction:** Do not react immediately. Wait a few hours or days until the initial emotional wave passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:51">[03:42:51]</a>.
*   **Cultivate Curiosity:** Approach the feedback with curiosity, asking why it's being given and seeking more context from the person who provided it or from peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:58">[03:42:58]</a>.
*   **Assess Validity:** All feedback reflects someone's valid feelings, but not all feedback requires action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:28">[03:43:28]</a>. Anchor your decision on what is best for the company and what the company needs from you or your team at that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:37">[03:44:37]</a>. Distinguish between "must-haves" and "nice-to-haves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:47">[03:44:47]</a>.
*   **Encourage More Feedback:** By returning with curiosity, you signal that you are listening, which encourages others to continue providing valuable feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:47">[03:43:47]</a>.
*   **Journaling:** To build a positive mindset and process difficult emotions, Anuka recommends journaling. Writing down negative thoughts and exploring why you feel a certain way can help you break down abstract feelings and understand what is within your control or what needs to be discussed with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.

> [!INFO] Summary as a Tool for Alignment
> In situations involving diverse voices and potential conflict, effectively summarizing discussions can be perceived as strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. By synthesizing different viewpoints and checking for agreement, leaders can help [[improving_communication_skills_for_career_advancement|bring people together]] and move beyond conflict, ultimately leading to better insights and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. This is particularly useful in product management, where the goal is to get to the heart of a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. This can be done by verbally summarizing and ending with a question to invite further discussion or by writing summaries on a whiteboard or in a chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.

Uri Levine, co-founder of Waze and other companies, shares insights into fundraising, emphasizing the importance of storytelling and understanding investor psychology. Levine himself has co-founded 10 companies and been on the board of 20, building two unicorns, including Waze, which sold for over a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Waze specifically raised about $50 million throughout its entire journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

## The Fundraising Journey: A Rollercoaster in the Dark

Levine describes fundraising as a "roller coaster journey in the dark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. It's a different "ball game" than building a startup, and founders often don't know how to play it at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The Dance of 100 "Nos"
> Investors typically invest in only 1% of the companies they see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. This means a founder is likely to hear "no" 100 times before hearing one "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>. This high rejection rate can be very discouraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.

## Key Principles for Fundraising

### First Impressions Matter
Investors often decide if they like an entrepreneur "before they sit down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of making a strong first impression.

### Focus on the CEO and the Story
For early-stage investors, the primary reasons they decide to invest are that "I like the CEO" and "I like the story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>.

*   **CEO goes alone**: At early stages, the CEO should attend meetings alone to keep the "headlight" on them and avoid distractions from team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.
*   **[[the_role_of_storytelling_in_business | Tell a good story]]**: A good story is not about facts; it's about creating emotional engagement and making the listener want to be part of the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. For investors, this means they need to believe the product is "usable" and that the founder "can build it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

### Start with the Problem
Always start the pitch with the problem being solved, because investors are also users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. If the problem isn't relevant to them or they don't think they'd use the solution, they might dismiss it, concluding the market isn't there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.

*   **Lead with your strongest point**: Whether it's the size of the problem, traction, or the team, start with your strongest point because investors might have already made up their mind by the time you get to it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.
*   **Leverage the first slide**: The first slide of a presentation, often just a title slide, is displayed for the longest period of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. This is the ideal place to put your strongest point, such as the market size or the problem description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.
*   **Utilize the last slide**: The "Thank You" slide is the second longest displayed slide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. This is an opportunity to repeat your strongest point or share "one more story" that reinforces your message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. No one will interrupt you if you have "just one more story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.

### The Power of Authentic Storytelling
When telling a story, such as a user case, include many details to make it feel real and authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. If there are no details, the story might not seem real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. Stories don't necessarily have to be personal experiences, but they must be told with enough detail to sound authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] The Microwave Story
> Levine once advised a CEO who was pitching a gift card startup to tell a more compelling story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. Levine shared a detailed, five-minute story about returning a microwave that didn't fit, creating a relatable scenario that resonated with an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>. The CEO later used the same story, leading the investor to notice the consistency and find it "really funny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>. This highlights how details make a story authentic and memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>.

Raising capital for a startup is a unique and often challenging journey, described as a "roller coaster journey in the dark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Unlike building a product, fundraising happens multiple times throughout a company's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Investor Mindset

Investors make quick decisions; some venture capitalists decide if they like an entrepreneur even "before they sit down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This emphasizes the critical importance of first impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:03">[04:02:03]</a>.

For early-stage investments (when a company only has a story, no traction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, investors primarily decide based on two factors: "I like the CEO, I like the story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

### The CEO's Role in Pitching
To maximize impact, the CEO should attend meetings alone to keep the "headlight on me" and avoid distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. The CEO's goal is to tell a compelling story that creates "emotional engagement" and makes the listener want to be part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:03">[04:44:03]</a>. For investors, this means convincing them that the product is "usable" and that the team "can build it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

### The "Dance of the 100 Nos"
Investor conversion rates are typically very low, around 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. This means entrepreneurs will likely hear "100 times no until you hear one yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. This high rejection rate can be discouraging, but it's crucial to understand this reality from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Investors often provide excuses for not investing, such as "Google can do that in no time" or "the market is not big enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Arguing against these rejections is "useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

### Pitch Deck Structure
Most people miss the most important slides of their presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>:

*   **First Slide:** This slide, often a simple "Company XYZ Intro," is displayed for the longest period at the beginning of the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. It should feature the "strongest point" of the pitch, whether it's the market size, traction, or team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
*   **Last Slide:** Similarly, the final "Thank You" slide is the second longest displayed slide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. It's an opportunity to repeat the strongest point or tell "one more story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, recapping everything while the audience is still engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

### Storytelling and Problem Focus
A good story isn't just about facts; it's about creating emotional engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. This means starting the pitch with the problem the startup is solving, not the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Investors, like any other users, need to relate to the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. If they don't believe they would use the product or find the problem relevant, they may dismiss the idea, assuming the market isn't there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

Stories become authentic with details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. While stories don't always have to be real experiences, they must be told with enough detail to sound authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

### Financial Considerations
Waze, a unicorn company, famously raised only about $50 million throughout its entire journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. Israeli startups, in general, tend to be leaner than American startups, raising less money but often at lower valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

## [[lessons_from_failed_and_successful_investments | Lessons from Failed and Successful Investments]]

A key lesson from the startup journey is the importance of not being afraid to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Startups are inherently journeys of failures because they are attempting to build something new that no one has done before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. If you're afraid to fail, you've "already failed" because you won't try new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

### Fail Fast
When failures occur, it's crucial to "fail fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This approach allows ample time to make "more and more attempts" with different product versions, go-to-market strategies, or business models, thereby increasing the likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. The goal isn't perfection, but to be "good enough" through iterative improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

### The Importance of [[resilience_and_perseverance_in_startups | Resilience and Perseverance in Startups]]
The startup journey is long and filled with frequent ups and downs, described as a "rollercoaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This requires significant passion for the problem being solved, as lack of internal drive can hinder progress through hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. As a Japanese saying goes, "fall seven times and get up eight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

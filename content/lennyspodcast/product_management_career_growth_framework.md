VR Deman, Head of Product at Gojek, who oversees product management, design, program management, research, and insights teams across India, Singapore, and Indonesia, is highly regarded as a [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | product leader]] in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. He has a strong reputation for building robust product and design talent and helping people [[transitioning_into_product_management | transition into product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

## The Three W's: A Career Growth Framework

Drawing from over a decade and a half of working with strong [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product managers]], VR Deman developed a [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth framework for product managers]] comprised of three key areas, known as the "Three W's": What You Produce, What You Bring to the Table, and What's Your Operating Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. Strong [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product managers]] usually excel in two or three of these areas, but those who advance rapidly perform well across all three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

### 1. What You Produce: Outputs vs. Outcomes

When starting a [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_product_managers | career in product management]], the primary focus should be on outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Outputs are tangible deliverables like launching a product, analyzing experiments, or contributing to a go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. The advice for early-career [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product managers]] is to prioritize getting tasks done rather than obsessing over immediate impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

As comfort grows with outputs and working with stakeholders, the focus shifts to controlling *which* outputs are necessary, leading to outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. Outcomes involve owning product areas and goals, or collaborating on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Moving into leadership and strategic roles requires understanding which outcomes are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Don't forget your IC Roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>
> Even at senior levels, it's crucial to continue honing the craft of producing outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. This includes tasks like contributing to go-to-market strategies or creating product notes for marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. Occasionally, rolling up your sleeves and working on these things can build credibility with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. The role of a [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product manager]] is to be useful and make the team more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>.

### 2. What You Bring to the Table: Impact on Impact

This aspect refers to a [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product manager's]] "impact on impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>. It's not enough for a product area to be successful; one must demonstrate their contribution to that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. This means producing high-quality artifacts like Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), product notes, product strategy documents, and design briefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Importance of Artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>
> These artifacts are crucial for demonstrating progress across four pillars: data and metrics, design and research, technology skills, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. When [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product managers]] feel their [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth]] is stalled despite working on impactful areas, often the quality or completeness of these artifacts is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>.

Instead of bringing arguments or pushbacks, strong [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product managers]] channelize questions and inputs into strategic choices that shape discussions and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>.

### 3. What's Your Operating Model: Collaboration and Leadership

This is crucial for moving from mid-senior to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:00">[18:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. It encompasses communication, collaboration, organizational skills, and community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

Three tenets for working well with stakeholders:
1.  **Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>. This involves bringing the conversation to a logical space rather than an emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a>.
2.  **Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>.
3.  **Be in charge of getting decisions made, not making all decisions yourself** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>. As a [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | product leader]], it's vital to push back on bad ideas and ensure the team isn't working on "stupid" or likely-to-change tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>.

## Impediments to Career Growth

Three mindset shifts can hinder [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth]] for [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product managers]]:

1.  **Focusing on Controllable vs. Uncontrollable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:45:00">[27:45:00]</a>
    *   Early in a [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_product_managers | career]], individuals focus on what they can control, such as feedback and personal outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>.
    *   At mid-senior levels, conversations often shift to external factors ("Why is the organization not doing this for me?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a>.
    *   It's crucial to maintain focus on what is within one's control, particularly the "Three W's" framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>.

2.  **Relationship with Change** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02:00">[30:02:00]</a>
    *   When starting out, the rate of change and skill acquisition is high, leading to rapid [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>.
    *   At mid-senior levels, the rate of change can slow as individuals become hesitant to take on new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:00">[30:28:00]</a>.
    *   To counteract this, constantly seek ways to increase your rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>. Benchmark yourself against industry bests, not just internal peers, to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:56:00">[30:56:00]</a>.

3.  **How You See Yourself** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:00">[31:56:00]</a>
    *   Self-stories like "I am a very high agency PM" or "I am a very collaborative PM" can lead to anti-signaling, where one justifies shortcomings (e.g., being brash for "high agency" or indecisive for "hyper collaborative") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:00">[32:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>.
    *   These stories define behavior at a basic level, making them hard to correct with frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:10:00">[33:10:00]</a>.
    *   It's important to identify and correct these self-narratives, possibly by talking to trusted individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:24:00">[33:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:28:00">[33:28:00]</a>. Viewing oneself as a continuous learner is an enabling story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:51:00">[35:51:00]</a>.

## Key Attributes and Skills of Product Managers

[[Product_management_skills_and_best_practices | Product managers]] are evaluated on and must demonstrate proficiency in four pillars: data and metrics, design and research, technology, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. Additionally, three crucial "soft" skills are communication, collaboration, and organizational skills, along with community-building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:08:00">[52:08:00]</a>.

*   **Data and Metrics**: Ranging from defining basic product metrics to performing ninja-level data analysis for a potential data startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:38:00">[53:38:00]</a>.
*   **Design and Research**: From identifying user problems to tying them to business goals holistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:19:00">[54:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:31:00">[54:31:00]</a>.
*   **Technology**: From having no technical understanding to being able to write deep technology design documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:42:00">[54:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:05:00">[55:05:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: From relying on others for direction to articulating a coherent product strategy at a broad level, defining how to climb the "mountain" set by corporate or business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:19:00">[55:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:25:00">[56:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31:00">[56:31:00]</a>.
*   **Communication, Collaboration, Organizational Skills, and Community**: These are ongoing development areas throughout one's [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_product_managers | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>. A [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product manager]] acts as a community enabler, tying everyone together towards a common mission, especially in remote or distributed teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:26:00">[52:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[52:50:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Strategic Skill Development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>
> It's impossible to improve all areas simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>. Pick one area that offers maximum leverage for growth and focus on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>. For those [[transitioning_into_product_management | transitioning into product management]], it's recommended to pick one skill from data or tech, and one from design and research, to maximize leverage, especially if coming from a different background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[41:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:22:00">[41:22:00]</a>.

## Navigating the Ambiguity of the PM Role

The definition of [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product management]] remains ambiguous, with varied definitions across companies and even within large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:56:00">[46:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:20:00">[47:20:00]</a>. This confusion extends to other stakeholders who are unsure what to expect from a [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product manager]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:47:00">[47:47:00]</a>.

The general rule is: if something is blocking product progress, the [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product manager]] should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:06:00">[48:06:00]</a>. [[Product management]] is a discipline that improves with practice, like acting or dancing, combining both art and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:29:00">[48:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:03:00">[49:03:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The PM as the "Co-Collaborator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:00">[49:52:00]</a>
> A [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product manager]] is the only discipline that co-collaborates across all four core circles: strategy, technology, design, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:38:00">[49:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49:00">[49:49:00]</a>. This unique position provides insights no one else on the team possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:06:00">[50:06:00]</a>. It's about playing a role rather than being defined by a title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:20:00">[51:20:00]</a>.

## Contrarian Views

*   **Intent is not enough**: While good intent is important, actions, behavior, and communication must align to convey who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:13:00">[57:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:34:00">[57:34:00]</a>.
*   **Effort and hours are necessary for growth**: It has become "politically incorrect" to say, but putting in effort and hours is crucial for personal and [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth]], not just company success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:16:00">[58:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:38:00">[58:38:00]</a>.

## Final Thought

It's never too late to pursue what you want to do and be in your [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_product_managers | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

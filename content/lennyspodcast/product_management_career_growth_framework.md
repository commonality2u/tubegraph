VR Daemon, Head of Product at Gojek, is recognized as a leading [[product_management_insights | product leader]] in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He oversees product management, design, program management, research, and insights teams across India, Singapore, and Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Daemon has developed a [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | career growth framework for product managers]] to help individuals advance in their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Three W's Framework

Daemon's [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | career growth framework]] for product managers, known as the "Three W's," comprises three key areas:
1.  What you produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
2.  What you bring to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
3.  What's your operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

Strong [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | product managers]] excel in at least two or three of these areas, and those who experience rapid career growth perform well across all three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### 1. What You Produce: Outputs and Outcomes

Many people focus on impact, goals, direction, and strategy when considering their career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. However, early in a career, the primary focus should be on **outputs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Outputs** are tangible deliverables, such as launching a product, analyzing experiments, or contributing to a go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   This involves "just getting stuff out and done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, even if it's small contributions like ranking content sources for a homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   The goal for early-career PMs is to be useful, effective, and to ship products on time and bug-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   As proficiency in outputs grows, individuals move to **outcomes**, which are product area goals that can be owned or collaborated on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   Even at senior levels, it's crucial to maintain proficiency in outputs and not forget "IC roots," occasionally doing hands-on work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### 2. What You Bring to the Table: Impact on Impact

This aspect refers to a product manager's influence on the overall impact of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. It's not enough for a product area to be successful; the product manager must demonstrate their contribution to that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This is often demonstrated through the quality of product artifacts:
*   **PRD quality**: Are product requirement documents well-written and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>?
*   **Product notes**: Are notes for care teams and marketing clear and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>?
*   **Strategic alignment**: Is work derived from strategy rather than constantly pushing back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>?
*   **Metrics and data**: Proficiency in defining and working with North Stars, experiments, data, and metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

Daemon emphasizes the need for PMs to produce their own product artifacts, even when others (like strategy or design teams) create their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. This demonstrates progression in four key pillars: data and metrics, design and research, technology skills, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

### 3. What's Your Operating Model: Collaboration and Communication

This is considered the most crucial aspect for transitioning from mid-senior to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. It encompasses communication, collaboration, organizational skills, and community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Daemon outlines three tenets for working well with stakeholders:
1.  **Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>
2.  **Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>
3.  **Be in charge of getting decisions made, not making all the decisions yourself.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>

The "art of pushback" is crucial, ensuring that challenges are presented in a way that adds value and advances the product, rather than being perceived as an obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Shifting conversations from an emotional space to a logical one can be highly effective for successful pushback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

## Impediments to Career Growth

Daemon identifies three mindset shifts that can hinder a product manager's career progression:
1.  **Focusing on things beyond your control**: As PMs become more senior, they may shift focus from what they can do and learn to why the organization or stakeholders aren't meeting their expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. It's essential to continually focus on controllable elements within the Three W's framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
2.  **Relationship with change**: Early in a career, the rate of skill acquisition and growth is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. However, this rate can slow down at mid-senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. To maintain growth, PMs should constantly benchmark their skills against the best in the industry or other functions to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
3.  **How you see yourself**: The stories individuals tell themselves about their identity (e.g., "high [[building_high_agency_in_product_management_roles | high agency]] PM," "hyper-collaborative person") can unintentionally justify limiting behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Correcting these self-told stories, often with external feedback, is vital for resuming growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. A "learner" mindset is an enabling story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

## Key Product Management Competencies

Product managers are continuously evaluated on eight key axes, which can also serve as areas for targeted growth and development:
1.  **Data and Metrics**: Ability to define basic metrics, analyze experiments, and use data to derive insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. At an advanced level, this involves using data to inform strategic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
2.  **Design and Research**: Ability to identify user problems from a user perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>. At higher levels, connecting user problems to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
3.  **Technology Skills**: Understanding of underlying technology concepts like HTTP, API, and the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. Advanced PMs can engage in deep technical debates and write technology design documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
4.  **Strategy**: Ability to define "how to climb the mountain" once the "mountain" (corporate/business goal) is set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. This includes focusing on user segments, their needs, and the product development order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
5.  **Communication**: The ability to articulate clearly and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.
6.  **Collaboration**: Working effectively with diverse stakeholders and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.
7.  **Organizational Skills**: Managing tasks, processes, and ensuring smooth execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
8.  **Community**: Acting as a "community enabler" within the team and organization, fostering a shared mission, especially in remote or distributed teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

When improving, it's best to focus on one or two areas that offer maximum leverage, rather than trying to improve everything simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. For those transitioning into [[product_management_career_advice | product management]], it's recommended to pick one skill from data/tech and another from design/research to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

## Navigating the Ambiguity of the Product Manager Role

The role of a [[product_management_roles_and_overhiring | product manager]] is often ambiguous, with no single concrete definition, leading to confusion among PMs, their managers, and other stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. Daemon advises that if something is blocking product progress, the product manager should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.

Product management is both an "art" and a "science," with methodologies and frameworks helping to understand the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. Instead of focusing on defining the role, PMs should focus on their tangible contributions and how they impact the data, design, technology, and strategy axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>. A product manager's unique role is to be the "co-collaborator" and "only one who's pairing with everyone else" across these disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. The PM should aim to "Bram the team's overall contribution, overall energy, and overall output up, and not down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

## Contrarian Beliefs

1.  **Intent is not enough**: While good intentions are important, actions, behavior, and the way one communicates and collaborates are equally, if not more, crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>. What you do and how you do it matters as much as why you do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.
2.  **Effort and hours are necessary for growth**: It may be politically incorrect to say, but putting in significant effort and hours is strongly correlated with growth and skill improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. Personal growth requires consistent time, effort, and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>.

## General Advice for Product Managers

*   **Be open to feedback**: Treat feedback as a gift, listen to it, and act on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
*   **It's never too late**: Individuals can pursue and achieve their career goals at any stage of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

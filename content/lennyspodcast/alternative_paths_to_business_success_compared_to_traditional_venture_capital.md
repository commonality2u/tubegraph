Jason Fried, co-founder and CEO of 37signals (creators of Basecamp and Hey), champions an alternative approach to business success that diverges significantly from the conventional venture capital (VC) route. His philosophy emphasizes [[the_importance_of_bootstrapping_and_making_money_in_business | bootstrapping]], efficiency, and a long-term focus on profit and fulfillment rather than rapid growth and exit strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## The Case for Bootstrapping

Fried advocates for entrepreneurs to [[the_importance_of_bootstrapping_and_making_money_in_business | start bootstrapping]] because it provides continuous practice in the fundamental skill of making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This contrasts with the prevalent industry advice to "go big or go home" and raise substantial capital to achieve "unicorn status," a path which, according to Fried, "almost nobody makes it that way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

37signals, for example, operates without investors, a board, or plans to go public or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. The company has been profitable for 24 consecutive years, serving over 100,000 customers and generating tens of millions in annual profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This profit is distributed among founders and employees due to the absence of external investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>.

Fried argues that while venture capital might be necessary for businesses requiring significant capital expenditures (like manufacturing or restaurants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, it can actually hurt software businesses, which inherently have high margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. Venture funding often leads to inefficient spending on excessive hiring and customer acquisition, turning a potentially profitable business model into a less lucrative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

## Rethinking Growth and Size

Instead of being a "startup," 37signals aims to be a "stayup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Fried states that "staying is harder than starting," emphasizing longevity and resilience over initial rapid scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

Key tenets of this approach include:
*   **Efficiency over Growth**: 37signals focuses on efficiency, unlike competitors who prioritize growth and often employ thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
*   **Small Teams and Simplicity**: The company maintains a relatively small team of around 75 employees, while competitors have thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. This lean structure avoids enormous support costs and the complexity of catering to diverse enterprise needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. They offer a single price for Basecamp, with unlimited users, which allows them to build one tight, simple product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.
*   **Underdo the Competition**: Rather than outdoing competitors (which is expensive and defensive), the focus is on providing more simplicity and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:12]</a>.
*   **"Small is a Great Destination"**: Success isn't only about massive scale or unicorn status. There's ample room to build a successful business by focusing on smaller, sustainable models, serving what Fried calls the "fortune five million" rather than just the "fortune 500" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.

## Product Development Philosophy: Shape Up

37signals employs a unique development framework called "Shape Up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:07:00">[37:07:00]</a>. This methodology revolves around:
*   **Fixed Appetites, Not Estimates**: Instead of estimating how long a feature will take, they set a maximum "appetite" of six weeks. This budget forces them to find the simplest, most effective version of a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:56:00">[33:56:00]</a>.
*   **Small Teams for Projects**: Every feature is developed by a team of two: one programmer and one designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. This avoids large meetings, slow decision-making, and complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.
*   **No Long-Term Planning**: Fried emphasizes that "long-term business planning is a fantasy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:02:00">[38:02:00]</a>. The company re-evaluates its direction every six weeks, preferring to "do what I think not what I thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:26">[1:03:26]</a>.
*   **Cool Down Periods**: After each six-week development cycle, there's a two-week "cool down" period. This allows team members to work on minor improvements, fix bugs, or explore personal projects, preventing burnout from continuous "sprints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:00">[42:49:00]</a>. Projects that don't get done within the six-week appetite typically "die," preventing demoralizing long-running initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>.

## Decision Making: Gut, Instinct, and Feeling

Fried openly admits to making decisions based on intuition and gut feeling, considering every decision a "judgment call" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:23:00">[44:23:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond Data**: While data can be an input, it's never the sole or primary driver. Human judgment, experience, and the thousands of unquantifiable factors that influence decisions are valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:37:00">[44:37:00]</a>.
*   **Hiring for Taste and Instinct**: When hiring designers and product people, Fried seeks individuals with strong "taste" and "gut instincts" who can riff on ideas and demonstrate a deep understanding of what makes a product good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:08:00">[51:08:00]</a>. He probes into what they admire and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:16:00">[51:16:00]</a>.
*   **"How Does This Feel?"**: This question is central to their internal discussions, focusing on the human experience of products and designs rather than purely rational metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:02:00">[48:02:00]</a>.
*   **Play in Product Development**: Work is seen as "play," encouraging creative exploration and a spirit of innovation over rigid, process-driven approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:50:00">[54:50:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Learnings of the Alternative Path

While advocating for this path, Fried acknowledges its difficulties, especially for those starting with limited capital and personal obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>. His advice for those embarking on this journey is to:
*   **Stay as Small as Possible**: Control costs and maximize individual contribution before hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>.
*   **Avoid Complication**: Businesses tend to become complicated unless actively kept simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.
*   **Practice [[the_importance_of_bootstrapping_and_making_money_in_business | Making Money]]**: Bootstrapping forces entrepreneurs to hone the essential skill of profitability, which is often neglected in venture-backed companies focused on spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.
*   **Embrace [[negative_visualization | Negative Visualization]]**: Be at peace with the worst-case scenario. This mindset helps in moving forward despite potential failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a>.

Fried himself has [[approach_and_benefits_of_pivoting_in_startups | pivoted]] on major decisions, such as the company's focus. After years of concentrating solely on Basecamp, he realized a need to "make more things again," leading to the creation of the email service Hey.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

## The "Once" Initiative

A new endeavor for 37signals is "Once," a brand under which they will release non-SaaS software products, paid for once rather than through subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.
*   **Addressing Subscription Fatigue**: Fried believes there's a growing fatigue with recurring software fees, especially for core functionalities that don't change frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.
*   **Commodity Software**: They aim to create high-quality, simple, "generic" versions of common business software (like chat tools), which are currently priced at luxury rates despite being commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>.
*   **Relaunching Campfire**: The first product under "Once" will be a relaunch of Campfire, their original group chat tool from 2006 (predating Slack) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:48">[01:26:48]</a>. It will be a self-hosted, pay-once solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:43">[01:27:43]</a>.
*   **Open Code and Accessibility**: These products will provide users with the code, allowing for modification and customization. They are also designed with minimal text for global accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.

## Core Principles and Mindset

At the heart of Fried's approach is [[the_importance_of_bootstrapping_and_making_money_in_business | independence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>. Owning the business and having no external obligations allows for flexibility and the freedom to define success on one's own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.

Other guiding principles include:
*   **"Work Isn't War"**: Fried rejects common war metaphors in business (e.g., "target customers," "conquer markets"), finding them depressing and destructive. He prefers language that emphasizes creation, pride, and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **No Fixed Expectations**: When launching products, 37signals has no specific user or revenue targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>. The focus is on making products they are proud of and believe should exist, letting the market determine the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>.
*   **"No One Ever Went Broke Making a Profit"**: This simple quote from his father serves as a core guiding principle, emphasizing that profitability is the ultimate safeguard for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.
*   **Worry Less**: A personal motto that translates to business, encouraging resilience against anticipating future problems that often never materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:21">[01:44:21]</a>.

In essence, Jason Fried's approach offers a powerful alternative to the default path of venture capital-fueled growth, highlighting that true business success can be found in simplicity, profitability, independence, and a human-centered approach to work.

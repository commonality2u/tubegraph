In a world transitioning "after code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, the role of engineers is predicted to evolve significantly, driven by the advancements in [[ai_and_software_development | AI and software development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This shift will redefine valuable skills and the very nature of building software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.

## The Engineer as a Logic Designer
The goal with Cursor, an [[ai_and_software_development | AI code editor]], is to invent a new type of programming, a different way to build software that goes beyond traditional coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In this future, being an engineer will increasingly resemble being a "logic designer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The focus will shift from meticulously writing code in formal programming languages like TypeScript or Go to specifying intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

Instead of typing into a bot and asking it to build something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, engineers will describe their intent to the computer in the most concise way possible, defining how they believe the software should function and appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:10">[04:53:10]</a>. This means future software development will be "legions higher level and more productive," and potentially more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:10">[04:53:10]</a>. The shift will be gradual, moving away from current software development practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:10">[04:53:10]</a>.

### After Code: A Higher-Level Representation
The "after code" world is envisioned as one where the logic of software is represented in a more human-readable format, akin to English or an evolution of programming language towards pseudocode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:21">[07:01:21]</a>. This higher-level representation will be editable and easier to navigate, moving away from impenetrable millions of lines of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:21">[07:01:21]</a>. The human will remain in the driver's seat, maintaining significant control over all software aspects and having the ability to make rapid changes with a fast iteration loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:45">[08:11:45]</a>.

## Most Valuable Skills in an AI-Driven World
In this evolving landscape, certain skills will become increasingly valuable:

*   **Taste** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:30">[04:51:30]</a>: Beyond visual design (UI/UX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>, taste will extend to the logic of how software works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>. This means having the "right idea for what should be built" and the ability to effortlessly translate that vision—how it should work and look—into a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:31">[12:01:31]</a>. It's about focusing on the "what" rather than the "how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:39">[09:51:39]</a>.
*   **Reduced Carefulnes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:03">[10:27:03]</a>: Currently, carefulness is an incredibly important skill for software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:02">[10:30:02]</a>. However, as AI matures, engineers will be able to be less careful, shifting the emphasis more towards taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:02">[10:30:02]</a>.
*   **Understanding AI Capabilities and Limitations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:39">[46:39]</a>: Successful use of tools like Cursor requires understanding what AI models can and cannot do, including the complexity of tasks they can handle and how much information they require <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:39">[46:39]</a>. Users should experiment in a safe environment (e.g., side projects) to discover the limits of what AI can achieve, as many tend to underestimate its abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05">[48:05]</a>.
*   **Breaking Down Tasks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:28">[47:28]</a>: Instead of giving models a single, large task, it's more effective to "chop things up into bits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:28">[47:28]</a>. This involves specifying a little, getting a little work, and iteratively building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:28">[47:28]</a>.

## The Evolving Role of Engineers
Engineers will still be needed, and the demand for software is expected to be very lasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>. The shift will enable engineers to do "much more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>. The high cost and labor intensity of building relatively simple software today means that significantly reducing these barriers through AI could lead to a massive increase in the amount of software and tools created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>.

## Impact on Junior vs. Senior Engineers
Both junior and senior engineers benefit significantly from AI tools like Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. However, they tend to fall into different "anti-patterns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>:
*   **Junior engineers** may "go a little too wholesale relying on AI for everything," which is not yet feasible for complex professional tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.
*   **Senior engineers**, on average, tend to "underrate what AI can do for them and stick to their existing workflows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>. While some senior engineers, especially in developer experience teams, are at the forefront of adoption, the general tendency is underestimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

The ideal approach lies between these two extremes, characterized by "micro pessimism" or "bluntness" to cut through the noise and focus on building something truly great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.

## Staying Focused in a Rapidly Evolving Field
In the fast-paced world of [[future_expectations_and_development_trends_in_ai | AI and software development]], staying focused is crucial. Key strategies include:
*   **Hiring the Right People** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>: Seek individuals who are less focused on external validation and more on building high-quality work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. A "level-headed" disposition is important, where highs aren't too high and lows aren't too low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.
*   **Building an "Immune System"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>: Over time, companies in this space develop an ability to discern which new technologies and ideas truly matter amidst constant chatter and new launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.
*   **Continuous Innovation**: Given the high ceiling of what's possible with AI, companies must continuously innovate and build the best product to maintain competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.

The [[the_role_of_ai_in_software_development | role of AI in software development]] is a multi-decade technological shift, even more consequential than the internet or the advent of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. It requires solving both scientific problems related to AI models and user experience problems related to how humans will interact with and control these new capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.

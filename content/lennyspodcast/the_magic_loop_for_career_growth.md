The "Magic Loop" is a highly effective, five-step framework developed by Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon, executive coach, and course creator, designed to help individuals [[navigating_career_growth_and_advancement_in_tech | advance their careers]] in almost any circumstance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. It has proven to be incredibly popular, becoming one of the most-read posts on a prominent newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## What is the Magic Loop?

The Magic Loop is a simple yet powerful idea that helps individuals get promoted and [[navigating_career_growth_and_advancement_in_tech | advance in their career]] by forming a partnership with their leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Its core purpose is to help people find satisfaction in their careers, whether that means moving up, getting paid more, or changing what they're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### The Five Steps

1.  **Do Your Current Job Well** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>
    *   It's not possible to truly grow if you're not performing at a solid level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
    *   Your boss shouldn't wish you were different; you need to address any problems they perceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   A "good job" is often in the eyes of your manager, so ensure you understand their perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

2.  **Ask Your Boss How You Can Help** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
    *   Very few people proactively ask their manager, "What can I do to help you? What do you need?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   This act sets you apart and begins to build a relationship where you're seen as part of their organization's success, not just your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

3.  **Do Whatever They Say** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
    *   If you ask how to help and then refuse tasks you deem "unexciting" or "maintenance work," you undermine trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
    *   Help out, even if it's not your favorite work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

4.  **Align Your Goals with Their Needs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
    *   After helping a few times, approach your manager and say, "I'm really enjoying working with you. Is there some way I could help you that would also help me reach my goal?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   Clearly articulate your goal, whether it's changing roles, getting a raise, a [[navigating_career_growth_and_advancement_in_tech | promotion]], or learning a new skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   Managers tend to help those who help them, and they are generally open to meeting you halfway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

5.  **Repeat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>
    *   Once you're working with your manager towards your goal and discussing your path, simply continue the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This continuous cycle builds trust and mutual support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Why is it "Magic"?

The name "Magic Loop" came from the surprisingly effective results people experienced, with some feeling "in over their head" due to rapid career advancement and promotions, wishing they could "turn it off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It works in almost every circumstance, with very rare exceptions for truly exploitative managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Addressing Common Concerns

### "Why do I need to do this? Shouldn't my manager help me?"
While a good manager *should* offer feedback and opportunities, not all managers are good, or they may be too busy focusing on their own work and careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The Magic Loop is designed for those who don't know what to do or whose managers are less proactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. It puts the control of your career progression in your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

### Initiating the Loop as a Manager or Leader
[[Leadership and career advancement | Managers and leaders]] can also initiate the Magic Loop from their side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This involves asking employees about their career goals and proposing a partnership where they step up to new challenges in exchange for help reaching their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This win-win approach can lead to significant growth and success for both the employee and the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Real-world Examples

Ethan Evans shared stories of individuals who saw remarkable progress using the Magic Loop:

*   **Entry-Level Success:** One entry-level individual, initially struggling and made redundant (laid off) a year prior, applied the Magic Loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. They were offered a $30,000 raise and a bigger job, which they turned down for an even better offer from another company. This second company also promoted them, leading to a situation where they needed to "slow down and digest all of that" due to rapid advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   **From Engineer to Executive:** One of Ethan's best former colleagues at Amazon grew from a mid-level engineer (SDE2/Level 5) to an Executive Vice President at a major online bank over eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This individual progressed through senior engineer, small team management, senior manager, and ultimately director, running an office of several hundred people, before founding their own startup and then moving into an Executive VP role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This entire trajectory followed the principles of the Magic Loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Applicability and Advanced Mode

The Magic Loop is effective from the start of one's career well into senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. However, at very high levels (e.g., VP), the explicit conversation of "what can I help you with" becomes less necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

### Advanced Mode
As you progress, the "Magic Loop" evolves into an "advanced mode" where you move from asking your manager how you can help, to suggesting things that need to be done, to simply seeing what needs to be done and keeping your leader in the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. At the executive level, it's about being proactive and anticipating needs, then informing your leader of actions you've taken to fix problems or pursue opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This shift relies heavily on mutual trust and rapport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

## Why it Works So Well

The Magic Loop's effectiveness stems from two primary factors:

1.  **Rarity of Offered Help:** Managers are often overwhelmed and feel a heavy responsibility for everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Having an employee proactively offer help is rare and a huge relief, creating an allyship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
2.  **Social Engineering ("You Help Me, I'll Help You"):** It leverages human nature; people tend to help those who help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Instead of an oppositional relationship where employees try to do the minimum, the Magic Loop fosters a partnership based on mutual benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. This approach is for those who desire to [[navigating_career_growth_and_advancement_in_tech | grow their career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

The Magic Loop helps both you and your manager identify skill gaps needed for the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. It clarifies expectations, which are often vague in performance reviews, preventing misunderstandings about what is required for [[product_management_career_growth_framework | promotion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Crucially, it forces you to share your goals, as managers often make assumptions about your career aspirations (e.g., wanting to stay in an individual contributor role forever or assuming you want to be a manager like them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. Clarifying your goals removes this ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

The goal doesn't always have to be a [[product_management_career_growth_framework | promotion]]; it could be working on different projects, joining a higher-performing team, or rebalancing your work-life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. The Magic Loop can be adapted to help achieve any career goal, by creating a role where you add value appropriate to your level while doing work you enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

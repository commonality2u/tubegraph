In the early stages of a product management career, the primary focus should be on tangible [[the_importance_of_execution_over_strategy | execution]] and output, rather than solely on strategic impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This approach helps in building a strong foundation and demonstrates immediate value to the team and organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Focus on Output
When starting in product management, individuals should prioritize "just getting stuff out and done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The initial focus should be on outputs, which are tangibly defined actions that don't require extensive strategizing and allow for quick action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Examples of valuable outputs include:
*   Launching a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   Analyzing and running experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   Contributing to a go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   Sourcing content and ranking its feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   Preparing briefs, slides for leadership, or legal reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

Being "useful" is the core principle; make the team more effective and help the company succeed by actively contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Transition from Outputs to Outcomes
As a product manager gains comfort with producing outputs and working with various stakeholders, the focus can shift towards outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Outcomes involve owning or collaborating on product area goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. When transitioning, it's crucial to continue honing the craft of producing outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This includes maintaining strong product notes for marketing teams or ensuring thorough go-to-market strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Even at senior levels, product managers should not forget their [[maintaining_and_thriving_as_an_individual_contributor_in_product_management | individual contributor (IC)]] roots and occasionally "pull up your sleeves and go back and keep working on those things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Quality of Artifacts
A significant aspect of early career [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | growth]] is the quality of artifacts produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This refers to "what you bring to the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, meaning the direct contribution to the impact of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

This includes:
*   High-quality Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
*   Well-drafted product notes for various teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   Clear product strategy documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   Detailed briefs for design teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   Effective pre-iteration planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

When interviewing, candidates are evaluated on pillars such as data and metrics, design and research, technology skills, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. The best way to demonstrate proficiency in these areas on the job is through the quality of produced artifacts and documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

## Mindset for Early Career
A crucial piece of advice for [[tips_for_aspiring_product_managers | aspiring product managers]] is that early in their career, they have not yet "earned the right to inform strategy and vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. The expectation is to "get stuff done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

### Three Ws Framework for Career Growth
A framework for [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_product_managers | career growth]] comprises three "Ws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>:
1.  **What you produce** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>: Focus on delivering tangible outputs first, then managing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
2.  **What you bring to the table** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>: The quality and impact of the product artifacts you create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
3.  **What's your operating model** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>: How you communicate, collaborate, and manage organizational and community aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

Strong product managers who experience rapid [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth]] are proficient in at least two or all three of these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Pitfalls to Avoid
A common pitfall is focusing on things beyond one's control, such as overall corporate strategy or competitor actions, instead of concentrating on personal contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. For early career product managers, almost all work should be within their control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. It's vital to maintain focus on controllable aspects of the 3 Ws, including data, technology, communication, collaboration, design, research, strategy, and community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

Another pitfall is slowing down the "rate of change" in skill acquisition as one becomes mid-senior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. To maintain rapid growth, product managers should continually benchmark themselves against the best in the industry and other functions to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

## The Role of a Product Manager
The product manager's role is often ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. If something is blocking the progress on the product, a product manager should address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. Product management involves both "art" and "science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>; one can use the science (frameworks) to improve the art (practice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

A product manager is the "co-collaborator for all of these disciplines" (strategy, technology, design, data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>, tying everything together towards a common mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>. The role is unique because a product manager is the only one who pairs with everyone else, gaining unique insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

## Skills to Develop
Product managers are constantly evaluated on several skills. When picking areas for improvement, focus on what provides maximum leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

Key skill areas include:
*   **Data and Metrics**: From defining basic metrics to deep data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>.
*   **Design and Research**: Identifying user problems and tying them to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
*   **Technology Skills**: From understanding basic concepts like HTTP/API to writing technology design documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Defining how to achieve corporate/business goals through user segments, needs, and product roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.
*   **Communication**: Being able to convey information clearly and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Collaboration**: Working effectively with diverse stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.
*   **Organizational Skills**: Managing tasks and processes efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Community Skills**: Acting as a "community enabler" to tie the team together towards a common mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

For those [[transitioning_into_product_management | transitioning into product management]], especially from backgrounds like design and research, or data and tech, it's recommended to pick up skills in the complementary areas (e.g., a design background should focus on data or tech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. It's sometimes beneficial to progress slowly during transition to ensure foundational skills are well-developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

Ultimately, [[importance_of_communication_prioritization_and_execution_for_pms | output]] and [[the_importance_of_execution_over_strategy | execution]] are paramount for early career product managers, paving the way for greater strategic influence as they gain experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

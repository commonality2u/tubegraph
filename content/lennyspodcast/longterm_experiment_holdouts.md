Long-term experiment holdouts are a practice where a company continues to monitor the long-term impact of changes or experiments, often for months or years, even after the initial results are gathered and the winning variant is rolled out. Shopify employs this unique approach to assess the true value of their product changes and [[role_of_data_and_experimentation_in_growth | growth initiatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Shopify's Approach to Long-Term Holdouts

Shopify's strategy is heavily influenced by its [[longterm_vision_and_entrepreneurship | 100-year vision]] set by CEO Toby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. This long-term mindset allows them the luxury of evaluating the true, enduring impact of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

Instead of traditional metrics or KPIs for core product teams, decisions are made based on "taste and intuition" toward this [[longterm_vision and entrepreneurship | long-term vision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>. While the growth team does use some leading indicators for short-term experiments, the core accountability is to long-term effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>.

The growth team's primary optimization metric is the total Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) produced by a merchant cohort over several years (e.g., 1, 2, 3 years later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This differs from most companies that prioritize short-term retention or conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Shopify embraces the idea that most businesses will fail, but the few highly successful ones will make the entire cohort valuable, akin to an angel investing portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

#### Implementation of Holdouts
Shopify utilizes two layers of holdouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:59">[02:09:59]</a>:
1.  **General Holdouts**: A blanket 5% of users are held out from experiencing *every* change across the board for a quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:59">[02:09:59]</a>.
2.  **New Merchant Holdouts**: For changes affecting new merchants, a 50/50 split is run for a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. The winning variant is then shipped to 100% of new merchants, but the original cohort assigned to the experiment is continuously monitored for years (e.g., a year, two years, three years later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:55">[02:19:55]</a>.
    *   This allows them to ship quickly while maintaining accountability for long-term results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
    *   Their internal experimentation tools automatically send email updates to experimenters at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, detailing the updated results of their cohorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:55">[02:19:55]</a>.

The key metrics tracked for long-term impact are total GMV and gross profit from the cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. They use cohort GMV curves, rather than typical retention curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The focus is on the *absolute number* of successful merchants and total GMV generated, not conversion rates, to prevent teams from locally optimizing by making upstream steps harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

### Surprising Findings from Long-Term Holdouts
This long-term perspective has revealed several counter-intuitive insights:

*   **Short-Term Lift Often Doesn't Last**: A significant portion (30-40%) of experiments that showed a short-term lift (e.g., in paying shops or first sales) yielded no incremental long-term lift on GMV after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. This often occurs because the short-term lift merely "pulls forward" success that would have happened anyway or attracts incremental users who are not truly valuable long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Example: Payment Failure Notifications**: Improving notifications for failed payments initially showed a major lift in short-term conversions. However, a year later, there was no long-term GMV lift. This indicated that users whose payments failed were likely less dedicated entrepreneurs, and the notification simply brought forward a payment that would have happened, or they still weren't committed enough to be long-term valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This highlights the dangers of [[ineffective_growth_tactics | ineffective growth tactics]] focused solely on short-term metrics.

*   **Neutral Short-Term Can Be Long-Term Positive**: Conversely, some experiments showing neutral or no short-term lift proved to have a massive impact on GMV after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Example: Pre-configured Online Store Sections**: Testing pre-configured sections and blocks for online store editors (e.g., an image, text banner, product collage) initially showed no lift in converting users to paying merchants. However, six months later, it had a substantial positive impact on the number of people selling and producing GMV. This was because it helped users create better, higher-converting stores, leading to early sales, momentum, and continued entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
    *   Shopify is willing to ship "neutral" experiments if there's a strong intuition that they are beneficial for merchants, as these might reveal hidden long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

*   **Unlocking Valuable Merchants**: Long-term holdouts can uncover "pockets of merchants" that are extremely valuable, who might have been missed by normal short-term measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
    *   **Example: Reducing Monetary Friction**: Lowering barriers related to monetary friction (e.g., extended trial lengths, incentives like app store credits, or temporary price reductions) might initially seem to attract "lower quality" users due to the association of discounts with lower quality. However, long-term analysis showed that these changes causally enable a class of entrepreneurs to succeed by giving them more time and opportunity to try their idea or move their business to Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. This suggests that [[freemium_vs_trial_models | trial models]] and pricing strategies can have nuanced long-term effects.

### General Advice for Others
For companies that cannot run multi-year holdout experiments, Archie Abrams advises:
*   **Be Specific with Early Indicators**: Identify and instrument early signs of success in your product and track downstream metrics as deeply and for as long as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Ship If There's Short-Term Lift**: If an experiment shows a short-term lift, it's generally safe to ship it as it's unlikely to harm the business, even if it doesn't provide significant long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Overestimate Impact**: Be realistic about the amount of long-term impact that short-term wins are truly having <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. It is probably more common than people realize that short-term lifts do not translate into long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

This commitment to long-term evaluation and accountability has allowed Shopify to continuously refine its understanding of what truly drives value and avoid the "shiny object trap" of short-term metric optimization.

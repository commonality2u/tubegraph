Ros Herberg serves as the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) and VP of Product Strategy at Wiz, one of the world's fastest-growing security and software companies [01:13:58]. Wiz achieved 100 million ARR just 18 months after its founding [01:39:27] and is rumored to have explored an acquisition by Google for over $23 billion within five years of its establishment [01:43:08]. Ros's journey to CMO is non-traditional, having started as an engineer and then spending most of her career as a product manager [01:18:29].

## Background: Wiz's Rapid Growth and Initial Challenges

Wiz was founded just under five years ago [03:04:47], during March when the world shut down due to the pandemic [08:07:07]. Ros was one of the first 10 employees [00:00:00] and the first product manager [00:00:01]. Initially, the founders did not have a clear idea figured out [00:05:07]. The company was officially founded as "Beyond Networks," with an initial focus on network security, despite the team's background in cloud security products [07:33:63].

In the early weeks, the team held 10 to 15 meetings daily with potential B2B customers, typically Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) [08:22:15]. At this stage, they only had an idea and a deck to explain it, not a solid product [08:40:08]. Ros, as the product manager, found it confusing because she didn't exactly understand what they were going to build [00:26:07]. She felt the customers' feedback was polite but lacked deep enthusiasm, often concluding calls with "Oh, sounds interesting" [09:16:35]. This led her to realize that the initial idea wasn't working and prompted a pivotal discussion, leading to a shift to cloud security [00:34:64].

Once they pivoted to cloud security, the conversations changed dramatically [18:37:37]. Customers began asking about pricing, purchase orders (POs), and connecting them to their teams [13:21:64]. Ros realized that customers were pushing for the next steps and demonstrating real passion [14:24:26]. This demonstrated clear product-market fit [02:00:19].

## Transition to Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)

Ros's move to marketing from a [[challenges_of_transitioning_to_management_roles | product management]] background was unexpected, and she initially thought it was "bizarre" [02:50:80]. She had no prior experience in marketing, didn't know terms like "lead" or "pipeline," and had never been part of the go-to-market side [02:22:92]. However, she chose to "follow good people" and pursue opportunities [02:40:48].

After two and a half years at Wiz, despite clear product-market fit and a functioning sales team, marketing was still a challenge [02:54:33]. Customers were signing with competitors because they hadn't heard of Wiz in time [02:14:48]. This highlighted a crucial need for awareness and brand building to support the company's [[company_growth_and_scaling_challenges | scaling challenges]] [02:56:88]. Ros recognized that at a certain point of a product's maturity, brand significantly influences purchasing decisions, even for complex B2B products [02:25:28].

Her decision was to give the role a try, believing that if asked to attempt, she should [02:51:75]. This exemplifies her comfort with being "pretty sure I'm going to fail at something and still attempting it" [00:41:19].

## Challenges and Philosophy of the CMO Role

### Building Trust and Understanding
Ros believes the CMO role is inherently difficult, particularly without deep trust and connection to the founding team [03:19:64]. Marketing activities are highly visible, and misrepresenting the company's brand can quickly erode trust [03:33:04]. For a technical company like Wiz, a CMO needs a strong understanding of the product and its market, which is challenging to gain from an external perspective [03:35:86]. Ros's background in security and product gave her an inherent understanding of their audience and the problems they solved [03:22:20].

### Marketing vs. Product Mentality
Ros realized that marketing operates with a fundamentally different philosophy than [[challenges_in_product_management | product development]]. As a product manager, "less is more" [03:47:33], and adding a feature has a significant, often irreversible, cost (engineering time, product complexity) [03:52:95]. In contrast, marketing allows for rapid experimentation and iteration without long-term technical debt or maintenance [03:42:32]. A failed marketing campaign can be forgotten the next day [03:54:19]. This insight led her to embrace trying "everything" to make noise [03:07:05].

### The "Dummy Explanation" and Clear Communication
One of Ros's key learnings was the importance of clear, simple communication [04:55:04]. When a company scales, messages can get lost in translation if they are "fluffy or blurry or gray" [04:06:55]. She stresses the need for "crystal clear, black and white" communication that doesn't assume deep knowledge about the product or market [04:26:07]. For example, internal terminology like "CNAPP" (Cloud Native Application Protection) might not be what customers are searching for (e.g., "cloud security solution") [04:47:50]. This constant reminder to avoid the "Wiz bubble" and speak plainly is a daily practice [05:06:40].

### Embracing Failure and Taking Risks
Ros attributes her willingness to take risks and be "okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail" to her upbringing [00:40:40]. Her mother encouraged her to focus on areas where she was less confident, promoting the idea that "friction is good" [04:35:57]. This philosophy allows her to attempt challenging roles and initiatives, even when she feels like an imposter [00:41:13].

An example of this risk-taking was the Wiz booth at the RSA conference, a major cybersecurity event [03:11:47]. Instead of a traditional cyber booth (red, black, hoodies), Ros decided to create a "Wiz of Oz" themed booth with actors like Dorothy, which was completely opposite to typical industry displays [03:54:83]. Her goal was simply to make people stop and ask, "What is Wiz?" [03:43:08]. This unconventional approach, initially scary, led to five times more visitors than the previous year, with the same investment [04:04:36]. This success inspired other cyber companies to adopt themed booths [04:24:06]. Ros also decided to rebrand Wiz with a very positive, optimistic brand focusing on pink, bright blue, and "magic" rather than fear [03:16:34]. This demonstrates the [[role_and_impact_of_rebranding_on_company_growth | impact of rebranding on company growth]].

### Company Culture and Influence
Ros highlights the unique culture at Wiz, fostered by its four co-founders who have worked together for over two decades [05:17:40]. They operate with complete trust and clear domains, allowing for fast decision-making [05:21:05]. The company has a flat and open culture, where employees are empowered to drive impact regardless of title or experience [05:22:92]. This environment made it possible for Ros to voice her initial confusion about the product and later to take on the CMO role despite lacking traditional marketing experience [01:51:75]. This culture of trust and opportunity also fosters significant employee loyalty [05:31:05].

## Key Takeaways
*   **Customer Feedback**: Beyond polite interest, look for "deep enthusiasm" and customers pushing for next steps (e.g., asking about pricing, POVs, connecting to teams) [11:16:20].
*   **High Volume of Interactions**: Doing many customer calls (10-15 a day) is crucial for discovering what isn't working and finding what is [01:36:26].
*   **Founders as First Salespeople**: Founders should try to sell the product themselves in the early stages to deeply understand the market and build confidence, even if they're not natural salespeople [02:12:44].
*   **"Follow the Heat"**: The area of greatest need or opportunity ("heat") shifts as a company growsâ€”from product, to engineering, to sales, and eventually to marketing [02:29:41].
*   **Embrace Vulnerability**: Don't be afraid to say "I don't understand" [01:51:75]. If something isn't simple, it needs more thought [01:36:11].
*   **Marketing as Experimentation**: Unlike product, marketing allows for frequent experimentation and iteration without significant long-term costs [03:42:32].
*   **Crystal Clear Messaging**: As a company scales, product teams must deliver extremely clear, jargon-free messages for the go-to-market teams to amplify effectively [04:25:28].
*   **Embrace Imposter Syndrome**: Accept that you might feel like an imposter in new roles and use that mindset as motivation to try, rather than letting it stop you [04:41:13].

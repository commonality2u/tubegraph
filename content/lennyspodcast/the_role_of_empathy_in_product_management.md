Nonan You, Head of Product at Linear, emphasizes the critical role of [[empathydriven_storytelling | empathy]] in product development, particularly for B2B SaaS products that aim to be beloved by their users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:05">[01:28:05]</a>. Linear, a B2B SaaS product, has achieved significant user admiration and rapid growth due to its focus on user experience and understanding user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>.

## Understanding User Emotions
Nonan's approach to [[developing_user_empathy_and_gathering_insights_for_product_development | customer insights]] involves deep [[developing_user_empathy_and_gathering_insights_for_product_development | digging]] into customer problems to uncover the underlying emotions driving their requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:56">[03:07:56]</a>. His goal is to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:06">[03:11:06]</a>. This approach helps to move beyond surface-level requests and understand the emotional "valence" motivating a user's desire for a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:57">[03:50:57]</a>. This means going beyond analytical frameworks like "five whys" or "jobs to be done" to truly grasp the user's emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:08">[03:24:08]</a>.

> "My goal is to feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:06">[03:11:06]</a>

This deep understanding helps to identify core problems that, if solved, can alleviate negative feelings for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:05">[03:47:05]</a>.

## Empathy in Action: Solving Real Problems

### Prioritizing Individual Contributors (ICs)
A key application of empathy at Linear is the prioritization of individual contributors (ICs) over middle managers when considering feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:04">[03:57:04]</a>. Linear frequently rejects customization features requested by middle managers for reporting purposes, as these often come at the cost of making IC workflows worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. This policy directly addresses the "bloatedness" that makes ICs "kind of hate their lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

Nonan highlights that when ICs feel disengaged due to cumbersome tools, their data input becomes unreliable, rendering reports inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. By prioritizing the IC's experience, Linear ensures that the core users remain engaged, leading to more accurate data and ultimately more effective teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>. The focus is on where incentives are misaligned among the user base, specifically between what a middle manager desires for reporting and what an IC wants for an efficient workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:21">[04:01:21]</a>.

### Targeted Feature Development
Empathy also guides the development of specific features by linking back to real people and their specific workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>. Instead of building general solutions based on aggregated requests, Linear seeks to understand a specific person's workflow and how a feature would truly benefit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>.

*   **Customer Requests Feature:** Linear's "customer requests" feature emerged from understanding that a significant portion of "custom field" requests were driven by the need to track features for specific large customers like "Walmart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:07">[02:57:07]</a>. By automating the tagging of requests from integrated customer support and CRM tools, Linear eliminated the manual burden on ICs while still providing the necessary reporting for managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:04">[03:33:04]</a>. This made ICs feel more confident, as they understood who was asking for features and the context of the requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:04">[03:55:04]</a>.
*   **Flexible Due Dates:** An example of a user feeling "bad" was a [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | PM]] who marked a project with a specific ship date (e.g., December 30th) that caused issues with the marketing team because everyone was on vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:52">[03:22:52]</a>. This specific pain point led to a feature allowing users to set flexible target dates (e.g., "Q4 project," "second half of 2024 project"), eliminating the stress of false precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:09">[03:38:09]</a>.
*   **Triage Management:** The "triage management" feature addressed the frustration of teams feeling "underwater" from manually routing tickets or feeling "out of control" when tickets were "thrown over the wall" with no clear process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:26">[03:36:26]</a>. By systematizing this, Linear automated an organized way to handle triage queues, removing the bad feelings of being overwhelmed or ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>.

## Overcoming "Schlep Blindness"
[[Key Skills for Product Managers | Product Managers]] and engineers can be "thinky people" who avoid "touchy-feely stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:08">[03:27:08]</a>. This can lead to "schlep blindness," a term coined by Paul Graham, where individuals are blind to their own daily frustrations or tedious tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:04">[03:55:04]</a>. By observing where users "feel bad" throughout their workday, even when they don't explicitly articulate it, product teams can identify untapped opportunities for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:26">[03:36:26]</a>.

## Building a Mental Model of the User
[[Developing user empathy and gathering insights for product development | Empathy]] contributes to building a robust mental model of the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. This model is continuously informed by research, data, and direct conversations with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:50">[04:06:50]</a>. Linear maintains a backlog of product opportunities that are not yet "ready" but are continuously refined through understanding user behavior, ensuring that new features truly align with real-world needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

This commitment to [[developing_user_empathy_and_gathering_insights_for_product_development | empathy]] helps Linear create a product that is not just functional but also deeply appreciated by its users, enabling them to "feel less bad, less often" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:02">[03:54:02]</a>.

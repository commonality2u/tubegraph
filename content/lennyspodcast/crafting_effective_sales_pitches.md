In the realm of B2B sales, a significant challenge arises from buyer indecision, with 40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes ending in no decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The majority of these "no decisions" aren't because the old solution is better, but because buyers struggle to make a confident choice, often opting to delay the decision as the safest, risk-free option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This highlights a critical need for a more effective sales approach.

April Dunford, a renowned authority on product positioning and author of *Obviously Awesome*, published her new book, *Sales Pitch*, which guides on how to better pitch and sell products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Her framework aims to excite potential customers and drive purchasing decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## The Problem with Traditional Pitches

Historically, many sales pitches, especially in SaaS companies, function as "product expositions" â€“ a glorified product walkthrough that focuses on features rather than value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This approach often leaves customers confused about why they should choose one product over alternatives, as it doesn't clearly [[differentiating_messaging_for_effective_sales | differentiate messaging for effective sales]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

B2B buyers, despite doing their own research, often lack a clear understanding of the market, including different approaches to a problem, where products fit, and effective purchase criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. They are often first-time buyers of software like yours and are concerned about making a bad choice that could impact their job or department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. This stress leads to indecision, with buyers fearing "screwing up" more than "missing out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. Throwing "fear of missing out" (FOMO) into the mix actually makes indecisive customers *less* likely to close a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.

## April Dunford's Sales Pitch Framework

The framework emphasizes a "teaching mindset" rather than simply showcasing features, building trust by providing a broader understanding of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. The pitch structure is divided into two main parts: **Setup** and **Follow-Through** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Part 1: The Setup

The setup phase focuses on the market and your point of view, serving as a discovery process where conversation with the client is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. It typically takes only a few minutes in a half-hour call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

1.  **Insight:** Start with your unique insight into the market or the "problem inside the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This should resonate with your target account and is generally not controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
    *   *Example (Help Scout):* Digital businesses view customer service as a growth driver, not a cost center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
2.  **Alternatives (Pluses and Minuses):** Paint a picture of the entire market, discussing the pros and cons of existing alternative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. This helps the buyer understand the landscape and feel good about their choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
    *   *Example (Help Scout):* Compare shared inboxes (easy, but outgrown) with traditional help desk software (hard to use, cost-focused) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
3.  **Perfect World (Conclusion):** Lead the customer to agree on what a "really good solution" would look like, aligning their worldview with yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. If they agree to your definition of a perfect world, you've essentially won the deal before even discussing your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>.

### Part 2: The Follow-Through

This part focuses on your [[differentiating_messaging_for_effective_sales | differentiated value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

1.  **Product Introduction:** Briefly introduce your product and its market category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.
    *   *Example (Help Scout):* "We're Help Scout, customer service software for digital businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>.
2.  **[[differentiating_messaging_for_effective_sales | Differentiated Value]]:** Demonstrate how your product delivers the "perfect world" characteristics discussed earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. This means showing the value that your unique features provide, which competitors cannot deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. This is where most of the sales call time should be spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>.
    *   *Example (Help Scout):* Show how it's easy to use like an inbox, has features to avoid outgrowing it, and delivers an amazing customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
    *   *Example (LevelJump, a sales enablement company):* Built on Salesforce, uniquely integrating sales enablement data with sales data, which allows measuring impact on time to first deal and quota attainment, leading to faster revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
3.  **Proof:** Provide evidence that you can deliver the claimed value, such as customer case studies or independent third-party verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>.
4.  **Objections (Optional):** Proactively address potential unspoken objections (e.g., cost, adoption difficulty, security concerns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. In B2B, a "champion" buyer needs to be armed to handle objections from 5-7 other stakeholders involved in the purchase process, as these stakeholders can kill a deal even if they can't make it happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Companies with enough traction will already know common objections and can prepare the champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.
5.  **The Ask:** Clearly state the desired next step in the sales process, whether it's asking for the sale, proposing a proof of concept, or defining a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>.

## Implementation and Impact

This framework is useful for B2B products with a sales team, even if the [[founderled_sales_strategies | founder is the only sales rep]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. It requires enough market traction to understand how a deal typically progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.

### Cross-functional Collaboration
A core element of a good sales pitch is a deep understanding of your [[differentiating_messaging_for_effective_sales | differentiated value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. This requires a cross-functional team, including product, marketing, and sales, to work together on defining positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. This ensures that the product team's understanding of value translates effectively to the sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. Marketing often acts as the "stewards of positioning" and "positioning police" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

### Testing and Rollout
*   **Pilot:** Train your *best* sales rep on the new pitch. They should pitch it to you and the head of sales for repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.
*   **Test with Qualified Prospects:** The rep should test the new pitch with qualified prospects, not existing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.
*   **Iterate:** After each pitch, huddle to discuss what worked and what didn't, making adjustments to the wording or slide order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.
*   **Internal Evangelism:** Once the best rep feels the new pitch is superior and won't go back to the old one, they can train and convince the rest of the sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. This internal sales-teaching-sales approach is more effective than marketing dictating the pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>.

### Timelines and Results
Refining positioning can take about a week, and rolling out a new pitch can be done in about a month for most companies, with some achieving it in as little as two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>. This approach can lead to an immediate uplift in sales metrics, often doubling the number of deals converting from a first sales call to an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. This is considered "low hanging fruit" to improve pipeline conversion, especially in challenging economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

## Contrasting with Other Sales Approaches

Dunford's framework differs from approaches that start with a broad market trend (like Andy Raskin's "The Shift") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.

*   **Differentiated Value vs. "New is Inherently Valuable":** Some frameworks assume "new is inherently valuable and old is inherently bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>. However, customers are often comfortable with the old, and it's less risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. The core of Dunford's pitch is showing specific [[differentiating_messaging_for_effective_sales | differentiated value]] that customers can't get elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>.
*   **Trends vs. Insights:** Starting with a broad trend might not be unique to your company, as competitors see the same trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on your unique insight into the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.
*   **Sales Pitch vs. [[insights_on_fundraising_and_pitching_to_investors | Investor Pitch]]:** While a trend-based approach can work for investor pitches where longer timelines and market disruption are discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>, a sales pitch is about immediate value and preventing delay due to indecision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>.

This framework is one of many ways to be successful, and practitioners should adapt and steal elements that work for their specific situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>. The goal is to be useful to others, helping them overcome challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>.

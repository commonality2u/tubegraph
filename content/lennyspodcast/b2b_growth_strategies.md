[[Strategies for marketing and brand differentiation in B2B companies | Elena Verna]], a recognized expert in growth strategy, emphasizes that [[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | B2B growth]] is a "layering game" and a "sequential game," rather than a binary choice between different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The most successful companies are able to execute multiple strategies correctly and simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

## Evolution of B2B Products and Growth

Historically, B2B products were often perceived as less engaging than consumer products, focusing on utility, efficiency, and problem-solving for an "Enterprise buyer" who might not even be the direct user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. This led to "cold interfaces," "feature checklists," and "unusable products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

However, a significant shift has occurred over the last decade:
*   **Decision-Making Shift** The power to choose B2B products has moved towards the "prosumer" or employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Consumerization of B2B** The new wave of B2B products are "shiny and fun," "consumer-like," focusing on building habits and becoming integral to users' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. This means building for users, not just buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.
*   **Focus on Effectiveness** The goal is not just to do a job at a good cost, but to make users better, more productive, and more successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Examples** Companies like Slack and Miro have bypassed traditional enterprise sales by focusing on user adoption, leading to users advocating for the software within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

## Product-Led Growth (PLG) and Sales-Led Growth

### Defining Product-Led and Bottom-Up
[[growth_strategies_for_saas_businesses | Product-led growth]] (PLG) refers to being product-led in a company's growth model, which addresses how to acquire, retain, and monetize customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
*   **Bottom-Up** Specifically focuses on acquisition and monetization. It means leveraging product usage to generate leads for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. PLG is considered a rebranding of Bottom-Up, where product is pressured to generate leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.
*   **Product Qualification** In PLG, companies rely on "hand-raisers" and product qualification criteria to get closer to Enterprise-level contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

### Prioritizing PLG Efforts
[!TIP]
Every company should prioritize being product-led in retention first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   **Retention First** Without strong product-led retention (activation and engagement), a product has little chance of hooking an acquisition engine into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.
*   **Habitual Use** [[Marketplace growth strategies | Product-led acquisition]] relies on users buying, referring, or creating content. This is only possible if users habitually use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Collaboration at Core** PLG works best for products with a one-to-many relationship or collaboration at their core, like Slack or Miro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. If a product doesn't have this, it's harder to establish product-led acquisition, necessitating reliance on marketing-led or sales-led approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

### The Danger of Crushing PLG
A common and "sad" pattern seen in companies that start product-led:
1.  **Initial Success** PLG leads to user love, word-of-mouth, community, and strong retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.
2.  **Monetization & Sales** Companies monetize with self-serve and gain traction, aggregating multiple users within organizations, leading to their first Enterprise contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
3.  **Over-Hiring Sales** Enticed by large Average Contract Values (ACVs), companies double down on sales, hiring more reps and forecasting based on usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.
4.  **Slowdown** Eventually, they run out of Enterprise buyers within their existing user base (often less than 30% of buyers are in the user base) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
5.  **Shift Upmarket** Companies then focus on finding buyers outside the user base, investing in Enterprise marketing (e.g., demand gen, ABM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
6.  **Crucial Mistake** Most companies (around 80%) make the "crucial mistake of letting go of their product usage growth" and product-led tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Resources are prioritized for Enterprise sales (e.g., hiring ABM specialists over growth PMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>.
7.  **Consequences** This leads to a massive slowdown in Enterprise pipeline because the original user growth, community, and habitual loops dry up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
8.  **Reinvestment or Pivot** Many correct and reinvest in product-led growth, while others pivot entirely to a top-down sales machine, which requires a fundamentally different structure and profiles of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

[!WARNING]
Companies should never forget their product-led roots if they started that way, and must recognize when to swing the pendulum back to correct course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

To avoid crushing PLG:
*   **Don't Compare ACVs** [[Growth strategies for SaaS businesses | Product-led growth]] and product-led sales are "expansion games" that land customers earlier with lower initial contract values than top-down sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. Incentive teams correctly based on this.
*   **Innovate for Users** Avoid focusing the product roadmap exclusively on Enterprise features. Continue to innovate and delight users to empower them as selling agents within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

### The Future: Product-Led Sales
[[Building a sales team in B2B SaaS | Product-led sales]] is an emerging trend that will "box out top-down sales organizations" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.

**Product-Led Sales vs. Sales-Driven**
*   **Product-Led Sales**
    *   Starts with product acquisition and self-serve usage (freemium or self-serve monetization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
    *   Leverages usage to understand when an entire Enterprise would benefit from the product, looking for "network effects within the user base" or team within an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>.
    *   Scores users based on usage volume, velocity, feature breadth, behavior, and demographics to assess the probability of a successful sale to the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.
    *   Sales gets involved after initial usage, primarily to engage "hand-raisers" (users who complete a sales lead form) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>.
    *   The product itself acts as the sales enablement material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
    *   Benefits include incredible cost of acquisition (cost of user, not buyer) and pipeline creation driven by usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.
*   **Traditional Sales-Led**
    *   Starts with marketing qualified leads (MQLs) or outbound prospecting to find a buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.
    *   Involves many demos and efforts to convince the buyer to purchase before significant usage occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.
    *   Often leads to utilization issues post-purchase because the sale was made before widespread user adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

Elena believes product-led sales is the future because it empowers users to make decisions and become sales agents, capturing user intent directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.

## Freemium vs. Trial Models

*   **Freemium** Allows for ongoing free product usage, often with feature or usage walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>.
*   **Trial** Allows free usage for a limited, time-bound period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

[!WARNING]
Superficial time-bound trials (e.g., 7 days) can alienate larger enterprises, as their project timelines and dependencies might require much longer to extract value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

**Recommendation:** Instead of time-bound trials, use usage-based freemium models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.
*   **Example: MongoDB** Offers a free, shared "community cluster" for experimentation without a time limit. Any production use case requires their paid monetization model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. This allows users to understand the product at their own pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.

[!TIP]
There is a freemium case for almost every product, especially when trying to land customers who may not be immediately monetized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. Companies should continuously innovate to push down the cost of self-serve provisioning, enabling more users to adopt their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

### Strategic Reasons for Freemium
A critical mistake is viewing freemium solely as a conversion rate optimization tactic for paid tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. Freemium should have a clear strategic business impact:
*   **Indirect Monetization** Facilitate virality or network effects, leading to acquisition (e.g., Miro's free boards, SurveyMonkey's free user base driving acquisition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.
*   **Sufficiency for Basic Users** If a feature becomes commoditized, offering it for free can differentiate the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.
*   **Aha Moment / POC** Provide a proof-of-concept experience that helps users understand the value (e.g., MongoDB's free cluster) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.
*   **Habit Loops** Encourage habitual usage (e.g., notifications, communication channels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.
*   **Strategic Landing** Acquire a segment that may not be monetized initially but offers expansion potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.
*   **Product Incubation / Data Collection** Serve as a breeding ground for discovering adjacent use cases or collecting data to build other paid products (e.g., LinkedIn's freemium network for Sales Navigator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.

[!TIP]
Anything that creates friction for the growth model should be gated in paid, while anything that promotes the growth model should be put into free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

## Hiring for Growth

### First Growth Hire
[!TIP]
It is often best to find a first growth hire internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.
*   **Internal Benefits** An internal hire (e.g., analyst, product manager, data analyst, engineer) is already familiar with the product and its authentic growth model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.
*   **External Risks** External hires might try to "copy-paste" a previous company's growth model, which rarely works and can lead to a high failure rate because each product's growth model is unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

### When to Hire a Full-Time Growth Person
A full-time growth person should only be hired once a company has achieved a "strong product-market fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.
*   **Criteria for Product-Market Fit:**
    *   Demonstrated retention (at least 6 months to a year post-initial offering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>.
    *   Some proven ability to acquire and monetize customers (green shoots of distribution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.
*   **Founding Team's Role** The founding team must establish the initial growth model themselves. Hiring a growth person to "figure out your growth model from the beginning" is a mistake and a delegation of a critical business function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

### General Advice for Driving Growth
[!TIP]
*   **Find Patterns** Understand how to find patterns in the problems being solved to minimize context switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
*   **Frameworks over Success Points** Focus on creating frameworks for growth rather than just replicating past "success points" or patterns, which have a high failure rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>.
*   **Growth Model** Think of growth as a systematic framework, not just conversion rates and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>. This approach creates a repeatable, sustainable, and competitively defensible growth model that fosters a growth culture and mindset across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.

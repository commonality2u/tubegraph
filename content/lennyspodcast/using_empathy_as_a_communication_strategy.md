Empathy is foundational to [[building_effective_communication_strategies | effective communication]] and presentation, serving as the core of Nancy Duarte's methodology at Duarte Incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. This approach is influenced by Duarte's personal experience, as being raised by a clinically narcissistic mother who lacked the "empathy gene" led her to continually emphasize its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. The absence of empathy being modeled for her made her actively pursue it as a crucial element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>. Every model and book she creates prioritizes empathy, emphasizing the need to consider "who am I speaking with" in any communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>.

## The Audience as the Hero

A key empathetic approach in presentations is positioning the audience as the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. Initially, Duarte believed the presenter was the hero due to their central role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. However, after studying archetypes, she realized that the presenter's true role is that of the mentor, while the audience holds the power to accept or reject an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>. The mentor "comes alongside the hero" (the audience) to help them overcome internal conflicts or provide a "magical tool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

This means a presenter must:
*   Understand the audience's internal conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:48">[01:19:48]</a>.
*   Provide solutions to soothe those conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.
*   Acknowledge the difficulty of the actions they are asking the audience to take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>.
*   Shift their mindset to consider how to help the audience get unstuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>.

### Practical Application: Listening Tours
To make the audience the hero, Duarte Incorporated conducts "listening tours" before major presentations, such as annual vision talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. This involves:
*   Surveys and interviews to gather information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:59">[01:20:59]</a>.
*   Comparing audience insights to presentation goals through "gap analysis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>.
*   Creating rough cuts of presentations and seeking feedback from leaders to ensure resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>.

## Infusing Stories with Empathy

[[how_storytelling_creates_memorable_communication | Storytelling]], when infused with empathy, becomes a powerful tool to influence audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a>. By using story structures, presenters can align brains with the audience, as studies show listeners' brains fire in the same order and place as the storyteller's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:14">[01:24:14]</a>.

### The "What Is / What Could Be / New Bliss" Framework
This framework, rooted in contrast, visually represents a story's rise and fall:
*   **What Is:** State the current reality or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:58">[01:26:58]</a>.
*   **What Could Be:** Present a solution or alternate future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>.
*   **New Bliss:** Paint a picture of a world where the idea is adopted, creating longing for this future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:14">[01:27:14]</a>.

This technique works in various contexts, from large stage talks to quick conversations, and can even be used to influence personal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The "what is, what could be, new bliss" structure leverages the natural human desire for resolution from a "messy middle" to a "happy ending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>.

### Empathy in Interpersonal Communication
The "what is, what could be, new bliss" framework can be applied to daily interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:44">[01:30:44]</a>. For example, when asking a spouse to do chores, one can start with the "what is" (current stressful situation), explain the "what could be" (the doggy daycare's benefits), and hint at the "new bliss" (a more relaxed marital state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:03">[01:33:03]</a>. This requires understanding the other person's communication needs, like providing more context for a detail-oriented individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:59">[01:32:59]</a>.

Empathy also extends to understanding "love languages" within a company culture, ensuring appreciation is shown in ways that resonate with each individual, such as a written note or a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:23">[01:34:23]</a>.

## Empathy in Visual Communication

To ensure the audience "sees what you're saying," presenters can use visual tools and diagrams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>. This is particularly important for complex topics like technology architecture or product flows, where visuals accompany verbal narratives for clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:12">[01:37:12]</a>.

### Tailoring Visuals
An empathetic approach means tailoring slide design to the audience's culture and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:51">[01:42:51]</a>. While some audiences expect cinematic, visually driven presentations, others (like some consulting firms or internal teams) may prefer denser slides with more information that aligns with their internal communication norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:22">[01:42:22]</a>. The goal is to avoid making a "cookie cutter" presentation and instead make it unique to the presenter and the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:06">[01:53:06]</a>.

### When to Forego Visuals
Sometimes, the most empathetic approach is to remove visuals entirely, allowing the audience to focus solely on the verbal message and the speaker's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:38">[01:40:38]</a>. This ensures 100% focus on the speaker's body, demeanor, and words, allowing the verbal narrative to paint pictures in the audience's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:47">[01:40:47]</a>.

## Empathy in Product Management

[[the_role_of_empathy_and_user_insights_in_product_management | Empathy and user insights]] are vital throughout the product development lifecycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>. An example from Airbnb illustrates this: the team literally "walked in the shoes of their customer" by hiring an illustrator to depict each scene of a user's day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. This [[understanding_customer_emotions_and_building_empathy_for_product_design | day-in-the-life storytelling method]] revealed that their strategy was flawed and prompted a shift to a mobile-first approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>. These visualized "keyframes" of the host and guest journey became the company's core strategy, emphasizing specific moments to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>.

Similarly, product managers presenting their work can benefit from empathy-driven [[effective_storytelling_in_interviews | storytelling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>. Instead of merely presenting a finished product, they can explain the "why" behind design choices, their passion, and the meaning behind the product, which can significantly influence its acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>. This adds meaning and rationale, moving things forward by adding narrative depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>.

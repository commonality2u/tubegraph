Developing [[ai_powered_product_teams | AI-powered products]] presents unique [[challenges and opportunities in building AI products | challenges]] that differentiate it from traditional software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The rapidly evolving technological landscape and the inherent uncertainties of artificial intelligence demand new approaches to product management and development.

## The Volatile Technology Base

Unlike traditional product development where the technology base is often fixed, [[leveraging_ai_in_product_development | AI product development]] is characterized by an ever-changing foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Every couple of months, computers gain unprecedented capabilities, forcing product teams to constantly re-evaluate how these advancements should reshape their offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Emergent Capabilities and Performance Uncertainty
A significant challenge is the unpredictable nature of AI models. New capabilities often emerge during model training, and even the research teams might not fully know what a model is capable of until it's developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This uncertainty extends to performance:
*   **Unknown accuracy**: It's unclear whether a model will perform at 60%, 90%, or 99% accuracy for a given task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Product design impact**: The required product design is vastly different depending on the model's accuracy, making early planning difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Internal disruption**: This rapid evolution means that a company's own research can internally disrupt existing product roadmaps, similar to how external factors like Apple's WWDC announcements might impact an app like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Navigating Enterprise and User Expectations

Developing [[ai_powered_product_teams | AI products]] for enterprise customers introduces additional complexities.
*   **Extended timelines**: Enterprise product development often involves longer feedback loops, with processes like requisition and deployment taking many months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Buyer-centric focus**: Success in enterprise is not solely about the product's utility to end-users, but also about meeting the goals of the purchasing buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This can include specific requirements like 60-day launch notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

For all users, a core challenge is the non-deterministic nature of AI systems.
*   **Unintuitive interactions**: Unlike traditional computers where the same input yields the same output, AI models can produce varied responses for identical inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. This goes against decades of built-up user intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **User adaptation**: While users adapt quickly to new technologies (e.g., Waymo, ChatGPT), educating a broad user base on new interaction paradigms requires deliberate effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

## The Role of Product Management in AI

The [[impact of AI on product development | impact of AI on product development]] reshapes the role of product managers (PMs).
*   **Instincts apply partially**: Traditional product instincts are useful for the latter stages of development, such as making final touches and understanding user problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. However, the initial phase of discovering and shaping AI capabilities is entirely different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Beyond features**: The job of a PM in 2024-2025 building [[impact of AI on Product Management and Development | AI-powered features]] is increasingly focused on model capabilities and development, rather than just surface-level features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The quality of a feature is now "gated on how well you have done the evals and the prompts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### The Criticality of Evals
A major challenge and key skill in [[tools and tips for AI product management | AI product management]] is effective evaluation (evals) of model performance.
*   **Eval-limited models**: Models today are often not intelligence-limited but "eval-limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. They can do more if properly taught and evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Defining success**: Many organizations struggle to define what success looks like for AI features, making it hard to conduct effective evaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **"Crappy eval to good"**: The ability to transform a poor evaluation into a good one is considered a crucial skill for AI product talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Human vs. model grading**: As models become more capable, they can sometimes outperform human evaluators, leading to a challenge in how to grade their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
*   **Nuance in evaluation**: For complex, open-ended tasks (like finding a hotel or complex reasoning), evaluation becomes less about right/wrong and more about nuanced performance akin to a human performance review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

### Evolving Skillsets for PMs
To address these [[challenges and advantages of AI in product management | challenges]], product people need to develop new skills.
*   **Prototyping with models**: PMs should use AI models themselves for rapid prototyping and A/B testing UI variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Deeper technical understanding**: PMs need to delve deeper into the technology stack to understand how AI systems work, even if not becoming researchers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   **Managing non-deterministic systems**: Understanding the output of a stochastic system, designing feedback mechanisms, and setting guardrails for AI models are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. This is distinct from debugging a predictable bug report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Model behavior as product**: The "personality" and behavior of the AI model itself are core product concerns, raising questions about customization versus a unified personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

## Conclusion: A Continuous Adaptation
The [[impact of AI tools on future product development skills | impact of AI tools on future product development skills]] means constant adaptation. As AI capabilities evolve rapidly, product teams must be prepared to reinvent their processes and understanding of what "good" looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. The shift requires new mental models, new skill sets, and a willingness to embrace uncertainty and co-creation with the AI itself.

Being a successful [[the_role_of_women_in_technology | woman in tech]] involves navigating unique challenges, interpreting feedback, and continuously expanding one's skillset. Amy Vora, Chief Product Officer at Fair, shares insights from her career on balancing [[authenticity_and_success_in_the_tech_industry | authenticity]] with professional growth and overcoming preconceived notions of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Challenging Perceptions of Success
Amy Vora's goal is to be as [[authenticity_and_success_in_the_tech_industry | authentic]] as possible, demonstrating that individuals can be "messy and imperfect at times" and still achieve significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. She observed that successful women earlier in her career appeared to have "everything figured out," resembling "super women" who were always perfect, which made her doubt her own path as she loved to sleep and waste time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. She often works from her bathroom due to family and work-from-home demands, illustrating the less glamorous reality behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Amy realized that "no one's got it fully figured out" and "most of us are winging it and learning as we're going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Her career success has come from following what "feels right," working in environments that feel like home, and collaborating with people who feel like friends, rather than adhering to a rigid career plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Navigating Feedback and Self-Confidence
Amy received feedback early in her career that, despite being "the smartest person in the room," it "doesn't matter if people don't like you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. This led her to consciously try to be "more likable" by "shrinking myself a little bit," being less aggressive and opinionated, and even wearing "earth tones for like two years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>. While this approach initially "worked for a long time," she later found it challenging when expected to provide strong opinions and leadership in senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.

Her current philosophy on such feedback is to encourage expanding "tool sets" rather than shrinking oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. This means building "new keys to unlock new different kinds of doors" to work with a broader range of people and problems, which ultimately makes one "bigger and more powerful and more expansive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

Amy also notes that [[the_role_of_women_in_technology | women often receive feedback that is more personal]] and focused on "style" rather than "the content of their role" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. This feedback can sometimes be "diametrically opposite," such as being told to be "more directive" by some and "less directive" by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of learning how to interpret and respond to feedback, choosing whether to act on it immediately, look for themes, or decide to "keep operating" with a clear understanding of trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>.

## Redefining Mentorship and Growth
Amy suggests that advice often given to [[the_role_of_women_in_technology | women]], such as needing to find a mentor or sponsor, can be "another set of hoops" to jump through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>. While she benefited from the "extreme generosity of so many wonderful leaders," she didn't feel she had a single mentor who provided all the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.

Her key advice for young [[the_role_of_women_in_technology | women in tech]] is to "not dampen who you are and your strengths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. Instead, they should "just continue expanding whenever you run into a problem, just add more to the things that you can do, the tools that you have, the way you can express yourself, just keep on adding and growing and don't like shrink yourself ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.

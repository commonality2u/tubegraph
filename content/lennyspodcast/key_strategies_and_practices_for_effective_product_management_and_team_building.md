This article explores the product management strategies and practices employed at Ramp, a rapidly growing Software as a Service (SaaS) business. Drawing insights from Jeff Charles, VP of Product at Ramp, it delves into how the company cultivates a culture of velocity, empowers its teams, and optimizes for rapid execution and high impact.

## Ramp's Unique Approach to Product
Ramp has achieved remarkable growth, becoming the fastest-growing SaaS business in history, reaching over $100 million in annual run rate in two years with a lean team of around 50 people in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>. As a finance automation platform and corporate card solution for small to medium-sized businesses, Ramp focuses on automating expense management, card payments, bill payments, and accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

The company's success is attributed to an approach that prioritizes moving quickly, thinking from first principles, and empowering individual team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

## The Power of Velocity
Velocity is foundational to Ramp's operations. It dictates how the product development process is designed, how teams are incentivized, who is hired and promoted, and how decisions are made and the organization is structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This focus originated from a small team facing a huge market opportunity during the pandemic, where speed of execution was paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Velocity is seen as a key metric for team performance, enabling impact through rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. It also helps attract top talent, as many individuals join Ramp specifically because they want to build and ship things quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Additionally, high velocity de-risks decision-making, as the cost of a wrong decision is low when adjustments can be made swiftly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Operationalizing Velocity
Ramp's rapid development includes building an MX competitor in three months with 8 engineers, an Expensify competitor six months later, and a competitive Bill.com product in three months with a team of three engineers, one designer, and one PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

The "recipe" for this velocity involves:
*   **Small, Single-Threaded Teams** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>: Individuals or small teams focus on one single goal without distractions, sometimes even working in a dedicated room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This means removing any other tasks like research, production engineering, or external processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Lofty Goals with Tight Timelines**: Ambitious goals are set, often benchmarked against public companies in existing markets, or by crafting visionary designs that motivate teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Shielding Teams from Chaos**: Core teams are protected from external distractions (e.g., bugs, escalations, customer requests) by dedicated individuals like production engineers on a rotational program or product operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. For big bets, sub-teams are reorganized without existing product responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Empowerment and Context Over Control**: Leaders prioritize providing context rather than being prescriptive about solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Alignment is focused on the goal, hypothesis, and data, allowing teams closer to the ground to devise better solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This approach fosters [[product_management_competencies | self-sufficiency]] and [[attributes_of_successful_product_managers | decision-making]].
    *   Managers act as "repeaters in chief," sharing context from higher-level meetings to help teams make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
    *   The "contract" between leadership and teams is their strategy and roadmap, with teams highlighting risks and one-way decisions requiring input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.
*   **Streamlined Planning and Strategy**: Planning is minimized to avoid slowing down execution. Ramp moved from time-consuming quarterly OKRs to a bi-annual one-pager outlining company priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.
    *   Strategy defines *how* to achieve goals, not just vision or roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. It includes goals, hypotheses, unique positioning, metrics, initiatives, risks, and long-term outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.
    *   Each product pod writes its own strategy document, fostering a culture where every team thinks like a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.
    *   Accuracy in planning is only increased for high-value events like large marketing moments (e.g., once a quarter or every six months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.
*   **Quality Control Mechanisms**: Despite high velocity, quality is maintained and improved.
    *   A "Voice of Customer" process shares every negative review with the tech lead, PM, and designer monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
    *   NPS, CSAT, and "operational overhead" (percentage of tickets from a product area normalized by users) are regularly reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
    *   Bugs are fixed immediately and directly assigned to engineers on call, making them feel the pain and quickly resolve issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
    *   If user experience metrics (e.g., tickets from confused customers) are elevated, teams are halted from shipping new features until issues are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

## Building and Nurturing the Product Team
Ramp believes that a culture of velocity is underpinned by the quality of its engineering and design talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

### Hiring for Impact and Deep Thinking
*   Ramp seeks individuals with a strong desire for impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>. A key signal is candidates leaving previous roles due to slow processes or bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.
*   The company highly values the ability to think deeply, assessing this by delving into past decisions and trade-offs candidates have made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.
*   Less emphasis is placed on extensive past experience, as Ramp's unique business model (credit card, payments, software for SMB and Enterprise) requires adaptability and first principles thinking rather than pattern matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.
*   Engineers are expected to care about market outcomes, understand business context, ask questions beyond engineering, and proactively contribute to fixing issues or helping customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>.

### Fostering a Culture of Empowerment
*   The CEO sets the vision but is "much less opinionated about the specific sequence" to get there, trusting the empowered tech organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   Meetings and status updates are minimized; statuses are done asynchronously in real-time systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. Meetings are reserved for collaboration, ideation, and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.
*   Leaders must clearly communicate trade-offs, providing leadership with a "menu of items" rather than trying to do "everything under the sun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This focus allows for much faster execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
*   Leaders provide motivation by showing genuine interest in projects, commenting on channels, and giving engineers opportunities to present their work in All Hands meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

### Avoiding Burnout
Ramp views velocity as a way to avoid burnout, rather than cause it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
*   Burnout often occurs when effort doesn't lead to impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. High velocity means teams are constantly building and seeing their work move, leading to a sense of accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
*   The goal is to help people get into a "flow state" where work is thrilling, by minimizing distractions, meetings, and cross-functional demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
*   It's crucial for individuals to feel that the work is *their* goal and that they are empowered to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.

### Product Management's Core Role at Ramp
With a lean PM team (13 PMs for over 100 engineers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>, the PM role is amplified by enabling others to "think like PMs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.
*   **Team Building**: Creating a strong team culture within the pod, including organizing off-sites and ideation sessions, is a core responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.
*   **Protecting the Team**: Shielding the core team from stakeholders, managing interruptions, and being the central point of contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.
*   **Strategic Focus**: Defining the vision and priorities at a high level. PMs don't write tickets or spend much time in ticket management systems; this is pushed to engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.
*   **Product Operations**: Ramp invests in a product operations team that reports to product, focusing on operational functions like project management, issue management, release management, enablement, and customer research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This frees up PMs for higher-leverage work.
*   **Support Reporting to Product**: Uniquely, the support team reports directly to the VP of Product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. This ensures product teams are directly accountable for "failures of the product" that generate support tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

## The Importance of First Principles Thinking
Ramp operates in a unique business environment, combining credit card, payments, and software aspects, serving both SMBs and enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>. This complexity necessitates thinking from first principles, rather than pattern matching from past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

It's about going back to the fundamentals of what you're trying to do and thinking through them deeply, putting aside previous experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.
::

An example of first principles thinking is the decision to have the support team report to product, based on the principle that "every support ticket is a failure of our product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This led to incentivizing support staff to decrease ticket volume and hiring individuals who became leaders in other parts of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

## Effective Communication and Organization
*   **Writing as Thinking**: For complex problems, Jeff Charles advocates for writing down a question simply and spending time thinking to answer it, before seeking external answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>. This helps clarify thoughts and communicate effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.
*   **Minimizing Meetings**: To preserve deep work time, notifications are turned off, Slack is checked only at the top of the hour, and emails are processed quickly once a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>.
*   **Robust Task Management**: Tasks are clearly written down at the end of every meeting, specifying what is owed and by when <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. Tasks are then grouped logically (tactical vs. strategic, important vs. less important), and reminders are set for others' deliverables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. The goal is to free up "headspace for processing, not memory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.

By combining an extreme focus on velocity with empowered, high-quality teams and a culture of deep, first-principles thinking, Ramp has established a unique and highly effective model for [[product_management_skill_development_framework | product development]] and [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | organizational growth]].

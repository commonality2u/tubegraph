Developing and implementing product strategy is a core responsibility for product managers (PMs), though it represents only a small fraction of their overall work [00:10:16]. While having a good strategy is crucial for selecting the right products, success ultimately hinges on the PM's ability to ship products, gain experience, and create impact [00:10:23]. Being "great at strategy" is insufficient if products are not successfully launched [00:10:40].

## The Role of Strategy in Product Management

Maggie Crowley, VP of Product at Toast, highlights that as product managers become more senior, feedback often shifts towards needing to be "more strategic" [00:35:10]. This feedback is particularly common for underrepresented individuals in tech aspiring to leadership roles [00:35:16]. To address this, Crowley devised a tactical approach to demonstrate strategic thinking through written documentation [00:35:30].

## How to Write a Product Strategy

Crowleyâ€™s approach to writing a product strategy originated from an engineer's persistent questions about "why" certain decisions were made [00:35:48]. This led her to create a detailed Google Doc, serving as a comprehensive outline for strategic thinking. The document progresses from high-level company vision to specific action plans.

### Components of a Product Strategy Document

A product strategy document should include the following sections [00:36:05]:

1.  **Mission and Goals**
    *   The company's overall mission and point [00:36:05].
    *   High-level company goals and framing [00:36:10].
2.  **Landscape**
    *   Current business situation [00:36:19].
    *   Product performance [00:36:19].
    *   Point of view on the market [00:36:20].
    *   Competitors [00:36:24].
    *   SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis [00:36:24].
    *   Key risks [00:36:25].
    *   Current quarter's business goals or planning priorities [00:36:30].
3.  **Current State Assessment**
    *   An honest accounting of the product's current state [00:36:47].
    *   The overall business state [00:36:49].
    *   The specific area of focus [00:36:51].
    *   What is working and what is not [00:36:51].
    *   Customer and user feedback (bottom-up feedback, support tickets) [00:36:58].
    *   Technical hurdles, significant tech debt, and upcoming technical changes [00:37:04].
4.  **Opportunity**
    *   Identify the top one or two opportunities that emerge from the landscape and current state analysis [00:37:37].
    *   Define where the team wants to "play" and "win" [00:37:42].
    *   Explain the unique competitive advantage [00:37:42].
5.  **Challenges**
    *   Identify the hardest aspects of pursuing the opportunity [00:37:55].
    *   Consider what "has to be true about the world" for the strategy to succeed [00:37:59].
6.  **Solution**
    *   Outline the proposed solution [00:38:06].
    *   Describe what needs to be built and how it might work [00:38:12].
    *   Limit main points to three bullets maximum [00:38:18].
7.  **Plan**
    *   Detail the execution plan, assuming no external opinions [00:38:26].
    *   Consider sequencing, team structure, and potential costs [00:38:31].

### Sharing and Utilizing the Strategy Document

The strategy document should be shared widely within the organization [00:38:37]. There should be no secrets, allowing anyone to trace the logic from the company's mission down to individual priorities [00:38:40]. This transparency helps clarify disagreements by grounding them in specific data points rather than general dissent [00:38:57].

Crowley notes that this type of detailed strategy is more appropriate for higher-level product initiatives, such as quarterly or annual planning, rather than for every small feature [00:40:21]. It is also valuable when a team needs to make a pivot or pursue a new opportunity [00:46:18].

While the document can be extensive (up to 20 pages with screenshots and detailed analyses), it should always include a summary at the top, following the [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | Minto Pyramid Principle]], to provide a quick overview of the key points and proposed strategy [00:41:55]. The primary purpose of this lengthy document is for the PM's own confidence and homework, ensuring they have thoroughly thought through their decisions [00:43:01]. Engineering and design counterparts often engage deeply with the document, as they are also on the hook for the product's success [00:43:14].

A common challenge after developing a strategy is realizing that the existing product roadmap is bloated and misaligned with the new strategy [00:47:24]. This realization, even without the immediate agency to scrap the roadmap, allows for critical evaluation and re-prioritization [00:47:50].

## Product One-Pagers and PRDs

In addition to high-level strategy documents, Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) or "one-pagers" are crucial artifacts for defining specific product initiatives [00:50:03].

### Key Sections of a One-Pager

Crowley emphasizes that a one-pager should start with the "why" [00:50:45]. The most important sections are [00:51:57]:

*   **Background and Context**: Setting the stage for the problem.
*   **The Problem**: Clearly stating the issue.
*   **Why This Problem Matters**: Explaining the significance of the problem.
*   **Why This Problem Matters Now**: Justifying the urgency and timing of solving this particular problem over others [00:52:07]. This highlights whether there is a perishable opportunity that must be seized immediately [00:53:00].

By clearly defining the problem and its importance, the rest of the document becomes much easier to articulate [00:51:02]. This document serves as the team's "home base" for decisions throughout the project [00:51:30]. It should also maintain a running list of decisions made and links to relevant research and artifacts [00:51:36].

PMs should not be "precious" about their work and should actively seek feedback, especially from their engineering counterparts, to refine the document [00:52:21].

Maggie Crowley, Vice President of Product at Toast, outlines three common threads she has observed across the most successful product managers (PMs) she has worked with, hired, and managed. These [[top_attributes_of_a_successful_product_manager | attributes]] distinguish good PMs from great ones, regardless of company size or industry focus (consumer, B2B, startup, or large company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Top 3 Traits of Successful Product Managers

### 1. Simplification and Focus
The best PMs excel at breaking down complex problems and simplifying tasks, identifying the single most important thing to focus on at any given moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. In large companies with numerous priorities and projects, teams can get bogged down by complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. At startups, despite fewer perceived options, the abundance of opportunities and fires can make it difficult to pick one thing and stick with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Successful PMs not only find the "one thing" but also remain dedicated to it long enough to see it through to completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This involves more than just prioritization; it requires the ability to ensure that the chosen priority remains the most important thing, that it gets finished, and that the team remains excited and engaged in the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. PMs must continuously "beat that drum" and possess the resilience and energy to stay with a project that might take weeks, months, or even a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### How to Build this Muscle
*   **Read content aloud**: When writing documents, read them out loud to identify areas that are too complicated or unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. The goal is to "just say that" â€“ write exactly what you would say in conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Get feedback**: Seek out people who can review your work and help you simplify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Listen to their insights, recognizing that experienced individuals, including founders, often have valuable market knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Cut unnecessary words**: A helpful resource for writing concisely is the book "On Writing Well," which emphasizes removing unnecessary elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. A general rule of thumb is that the first two paragraphs of almost any document can be deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   **Apply the "Rule of Three"**: When outlining strategies or priorities, aim for three points or fewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This principle helps maintain clarity and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Form a peer review group**: Create a small, non-competitive group of product leaders or peers who can provide continuous feedback and help simplify work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

### 2. Following Up on Results
Truly effective PMs remember to follow up on the results of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. While many define a metric they care about and may even set up dashboards, few consistently check back weeks or months later to see what happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This is a rare and highly valued activity, especially by managers who often don't have the capacity to track every feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### How to Build this Muscle
*   **Set calendar reminders**: Schedule reminders for two weeks, one month, and six months after a product launch to check dashboards or metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
*   **Proactively share progress**: Don't rely on managers to notice your success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Regularly share your progress and results to ensure your impact is recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
*   **Continuously learn**: Following up allows PMs to learn why something succeeded or failed, improving their effectiveness with each new product shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. The more a PM ships, the more they learn and build expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

### 3. Carrying the Water (Doing the Unglamorous Work)
Successful PMs are willing to do the hard, boring, and unglamorous work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. If you ever find yourself saying, "that's not my job," it's likely something you *should* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. While it might genuinely be someone else's responsibility, getting the work done regardless leads to faster progress and more successful products, and reduces frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

As a PM, you are often the emotional center of the team, responsible for keeping people motivated, excited, and bought into the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. This requires maintaining optimism, which is hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. Examples of "carrying the water" include:
*   Customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
*   Sales calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>
*   Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
*   Writing copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
*   Project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
*   Implementing solutions with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>
*   Quality Assurance (QA) of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>

### Why it Matters
Unlike engineers whose job is to write code or designers whose job is to design solutions, PMs don't have a singular, narrow responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. The PM's ultimate goal is to deliver a business result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. This unique position means PMs must fill all the gaps, as no one else is incentivized to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. If the problem isn't solved for the customer, the PM hasn't done their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

> [00:29:00] "When in doubt, it's your job as a PM." - Maggie Crowley

The PM role, while often perceived as glamorous, involves a significant amount of "bullshit work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. It's about taking responsibility, making bets, and being accountable for the outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. None of the necessary tasks are "above" a PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

### Building Expertise
It takes years to truly become proficient as a PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Maggie Crowley felt confident in her abilities only after about five years of experience, including two years in a product management rotation program and then being the sole product person at a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. She learned significantly more by staying at one company (Drift) for almost four years, experiencing two or three cycles of the same product, which allowed her to observe the consequences of her decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

While job hopping can lead to career progression, staying with a company for a longer period allows for deeper learning and builds expertise that can accelerate future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

### [[transitioning_into_product_management | Breaking into Product Management]]
It can be challenging to [[tips_for_aspiring_product_managers | break into product management]], especially if you lack prior PM experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. Common pathways include:
*   **Entry-level programs**: Some big tech companies offer entry-level PM programs, though these are often highly competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.
*   **Lateral moves within a company**: Switching to a PM role within your current company can be challenging but is a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
*   **Joining startups**: Startups may be more willing to hire individuals without a direct PM background, as they prioritize individuals who can "carry the water" and are willing to learn quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.

> [00:33:37] "Once you have a PM title on your resume, everything gets easier." - Maggie Crowley

Hiring managers often screen for prior PM experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. Therefore, the primary goal for aspiring PMs should be to secure that first PM title, even if it requires significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. Once you have it, the next question typically becomes, "What have you shipped?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

## Product Strategy and Documentation

### Developing a Product Strategy
A product strategy clarifies the team's direction and helps align stakeholders. Maggie Crowley developed a comprehensive framework for outlining product strategy to ensure clarity and demonstrability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

#### Strategy Document Outline:
1.  **Mission and Goals**: Start with the company's mission and overarching goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.
2.  **Landscape**: Detail the current business environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. This includes:
    *   What's happening with the business and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.
    *   Point of view on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.
    *   Competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.
    *   SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) and key risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.
    *   Current quarterly business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
3.  **Current State**: Provide an honest assessment of the product, business, and specific area of focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>. Include:
    *   What works and what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
    *   Customer feedback (users, support tickets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.
    *   Technical hurdles, tech debt, and engineering priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
4.  **Opportunity**: Identify the top one or two opportunities for the team based on the gathered information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. Define where the team can uniquely play and win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
5.  **Challenges**: Outline the difficulties in pursuing the identified opportunities and what needs to be true for the strategy to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
6.  **Solution**: Propose the solution, what needs to be built, and how it might work (ideally three bullet points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.
7.  **Plan**: Detail how the solution would be sequenced and implemented, including team requirements and estimated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

This document, often lengthy, serves as the PM's "homework" to build confidence in their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. It should be shared widely to ensure transparency and allow for constructive disagreement based on specific points of data rather than general opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. Engineers and designers often engage deeply with the document, as they are on the line for execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.

### The One-Pager (Spec/PRD)
The one-pager (or PRD/spec) is the PM's primary artifact, defining the product team's initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Its core purpose is to answer *why*:
*   **Background and Context**: What is the problem? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>
*   **Why it Matters**: Why does this problem matter? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>
*   **Why it Matters Now**: Why is this problem worth solving *right now* compared to other opportunities? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>

This document should serve as the "home base" for all subsequent decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. It's crucial to share it with the team early, before progressing too far, to invite critical feedback and poke holes in the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. As a PM, you cannot be precious about your work; people need to challenge it to make it better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.

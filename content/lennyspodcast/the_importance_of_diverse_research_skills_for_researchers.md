Jud Anon, who helped build the user research practice at Facebook and served as the longtime head of research at Airbnb, emphasizes that the user research field is undergoing a [[the_evolution_and_challenges_within_the_user_research_field | reckoning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. He believes the discipline as it has existed over the last 15 years is "dying" and must adapt quickly to survive and thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. A key part of this adaptation involves researchers developing a diverse set of skills to drive greater impact.

## The Problem: Focus on "Middle Range" Research

Anon argues that the user research field often focuses too much on "middle range" research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. While this type of research, which involves taking a group of people and asking questions about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors with a product, can be interesting, it is often not impactful enough for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. This leads to results that are:
*   Interesting but hard to operationalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   Prone to "post-hoc bias," where people confidently claim, "that was kind of obvious; we knew that already" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.
*   Used to signal "customer obsession" or "user-centered practice" without leading to different decisions, a phenomenon he calls "user-centered performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

This prevalent middle-range research, often requested by Product Managers (PMs) to validate assumptions at the end of a product process, is "too late to matter" and serves only to "check the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This contributes to the perception that research is slow and delays product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

## The Solution: A "Swiss Army Knife" of Skills

To move past this "reckoning" and ensure research drives significant value, researchers must evolve beyond being solely qualitative specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. The best researchers are multi-method and possess a "Swiss army knife" of skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>. These "five tools" are essential for driving business impact:

1.  **Formative or Generative User Experience Research** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>:
    *   Focuses on looking ahead, innovation, and understanding the market and competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
    *   Involves open-ended, ethnographic approaches, such as observing users in their natural environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>.
    *   Helps answer big-picture strategic questions about where the product should go long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.

2.  **Evaluative Research** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>:
    *   Primarily usability testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.
    *   Focused on micro-level details to ensure a high-quality, pixel-perfect product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.
    *   Can reveal problems with functionality quickly, leading to significant business metric improvements (e.g., the "multi-million dollar button" at Airbnb, where a change in button text, based on user feedback, generated millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:00">[35:37:00]</a>) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:10:00">[38:10:00]</a>. This type of "quick research" can deliver huge business value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:35:00">[38:35:00]</a>.

3.  **Rigorous Survey Design** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>:
    *   The best scaled way to gather responses from communities of all sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.
    *   Requires skill to craft effective surveys to get actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

4.  **Applied Statistics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>:
    *   Understanding basic statistics is crucial, especially for interacting with A/B test results and understanding why outcomes occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:38:00">[41:38:00]</a>. This partnership between data scientists and researchers is vital for the next evolution of the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:58:00">[41:58:00]</a>.

5.  **Technical Skills (SQL/Prompt Engineering)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>:
    *   Historically, this involved knowing SQL to run queries and understand data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.
    *   Today, it may also include prompt engineering for interacting with generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. These skills enable researchers to leverage the vast amounts of data available in companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>.

### Beyond Technical Skills: Business Acumen and Communication

In addition to these technical research methods, skilled researchers must also:
*   **Be business-oriented**: Understand the company's business goals, read quarterly reports, listen to shareholder calls, and comprehend the company's OKRs, metrics, and conversion funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>. This allows them to propose research questions that directly address business problems and drive maximum impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>.
*   **Be excellent communicators**: Effectively communicate research findings, tailoring their message to different audiences, such as PMs or executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. This includes being able to break down complex problems simply and provide clear intuitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:10]</a>.
*   **Build strong relationships**: Collaborate consistently with product, design, and engineering teams from the beginning of a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>. When researchers are integrated partners, rather than a service function, they can drive significant product improvement, metrics impact, and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:00">[51:13:00]</a>.
*   **Challenge assumptions (falsify, not validate)**: Instead of merely validating existing assumptions, a good researcher actively seeks to be wrong and identify where a product or approach is off-base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:00]</a>. This requires a growth mindset and an openness to learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:53:00">[28:53:00]</a>.

## How to Evaluate and Foster These Skills

When interviewing researchers, evaluate their ability to approach open-ended questions using a multi-method strategy, considering how a project could be handled in varying timeframes (a day, a week, or a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>. Companies should aim to build teams where individuals are "t-shaped," possessing a broad understanding of these tools while specializing deeply in one or several <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>.

For individual researchers, the advice is to proactively develop these diverse research skills, deepen business knowledge, and build strong relationships with partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>. They should also learn to say "no" to less impactful requests, focusing on fewer things done better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:44:00">[48:44:00]</a>.

Ultimately, while many companies might feel they were "misunderstood" or "sidelined," researchers have the power to shape their [[career_development_for_ai_individual_contributors | careers]] and the discipline by being proactive, developing broad skills, and constantly seeking to drive tangible business value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. The future of the discipline is bright, but it requires continuous evolution and a commitment to integrating research as a core, influential partner in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

### ![[Role of curiosity and unique talents in career]]
Anon's views on diverse research skills align with the idea that individuals should cultivate a broad toolkit. Just as [[future_skills_for_software_engineers_in_aidriven_development | software engineers need future skills in AI-driven development]], researchers must adapt and expand their capabilities to remain relevant and impactful. The ability to communicate complex topics simply, as highlighted in his favorite interview question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>, is an example of a valuable [[impact_of_speaking_as_a_meta_skill | meta-skill]] that transcends specific research methods.

### ![[Collaboration between research and product teams]]
Anon stresses that the most significant challenge for user researchers is their relationship with product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This highlights the critical need for [[integrating_user_research_effectively_into_product_development | effective integration]] of research from the project's inception, rather than treating it as a reactive, service function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

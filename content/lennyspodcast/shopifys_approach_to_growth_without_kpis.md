Shopify, a major force in e-commerce, takes a distinctive approach to [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | company growth]] that often defies conventional wisdom, particularly concerning the use of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. Archie Abrams, VP of Product and Head of Growth at Shopify, leads an organization of over 600 people across various functions and explains how Shopify's unique structure and philosophy drive its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## A Hundred-Year Vision and the Role of Taste

At the heart of Shopify's philosophy is a "hundred-year vision" set by CEO Tobi LÃ¼tke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. This long-term outlook significantly influences how product development and growth are approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

One of the most surprising aspects is that core product teams at Shopify often operate without specific metrics or KPIs; they are "essentially banned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. Instead, decisions for core product development are based on "taste and intuition" and building towards this long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. The focus is on building the "right technical foundation to build the future of Commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>. This deliberate choice allows Shopify to prioritize long-term adaptability and flexibility in its platform, even if it means taking longer to ship features or not chasing short-term deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

This approach works due to a highly "opinionated founder" and a small number of leaders who have "extremely strong opinions on what good is and what taste is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>. Every project across the company, regardless of team, is reviewed every six weeks by top leadership, including Tobi, ensuring a consistent quality bar and alignment with the long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.

## Growth Team's Focus: Absolute Numbers and Cohort Value

While core product teams operate by "taste," the growth team does use metrics, but with a crucial distinction: they optimize for "total value" rather than rates or percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

Shopify's mission is to increase entrepreneurship on the internet by lowering the barriers to getting started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Most businesses ultimately fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Shopify's revenue model, which is primarily tied to payments (GMV) rather than just subscriptions, means that a few highly successful merchants can make an entire cohort profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This is likened to Angel Investing, where a few big wins make the portfolio successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

Instead of focusing on churn reduction or conversion rates for specific funnel stages, the growth team's North Star is the "total GMV" (Gross Merchandise Volume) produced by a cohort of merchants over extended periods (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This approach encourages teams to focus on the absolute number of people who successfully complete their journey, rather than optimizing a local conversion rate, which could lead to perverse incentives like making the preceding step harder to inflate one's own metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

## [[longterm_experimentation_and_decision_making_at_shopify | Long-Term Experimentation and Decision-Making]]

Shopify's unique measurement philosophy extends to its experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. They maintain long-term holdouts for every experiment they run, automatically reviewing the impact of changes a year, two years, or even three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. This allows them to see if short-term wins truly translate to long-term impact on GMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

### Surprising Findings from Long-Term Holdouts
*   **Short-Term Lift Often Doesn't Last**: Roughly 30-40% of experiments that show a short-term lift (e.g., more paying shops, first sale) show "no incremental lift on GMV" a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This often indicates a "pull forward" effect rather than true incremental growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
    *   **Example: Payment Failure Notifications**: Improving notifications for failed payments initially showed a significant short-term lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. However, a year later, there was "no long-term lift" in GMV, suggesting that those who let payments fail were not dedicated entrepreneurs, regardless of the reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. This demonstrates how some [[growth_tactics_that_do_not_work | growth tactics that do not work]] in the long run.
*   **Neutral Short-Term Results Can Become Positive**: In some cases, experiments that show "no lift" or are "neutral" in the short term can have a "pretty massive impact" on long-term GMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
    *   **Example: Pre-configured Online Store Sections**: Providing pre-configured sections in the online store editor (e.g., image, text banner, collage) showed no immediate lift in new merchants converting to paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. However, six months later, it had a substantial positive impact on GMV because it helped merchants create better, higher-converting stores, leading to early sales and sustained engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. This has led Shopify to "ship neutral" experiments if they have a good intuition about their long-term benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.
*   **Uncovering Valuable Merchant Segments**: Sometimes, these long-term analyses reveal "pockets of merchants that are actually extremely valuable entrepreneurs" who were missed by short-term measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This is particularly true when reducing "monetary friction" (e.g., trial length, incentives, price points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

To facilitate this, Shopify has an internal experimentation system that automatically tracks experiment cohorts and sends updated results at three, six, and twelve-month intervals, holding teams accountable for long-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

## [[growth_team_structure_and_collaboration_at_shopify | Growth Team Structure and Collaboration]]

Shopify's growth organization is split into two main groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>:
1.  **Growth R&D**: Includes product, design, engineering, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>. This group has three pillars:
    *   **Growth Products**: Covers the entire customer lifecycle from landing pages, signup, onboarding, and monetization (trials, incentives) to engagement, helping merchants grow their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. [[productled_growth_strategies | Product-led growth]] is a historical strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.
    *   **Tools**: Builds internal tools like the experimentation platform, communication platform, business intelligence tooling, and marketing technology (MarTech) to support growth marketing and the wider Shopify organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.
    *   **Customer Support**: Unusually, this group sits within growth. They build tools and experiences to make support advisors "superheroes" and enhance self-serve options, viewing support as an integral part of the merchant's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.
2.  **Growth Marketing**: Handles paid acquisition, media buying, affiliate marketing, email, content, and SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. They focus on driving new users to Shopify.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

### Collaboration and Healthy Tension
Despite the core product team's focus on "taste" and the growth team's focus on "absolute numbers" and long-term GMV, there is a strong partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. This relationship is built on trust, acknowledging that the teams are "intentionally meant to be almost at odds" to create healthy tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.

A key area of discussion often involves "wizards" or onboarding carousels. The growth team might see value in such simplified flows for quick activation, while core product leadership typically adheres to a "no wizard principle," preferring to integrate such simplification directly into the product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. This push-and-pull ensures that growth initiatives are aligned with the overall product philosophy and quality bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>.

## Embedded Marketing and No CMO

Shopify does not have a central Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. Instead, marketing functions are embedded across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>:
*   Growth marketing sits within the growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
*   Revenue marketing is closer to sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
*   A brand team operates under the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.
*   Product Marketing Managers (PMMs) sit with product managers in core teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

This structure allows marketing to be "closest to the primary kind of goal" of their respective teams, enabling faster movement and less coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. It works because Tobi and Harley, the president, possess "amazing intuition on what the brand is [and] needs to be," effectively fulfilling the CMO's role of creating a cohesive story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.

## Key Learnings for Sustainable Growth

Shopify's distinctive approach to [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | sustainable growth]] without traditional KPIs offers valuable lessons:
*   **Long-Term Vision is Crucial**: A clear, long-term vision (like the 100-year plan) can guide decisions and allow for patience in realizing impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.
*   **Absolute Numbers vs. Rates**: Focusing on absolute total value (e.g., total GMV) rather than conversion rates or retention percentages can align incentives across teams and prevent detrimental local optimizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
*   **Deep Technical Acumen**: A founder's deep understanding of the "how" â the technical architecture â can profoundly determine strategy and enable long-term flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.
*   **Founder's Taste and Accountability**: Operating without metrics requires either a "very opinionated founder" or a small group of leaders with "extremely strong opinions on what good is and what taste is" to maintain quality and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>. Without this, teams risk building "a bunch of cool stuff" in a haphazard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>.
*   **Embrace Hybrid Journeys**: When integrating new motions like sales, it's important to build "hybrid journeys" that allow customers to move seamlessly between self-service and sales-assisted paths, even if it complicates traditional attribution models initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. The ultimate goal for measuring effectiveness across these channels is incrementality testing, which reveals the causal impact of different efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>.
*   **[[avoiding_traditional_metrics_for_product_development | Avoiding traditional metrics for product development]]** requires strong leadership alignment on product quality and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

Building products with AI presents unique challenges, especially when transitioning from consumer applications to enterprise solutions and adapting user intuition to new paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

## Nuances of Enterprise Product Development
Developing enterprise AI solutions differs significantly from consumer products.
*   **Buyer vs. User**: Unlike consumer products, enterprise solutions must satisfy a buyer with specific goals, not just the end-users who will interact with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Timelines**: The pace of enterprise deployment is much slower, often taking months from initial conversation to actual deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the rapid iteration cycles common in consumer product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Feedback Mechanisms**: While consumer products rely on aggregated data science for feedback, enterprise solutions allow for direct communication with customers, providing more detailed insights into what works and what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Predictability**: Enterprise clients often require 60 days' notice before any product launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, a stark contrast to the rapidly evolving and often unpredictable nature of AI model development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Adapting to Non-Deterministic AI
Traditional computing relies on fixed technology bases where the same inputs yield the same outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. However, AI introduces a [[the_evolving_capabilities_and_future_potential_of_ai | non-deterministic user interface]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a> where computers can do new things every couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, and exact inputs may not always result in exact outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.
*   **Rapid Adaptation**: Despite this, humans show an incredible capacity to adapt quickly to new technologies, even those that initially seem magical, like self-driving cars or generative AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. What was mind-blowing two years ago can feel "dumb" today due to the rapid pace of improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
*   **Designing for Imperfection**: AI products often launch when they are 60% successful at a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. This necessitates designing with a "human in the loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, where the model can save time by doing most of the work, and the user can edit or refine the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. It's crucial for the model to communicate when it lacks confidence and needs human assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Varied Performance**: Models can perform exceptionally well on some tasks while struggling with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, leading to varied customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Eval Limitations**: Current models are often "eval limited" rather than "intelligence limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, meaning their full capabilities are not realized due to insufficient evaluation methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The importance of evaluating AI outputs becomes paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. [[ai_product_management_and_its_future | Product Managers]] must learn to write and use evaluations effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

## Educating End Users and Organizations
As AI solutions scale, educating users becomes critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **Product as Educator**: The product itself can be designed to be educational, guiding users on how to use new features and providing links to documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
*   **Change Management in Enterprise**: Educating entire organizations about productivity improvements from AI involves significant change management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.
*   **Power Users as Evangelists**: Identifying and empowering internal power users within organizations to act as evangelists and create custom solutions (like Custom GPTs) can make AI more accessible and valuable to less technical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.
*   **Agentic Capabilities**: The development of "computer use" features allows AI to perform repetitive data manipulation tasks, reducing "drudgery" and freeing humans for more creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.

## Evolving User-AI Interaction
[[human_interaction_and_personalization_with_ai_models | Human interaction and personalization with AI models]] is rapidly evolving:
*   **Proactivity**: Future models will become more proactive, monitoring user needs (with authorization), providing relevant recaps, and even drafting presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.
*   **Asynchronous Interaction**: Users will be able to initiate complex tasks and allow the AI to work asynchronously, freeing them to do other things while the model reasons or researches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. This breaks the constraint of expecting immediate answers and enables AI to handle larger "mini projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Multimodal Interaction**: AI models are expanding beyond text-based interaction to include voice and vision, enabling experiences like universal translation for business or travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.
*   **Developing Relationships**: Users, especially younger generations, are starting to interact with AI in more personal ways, viewing them almost as entities or friends, and expecting them to understand and respond to emotional depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. This leads to the "model behavior" becoming a critical aspect of product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

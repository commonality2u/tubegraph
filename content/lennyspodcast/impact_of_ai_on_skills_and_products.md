[[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI]] models are advancing at an unprecedented rate, with the current models being "the worst [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI]] model you will ever use for the rest of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. This rapid evolution means that every two months, computers gain new capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, requiring a complete rethinking of product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

## The Ever-Evolving Nature of [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI]] Models

Unlike traditional technology, where the underlying framework is largely fixed, [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI]] technology is in constant flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This rapid pace means that models are continuously improving, becoming smarter, faster, cheaper, and safer with each iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>. For example, the cost of using models has decreased by two orders of magnitude for significantly more intelligence in just a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>.

Developers and product builders are encouraged to continue building products "on the edge" of current model capabilities, anticipating that future models will enhance their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. This philosophy, termed "model maximalism," suggests that scaffolding around model imperfections is less critical because new, better models will soon overcome current limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

## [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | Impact]] on Product Development

### Changing Technology Landscape
[[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI]] fundamentally changes product development by introducing "fuzzier inputs and fuzzier outputs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Unlike traditional computing where defined inputs yield defined outputs, large language models (LLMs) excel at subtle, nuanced human language but don't always provide the exact same answer twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. The success rate of a model (e.g., 60% vs. 95% vs. 99.5%) dictates how a product must be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

### The [[the_role_of_ai_in_shaping_product_management_skills | Role of AI in Product Teams]]: Importance of Evals
Evaluating [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI]] models, or "evals," is becoming a core skill for product managers and builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. Evals are essentially quizzes or tests for models to gauge their proficiency in specific tasks or subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. Understanding model performance through evals is crucial for determining the appropriate product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

Evals are also integral to continuous learning processes, allowing teams to fine-tune models based on specific use cases. For example, in developing a deep research product, evals were designed simultaneously with the product to ensure the model improved in complex query handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. The quality of [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI]] is, in some ways, capped by the quality of evals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

### Iterative Deployment and Product Philosophy
OpenAI employs an "iterative deployment" philosophy, prioritizing rapid shipping and public iteration over perfect launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. This approach acknowledges that learning about models is a collective process, allowing the company and society to co-evolve with the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. Roadmaps are kept lightweight, as they are likely to change due to the fast-evolving technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

> "Plans are useless. Planning is helpful." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>

### [[role_of_ai_in_product_teams | Role of AI in Product Teams]]: Research and Product Collaboration
The relationship between research and product teams is evolving, moving towards a unified approach where product design and research work as a single team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. This collaborative model involves iterative feedback, understanding user problems, building evals, and using data to fine-tune models for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.

### Fine-Tuned Models and Ensembles
The [[future_implications_of_ai_for_product_management | future of AI]] product development will likely involve the widespread use of fine-tuned models and ensembles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. Fine-tuning involves providing models with numerous examples of desired behaviors to improve performance on specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. Ensembles combine different models—some specialized, some of varying sizes for latency or cost requirements—to tackle complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

> "A company is arguably an ensemble of models that have all been... fine-tuned and based on what we studied in college and what we have like learned over the course of our careers. We've all been fine-tuned to have different sets of skills and you like group them together in different configurations and the output of the ensemble is much better than the output of any one individual." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>

## [[the_role_of_ai_in_shaping_product_management_skills | Impact of AI on Skills]] and Roles

### The Role of Product Managers
In an [[the_role_of_ai_in_shaping_product_management_skills | AI era]], product management embraces a "PM light" philosophy, aiming for fewer but highly capable PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. Key traits for PMs include:
*   **High Agency**: Proactively identifying and solving problems without waiting for explicit direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Comfort with Ambiguity**: Operating effectively in environments where problems are ill-formed and solutions are continuously discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.
*   **Leading Through Influence**: Guiding teams and making decisive calls when necessary, especially amidst ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
*   **Product-Focused Engineers**: Relying on engineers to make decisions and be product-minded, reducing the need for micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>.

### Everyday [[influence_of_ai_on_engineering_productivity | AI Usage]] and "Vibe Coding"
Teams at OpenAI extensively use [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI]] for daily tasks like summarizing documents, writing specs, and even helping to write evals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>. "Vibe coding," a term describing the process of letting [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI]] (e.g., via tools like Cursor or GitHub Copilot) suggest code and rapidly accepting its suggestions, is transforming the engineering workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. This allows for quick prototyping and exploring ideas, potentially replacing traditional design tools like Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>.

### Future Product Teams and Essential Skills
The [[future_implications_of_ai_for_product_management | future of product teams]] will likely include "quasi researcher-machine learning engineer types" as part of every team, as fine-tuning models becomes a core workflow for building most products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>.

For children and future generations, key skills to foster in an [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI era]] are curiosity, independence, and self-confidence, along with the ability to think critically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.

## [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI]] and Human Interaction
A counterintuitive learning from building [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | AI]] products is that one can often reason about how a product should work by thinking about how a human would operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. For example, when a model needs to "think" for a few seconds, the user interface mimics human pauses and updates, rather than going silent or babbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

The chat interface, despite some skepticism, is an "amazing interface" for LLMs due to its versatility and universality, mirroring how humans communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. It offers maximum communication bandwidth and adapts to the complexity and nuances of human speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.

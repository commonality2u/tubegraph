Andrew Bosworth, or "Boz," currently serves as Meta's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. In this role, he leads Meta's extensive efforts in [[Developing AI products and utilizing technology | AR]], [[Developing AI products and utilizing technology | VR]], and mixed reality, overseeing consumer hardware products such as Quest, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Founding the AR/VR Organization
In 2017, Bosworth was instrumental in creating the company's AR/VR organization, now known as Reality Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. His leadership in this sector has been foundational to Meta's pursuit of future computing platforms.

## Quest Headsets and the Vision for Mainstream Adoption
Meta's Quest line of virtual reality headsets is a cornerstone of its AR/VR strategy. Bosworth believes that features like hand tracking and mixed reality are critical for these devices to become mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>. He has advocated for these technologies, even when teams considered them impossible to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

### Quest 3 vs. Apple Vision Pro
Comparing Meta's Quest 3 to Apple Vision Pro, Bosworth notes that Meta felt a "side of relief" upon the Vision Pro's release, as its internal technology did not represent a fundamental breakthrough apart from Apple silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. He argues that Quest 3 offers the "actual best headset," emphasizing value and specific performance aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

Key points of comparison:
*   **Resolution:** Apple Vision Pro excels in high-resolution movie watching when stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>.
*   **Pass-through:** The Vision Pro's pass-through is well-tuned for stationary, straight-ahead viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>.
*   **UI:** Apple has done a "tremendous job" with UI polish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **Eye Tracking:** Apple's eye tracking, though requiring prescription inserts, is commendable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.
*   **Hand Tracking:** Meta believes its hand tracking is superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Field of View:** The Apple Vision Pro has a significantly smaller field of view compared to Quest, which can be distracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.
*   **Display Brightness & Motion Blur:** Quest displays are brighter, and have less motion blur in mixed reality use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.
*   **Controllers:** Meta's inclusion of controllers expands usability, similar to how computers use both keyboard and mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.
*   **Cost:** The Quest 3 is significantly more affordable ($500) compared to the Vision Pro ($3500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>.
*   **Functionality:** Quest 3 supports remote desktop, allowing users to have multiple streamed monitors in [[Prototyping with AI Tools | work rooms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

Bosworth encourages users to try the Quest 3 themselves before forming an opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.

## Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses: Bridging AR with Everyday Life
Meta has also launched Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which are a significant step into practical AR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>. These glasses allow users to record experiences from their perspective, addressing the awkwardness of holding up a phone camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>.

A key [[the_evolving_capabilities_and_future_potential_of_AI | AI]] innovation in these glasses is the multimodal [[the_evolving_capabilities_and_future_potential_of_AI | AI]] assistant, which can use the camera to answer questions about the user's surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>. For example, it can identify a ski village and provide directions to amenities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. Future versions are rumored to have full AR capabilities, enabling features like displaying notes during speeches and controlling slides with gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>.

## Long-Term Investment in AI and Reality Labs
Meta has made two decade-long, large investment areas: [[the_evolving_capabilities_and_future_potential_of_AI | AI]] and Reality Labs (AR/VR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>. Despite market downturns and external criticism, Meta remains committed to these strategic investments. Bosworth emphasizes that cutting off future growth by solely focusing on the core business during tough times would be "committing itself to dying at some point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>. This long-term vision underpins Meta's ongoing [[Impact of AI on product development | product development]] in the AR/VR space.

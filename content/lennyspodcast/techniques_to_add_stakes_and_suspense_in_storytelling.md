To effectively engage an audience, stories must include "stakes," which refer to what the audience should be worried about, wanting for the storyteller, or wondering about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. If an audience isn't constantly wondering what will happen next, they are no longer listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Stakes are crucial for both formal presentations and everyday true-life stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

In the business world, many assume their audience is inherently interested, but this is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. The speaker assumes 100% of the time that no one wants to hear anything they have to say, which drives a relentless attempt to keep the audience wondering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

## Key Elements to Hold Audience Attention

There are four primary ways to keep people listening in any story, especially in business where audiences are less inherently engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>:
1.  **Stakes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>
2.  **Surprise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>
3.  **Suspense** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>
4.  **Humor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>

## Strategies to Insert Stakes

To effectively integrate stakes into a story, several techniques can be used:

### 1. The Elephant
This involves immediately establishing a significant element at the beginning of the story that creates worry or wonder for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
*   **Example:** In *Star Wars*, the film opens with a large spaceship shooting at a smaller one, immediately creating concern for the small ship, even before knowing who is on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. Similarly, an Alfred Hitchcock movie might start with a police officer chasing a man across a roof, where "something is at stake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   The "Elephant" does not necessarily have to be what the story is ultimately about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, but it serves to immediately engage the audience by making them wonder what will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.

### 2. The Backpack
This technique involves telling the audience the storyteller's plan or hopes *before* they carry it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. This allows the audience to "pack up" the storyteller's hopes and dreams with them, enabling them to react emotionally when the plan encounters difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **Example:** In *Ocean's Eleven* movies, the audience knows the plan before the characters execute it in the casino. This allows viewers to feel the tension and exclaim "oh no" when things go awry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.

### 3. Breadcrumbs
This involves offering small hints or partial information about what is happening without revealing the complete idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   **Example:** The classic example is placing a gun in a room; even if it seems irrelevant initially, the audience knows it will eventually "go off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. This creates an anticipation for what will happen next.

### 4. The Hourglass
When the audience is on the edge of their seat, about to discover what happens, the storyteller can "slow time down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. By loading the story with details, the storyteller prolongs the arrival of the next sentence, keeping the audience in suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.
*   **Example:** Quentin Tarantino's *Pulp Fiction* uses this, often delaying an anticipated violent moment with extended dialogue about trivial things, building suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.

### 5. Crystal Ball
This technique involves predicting a future outcome, often a terrible one, to plant a "false stake" in the audience's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Even if the prediction is not accurate, its realism can make the audience worry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
*   **Example:** In the anecdote about Eileen, the teacher could predict: "If I get this wrong Eileen's going to begin to cry; she's going to cry in front of 22 kids who for the rest of the year will continue to stare at this girl and remember the moment she cried" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. This immediately raises the stakes for the audience.

### Stakes Distribution
It is a mistake to frontload all stakes at the beginning of a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. Instead, stakes should continuously build throughout the story, with most occurring in the first half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. The second half should then be "the roller coaster to the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

## The Power of Surprise

Surprise is a "beautiful, delightful, amazing moment where the audience didn't see something coming and then it was almost like it was inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. A truly impactful surprise makes the audience realize *why* it happened, implying sufficient information was placed earlier in the story for it to be inevitable, yet the information was cleverly hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

> "Endings of books and movies always has to be both inevitable and also complete surprise." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>
> — David Mamet

Every story, especially those about personal change or realization, contains at least one moment of surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.

## Application in Business and Communication

Stakes and suspense are critical for [[crafting_compelling_presentations | crafting compelling presentations]] and [[role_of_storytelling_in_sales | sales]] pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. If businesses do not speak in story, their communication becomes forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. Our minds are not designed to remember pie charts, facts, or statistics unless they are attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

> "The risk you take if you're not telling stories is that you will be forgotten. 100%, you will be forgotten." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>

This applies to all forms of business communication, from investor pitches to internal team discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. By incorporating these [[visual_storytelling_techniques | storytelling techniques]], businesses can create positive connections and embed their message into people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>.

### Speaking with Adjacency
When trying to solve a problem or convey a message through a story, instead of matching content to content, match "theme, meaning, or message" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.
*   **Example:** A scientist promoting complex tubes found success by telling a story about the challenges of buying different types of apples for his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. The story's theme—"people deserve to get what they want in life"—then "snapped" over to the company's product, making it memorable and relatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. This approach generates curiosity and establishes a connection that pure data cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

By thinking about the feelings desired in the audience rather than just the content, storytellers can craft more impactful narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

In the field of data science and analytics, two critical traits that drive significant business impact are [[the_importance_of_authenticity_and_curiosity_in_leadership | curiosity]] and [[the_role_of_ownership_and_responsibility_in_product_management | ownership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Jessica Lax, VP of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, highlights these as essential for building a respected and impactful data team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## The Importance of Curiosity

Curiosity is considered an unteachable trait and a unique characteristic of top talent within data teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. It manifests as a self-motivation to "pull on the threads" and delve deeper into data, even after a direct question has been answered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. This proactive approach allows data professionals to identify potential anomalies or unexpected patterns and investigate them further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

### Identifying Curiosity in Hiring

Assessing curiosity during interviews can be challenging as it's a soft skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. One method is to include something subtly incorrect or "not quite right" within a business case presented to candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. The interviewer observes if the candidate notices the discrepancy, and if not, how they react and adapt their thinking when it's pointed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. Top candidates will often naturally provide examples from their past where their curiosity led them to investigate observations and uncover insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

### Curiosity Driving Impact

Proactive, self-directed deep dives, often stemming from [[the_importance_of_authenticity_and_curiosity_in_leadership | curiosity]], are crucial for discovering new opportunities and shaping future roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

#### Case Study: Referral Fraud at DoorDash
During a hackathon, a DoorDash data team investigated why the consumer referral channel, despite being active, showed below-average engagement and slow payback periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Rather than simply reducing spending on the channel, their curiosity led them to:
*   **Deep Dive:** They actively tried referring each other and even simulated referral fraud to understand how the system could be exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. This involved placing numerous cupcake orders using referral credits, as an order was required to claim the bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
*   **Uncover Bimodal Distribution:** They discovered that the channel's average performance was misleading. Instead, there was a bimodal distribution: one group consisted of high-quality consumers referring other valuable users, while another group engaged in fraudulent behavior by posting codes online solely for free discounts and credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
*   **Actionable Insights:** This led to critical recommendations, including implementing stricter fraud checks and caps on referrals, significantly improving the efficiency of the marketing channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## The Power of Ownership

[[the_role_of_ownership_and_responsibility_in_product_management | Ownership]] means that an analytics team's primary function is to drive business impact, not merely to serve as a query-answering or dashboard-building service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This involves having a strong point of view on decisions and answering "so what do we do now that we know this?" rather than just "why did this happen?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Instilling Ownership

This sense of extreme [[the_role_of_ownership_and_responsibility_in_product_management | ownership]] is deeply ingrained in DoorDash's culture, starting from its founder and CEO, Tony Xu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>. It's about a competitive desire to "win" and a willingness to "roll up your sleeves" and do whatever is necessary to solve a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

For a data scientist, this means their goal is to "figure out what's happening," even if it requires stepping outside traditional role boundaries. For example, a data scientist might pick up the phone and call customers to gather qualitative insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. This expectation of owning the outcome is continuously instilled in all team members, whether new or long-tenured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

#### Examples of Extreme Ownership
*   **Beyond Data:** A data scientist on an affordability initiative team, after quantitative data didn't fully explain why a feature wasn't working as expected, personally made phone calls to customers to understand their motivations and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. This direct qualitative research informed future decisions for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.
*   **Early Days Hustle:** In DoorDash's early days, despite their specific roles and compensation structures, employees, including a sales lead, would join the GM at 5 AM in winter to hand out promo codes and Kind bars to consumers at the Boston T, showing a shared commitment to growing the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.
*   **Customer-First Response:** During a major site outage, the entire early company (around 20 people) immediately shifted to customer support, answering phones, ensuring refunds, and delivering orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. Jessica, new to the company at the time, even personally picked up pizza for the office to feed the team doing support, rather than burdening the few active Dashers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. This reflects a commitment to doing "the right thing" by customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **WeDash Program:** All DoorDash employees participate in a "WeDash" program four times a year (often more), where they go out as Dashers or work in customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. This builds empathy with consumers, Dashers, and merchants, and helps identify product bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

### Fostering Cross-Functional Skills

Encouraging ownership allows team members to explore beyond their typical job descriptions, engaging in activities such as [[the_role_and_evolution_of_the_product_owner_in_tech | product management]] or engineering tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>. This exposure not only keeps the job interesting but also prepares individuals for transitions to other departments, contributing to the team being a "net importer of talent" from other parts of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. This diverse background creates a unique environment where colleagues can teach each other different skills, from financial modeling to statistics, fostering a well-rounded and adaptable team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.

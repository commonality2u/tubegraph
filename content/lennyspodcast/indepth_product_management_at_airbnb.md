Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, has shared his unique approach to [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product management]] and company leadership, which has caused a stir in the product world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. His methodology emphasizes clarity, alignment, and a deep involvement from leadership in product details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Reimagining Product Management at Airbnb

Chesky clarified that Airbnb did not eliminate the [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product management]] function entirely, but rather evolved its structure and responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. The changes include:
*   **Combined Responsibilities** The inbound responsibilities of a product manager were merged with the outbound (marketing) responsibilities of product marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. This means that those involved in building a product must also understand how to communicate about it and its market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.
*   **Offboarding Program Management Functions** Many program management tasks traditionally handled by product managers were transferred to dedicated program managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:13]</a>. At Airbnb, program management is now a high-status job, particularly for managing product launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*   **Smaller, More Senior Team** The product team became smaller and more senior, with a focus on experienced individuals who can manage by influence rather than direct control over design or engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
*   **Designers' Frustration** The initial impression that product management was eliminated led to cheers from designers, which Chesky attributes to a broader frustration among designers in Silicon Valley with the product development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. Many designers feel they are treated as a "service organization" rather than being integral to the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

### Why the Change?
Chesky observed that many companies, including early Airbnb, suffer from:
*   **Technical Debt and Dependencies** Different groups operating on disparate technical stacks, leading to accumulating technical debt and significant inter-team dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.
*   **Subdivision and Politics** Teams becoming "separate divisions" with their own marketing departments, fostering internal advocacy and politics for resources rather than company-wide collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy and Lack of Accountability** This subdivision leads to bureaucracy, difficulty in knowing who is doing what, and a lack of accountability, resulting in complacency and slower growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:07]</a>.
*   **Disconnection between Functions** A common issue is the disconnect between marketing and engineering, where new products are shipped but customers are not educated about them, leading to incremental development rather than significant innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

## Leadership Philosophy: CEO as Chief Product Officer
Chesky believes that the CEO of a product or tech company should essentially serve as the chief product officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>. His journey reflects a common founder cycle where initial direct involvement gives way to delegation, which can lead to "optimization work and small thinking" and eventually necessitates the founder taking back control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.

### Involvement in Details
Chesky emphasizes the importance of leaders being "in the details," distinguishing this from micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Being in the details, like a company board does with a CEO, allows leaders to ensure quality and understand performance, rather than simply telling people what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

### The Pandemic as a Catalyst
The COVID-19 pandemic, which led to an 80% loss of Airbnb's business in eight weeks, served as a "near-death business experience" that provided clarity and forced a return to core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>. This crisis allowed Chesky to implement radical changes, including:
*   **Centralized Project Management** Everything being done had to be written down and prioritized, drastically cutting the number of projects to focus on essential initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Management Layers & Functional Model** Layers of management were removed, and the company returned to a functional model (design, engineering, product marketing, communications, sales, operations) like a startup, rather than a divisional structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:00">[25:46:00]</a>.
*   **Fewer, More Senior Employees** A belief that adding more people slows projects down led to a focus on fewer, more senior employees, ensuring every executive is an expert in their functional domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>.
*   **Shared Consciousness and Decision-Making** Decision-making was pulled in, creating "one shared consciousness" among the top 30-40 people in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a>.
*   **Calendar-Driven Roadmap** Metrics became subordinate to the calendar, with a rolling two-year product roadmap updated every month, allowing for both long-term vision and rapid adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>.
*   **Two Major Product Launches Per Year** The company commits to two major launches annually (May and November/October), with all work explicitly on the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>.
*   **CEO Review Schedule** Chesky personally reviews all product and marketing work on a regular cadence (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly), allowing for immediate identification and resolution of bottlenecks and ensuring collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>.
*   **In-House Creative Agency** Built an in-house creative group for product and ad design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:00">[30:21:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Writing Functions** UX writing was combined with marketing writing to ensure a single, cohesive voice across all customer touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>.

## Growth and Product Strategy
Airbnb's shift moves away from relying heavily on traditional growth channels like paid growth (e.g., AdWords), which Chesky likens to a "laser" that lights up a corner but isn't an "investment" for accumulating advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. Instead, they are betting that building the best possible product and effectively telling people about it will drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:34:00">[34:34:00]</a>. This involves:
*   **[[product_management_and_storytelling | Storytelling]]**: Product managers are responsible for understanding the story of the product and how it will be communicated to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.
*   **Product Marketing as Education**: Marketing is seen as educating people on the unique benefits of new products being made and shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.
*   **Data, Research, and Intuition**: While data is used, it's balanced with research and intuition, emphasizing deep understanding over blind A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51:00">[36:51:00]</a>.
*   **Functional Reporting**: Ideally, engineering and design report directly to the product-led founder, with design not reporting under product unless the product person is also a designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>.
*   **Art and Science**: Product managers should combine art and science, being able to work effectively with both technical and non-technical functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>.

## Recent Product Launches
Airbnb's "Winter Release" is a culmination of these new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>.
*   **Guest Favorites**: This feature addresses the "Moment of Truth" problem where guests don't always know what they're going to get with a unique Airbnb listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27:00">[39:27:00]</a>. By analyzing 370 million reviews, customer service tickets, and host cancellation data, Airbnb identified the top two million homes ("guest favorites") that combine uniqueness with reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:16:00">[40:16:00]</a>.
*   **Overhauled Host Tab**: Recognising that a great guest experience starts with great hosts and tools, Airbnb completely redesigned the host tab, which serves as a "small business platform" for millions of hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:13:00">[41:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:06:00">[45:06:00]</a>.
    *   **[[AI in product management | AI-powered Photo Tour]]**: A new feature within the host tab uses an [[AI in product management | AI]] computer vision language, trained on 100 million photos, to scan and organize host photos by room automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:01:00">[44:01:00]</a>.
*   **New Design Aesthetic**: Airbnb is moving away from "flat design" towards a more three-dimensional, colorful aesthetic with texture and haptic feedback, believing this is where interface design is heading, partly influenced by [[AI in product management | AI]]'s ability to create more sophisticated interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>.

## [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | Leadership Insights]]: Driving Ambition and Avoiding Burnout

### "Add a Zero" Mentality
Chesky encourages teams to "add a zero" (10x) to their goals, not necessarily as a hard target, but as an exercise to prompt different thinking about problems. This pushes teams to understand problems deeply, break them into first principles, and find innovative solutions beyond current processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:56:00">[46:56:00]</a>.

### Setting the Pace and Decisive Action
A key [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | leadership]] role is setting the pace, which is governed by decisiveness and a bias for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:40:00">[47:40:00]</a>. By making fast decisions and immediately acting on them, teams can achieve significant work in shorter periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05:00">[48:05:00]</a>.

### Seeing Potential and Growth Mindset
A leader's job is to see potential in people they may not see in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:57:00">[48:57:00]</a>. Pushing a team should foster a "growth mindset," where challenges are seen as opportunities for improvement because the leader believes in the team's greater capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:20:00">[49:20:00]</a>.

### Work-Life Balance and Personal Growth
Ironically, Chesky found that being more deeply involved in product details eventually led to *more* personal time, as clarity and alignment reduced conflicts and surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:41:00">[50:41:00]</a>. His strategies for avoiding burnout include:
*   **Intentional Breaks**: Working intensely every other weekend, and prioritizing non-work time on alternate weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:20:00">[53:20:00]</a>.
*   **Physical Health**: Consistent exercise (daily cardio, gym sessions) and a healthy diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:35:00">[53:35:00]</a>.
*   **Healthy Relationships**: Actively maintaining strong relationships with friends and family, inspired by studies on human happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:02:00">[54:02:00]</a>.
*   **Proactive Prioritization**: Shifting from reacting to incoming requests to proactively prioritizing time based on strategic goals and meaningful relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:40:00">[56:40:00]</a>. This includes saying "no" to "fake work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:37:00">[57:37:00]</a>.
*   **Beginner's Mindset and Curiosity**: Continuously learning and maintaining a "beginner's mindset" to approach challenges with fresh eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:20:00">[59:20:00]</a>.
*   **Shamelessness in Asking for Help**: Recognizing that asking for help is an honor for others and a valuable way to learn from those slightly ahead in their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51:00">[01:00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Learning by Teaching**: Gaining insights through the act of teaching and advising others, such as Sam Altman of OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

### The Artist and Designer CEO
Chesky's background as an artist and industrial designer provides a unique perspective for leading Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51:00">[01:11:51:00]</a>. His early interest in design, architecture, and the intersection of art with manufacturing and sales (industrial design) shaped his approach to problem-solving and company building. Meeting his co-founder Joe Gebbia at Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) ultimately led to the founding of Airbnb, born from the need to pay rent by turning their house into a "bed and breakfast for a design conference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17:00">[01:06:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26:00">[01:10:26:00]</a>. This artistic and design intuition, imagination, and curiosity are qualities he believes more companies need at their helm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01:00">[01:12:01:00]</a>.

Tristan de Fontbelleau, co-creator of Ultra Speaking, offers a unique approach to improving public speaking skills through games and specific preparation methods, emphasizing enjoyment and real-time practice. His method moves beyond traditional learning to foster natural, conversational speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Why Games?

The fundamental principle is that one cannot improve at speaking without actively speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. Just as a cook refines intuition by cooking, public speakers must practice speaking to develop their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

Games are integral to Ultra Speaking's methodology for several reasons:
*   **Enjoyment**: Games are fun, making practice enjoyable and sustainable, preventing people from quitting after only a couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
*   **Short, Deliberate Practice**: They provide short, focused "reps" followed by immediate feedback, allowing for quick adjustments and internalizing lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
*   **Internalization over Cognition**: The goal is to move from conscious overthinking to a natural, subconscious flow state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, where speaking becomes second nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Creating Turbulence**: Games intentionally create challenging situations, similar to a flight simulator creating turbulence for a pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>. This highlights areas for improvement and helps speakers [[challenges_of_competitive_public_speaking | learn to recover gracefully from mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.
*   **Low Stakes Environment**: Practicing in low-stakes environments builds confidence, making real-world speaking engagements less daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.
*   **Mirroring Internal State**: The games act as a "mirror," reflecting one's comfort level and tendencies (e.g., comfortable with high energy vs. low energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.

## Key Public Speaking Exercises and Games

### Conductor
Conductor is a game designed to help speakers tap into different emotional states and energies to impact their words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.
*   **How it Works**: A random title is given, and the speaker begins talking. On-screen numbers (1-10) or a "breathe" prompt dictate the required energy level. The speaker must adjust their voice and demeanor to match the number, or pause completely for "breathe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Emotional Access**: Tapping into specific energies (e.g., 7 for high energy, 3 for calm) creates corresponding emotions, which naturally influence the words, ideas, and stories that emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.
    *   **Flexibility**: Encourages adaptability in delivery, enabling speakers to adjust their approach on the fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
    *   **Trust in Subconscious**: Demonstrates how the brain automatically generates content when the emotional state is aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.
    *   This game helps with [[practical_exercises_for_selfdiscovery_and_accountability | self-discovery and accountability]] by revealing personal comfort zones and "edges" in speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.

### Triple Step
Triple Step is a game designed to build resilience to distractions and maintain focus while speaking spontaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.
*   **How it Works**: The speaker is given a random speech title and must speak for a minute. During their speech, random words or phrases appear on screen, which they must seamlessly integrate into their ongoing narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Resiliency**: Trains the brain to stay composed even when unexpected elements are introduced, mirroring real-life distractions like audience yawns or dropped pens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.
    *   **Focus**: Reinforces the ability to maintain a clear direction despite external "turbulence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
    *   **Warm-up**: Excellent as a quick warm-up exercise before meetings, interviews, or podcasts, as it activates multiple parts of the brain needed for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.
    *   This exercise directly improves [[strategies_for_spontaneous_speaking | spontaneous speaking strategies]] by forcing on-the-spot adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

### Conviction Prompts
This exercise helps speakers cultivate executive presence and belief in their message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **How it Works**: The speaker is given a random topic and must speak about it. Instead of integrating words, they must integrate specific "conviction prompts" â€“ beginnings of sentences that force them to express stronger belief or certainty (e.g., "This matters a ton," "I genuinely believe that...") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Executive Presence**: Helps develop the gravitas and assurance associated with strong leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Authentic Belief**: Encourages speakers to genuinely connect with and stand behind their words and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.
    *   **Content Generation**: Prompts the brain to naturally complete sentences, leading to unanticipated insights and more impactful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>.

## Preparation Methods for Impactful Speeches

Beyond in-the-moment exercises, Ultra Speaking also offers methods for preparing talks that emphasize internalization and clarity.

### The Accordion Method
This method revolutionizes speech preparation by moving away from traditional scriptwriting and memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:17">[01:24:17]</a>.
*   **Old Way (Problematic)**: Dumping ideas on paper, arranging them, creating a script, and then memorizing it. This method is often "shitty and broken" as it leads to anxiety, loss of natural flow, and makes forgetting one line derail the entire speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.
*   **How it Works**:
    1.  **Down the Accordion**: Start by speaking your talk for a set time (e.g., 3 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. The only rules are to stay in character and end strong. Then, progressively reduce the time limit (e.g., 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds), forcing you to distill your message to its essential core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>. This process of elimination creates clarity on the core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:49">[01:29:49]</a>.
    2.  **Up the Accordion**: Once you have the "essential pieces" (the core message), go back up the time limits (e.g., another 30 seconds, then 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. This allows you to intentionally reintroduce supportive content and examples, building on the clarified core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Internalization, Not Memorization**: The repetition and compression/expansion process deeply internalizes the speech, making it flexible and less prone to disruption from forgetting a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>.
    *   **Clarity and Intentionality**: Ensures every element of the speech is purposefully chosen and contributes to the core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a>.
    *   **Adaptability**: Allows speakers to easily adjust their talk for different time frames (e.g., 1 minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:27">[01:32:27]</a>.
    *   The Accordion Method is a powerful tool for [[techniques_for_developing_impactful_speeches | developing impactful speeches]] by fostering clarity and natural delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>.

### Bow and Arrow Technique
This technique focuses on prioritizing what the audience will remember above what the speaker wants to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>.
*   **Mindset Shift**: Instead of focusing on what you *want* to say, focus on the *one thing* you want your audience to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:46">[01:38:46]</a>.
*   **The "Arrow"**: This is the single, core sentence or idea that, if your audience remembers nothing else, you would be satisfied with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:30">[01:39:30]</a>. It acts as a "North Star" for the entire talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.
*   **The "Bow"**: These are the supporting elements (anecdotes, data points, stories, emotions) that add weight and impact to the "arrow," pulling it back to launch with force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Audience Focus**: Ensures the talk is built around the audience's retention, not just the speaker's desire to convey information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>.
    *   **Extreme Clarity**: Forces conciseness and clear messaging, making the talk more impactful and memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47">[01:41:47]</a>.
    *   **Reduced Preparation**: By focusing on one key takeaway and its supports, speakers need less memorization and can feel more confident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:17">[01:43:17]</a>.
    *   This technique is especially helpful for [[public_speaking tips_for_storytellers | storytellers]] by ensuring narratives serve a clear, central message.

## Practical Advice and General Tips

*   **Speak Conversationally**: Avoid entering a "public speaking voice" which tends to be stiff and professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Speaking conversationally is more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Enjoyment as a Barometer**: If speaking feels unenjoyable, it's a sign that something is being done wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. True communication should be enjoyable and rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Look Up When Thinking**: Instead of looking down (which can signal uncertainty or note-reading), look up when gathering thoughts. This makes you appear thoughtful and confident, reducing the likelihood of interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>.
*   **End Strong**: People tend to "end weak" by trailing off or expressing doubts at the conclusion of their statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>. Anticipate this tendency and ensure a clear, confident landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. Using "summary prompts" like "so to wrap up..." can guide your brain to a strong finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>.
*   **Stay in Character**: Do not "leak" insecurities or self-sabotage by vocalizing perceived mistakes or nervousness. The audience often cannot see what you feel, and breaking character forces a negative lens on your presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:23">[02:22:23]</a>. Maintain a confident demeanor throughout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:07">[02:48:07]</a>. This advice relates directly to [[practical_advice_for_reducing_nerves_in_public_speaking | practical advice for reducing nerves in public speaking]].
*   **"Think Out Loud"**: Rather than overthinking and controlling every word, practice "thinking out loud." This allows the subconscious to make connections and deliver words more naturally, akin to [[strategies_for_spontaneous_speaking | spontaneous speaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>.
*   **Speaking as a Meta-Skill**: Improving speaking is a [[transformative_nature_of_improving_public_speaking_skills | transformative meta-skill]], like fitness. Breakthroughs in speaking can positively impact all areas of life, including work, friendships, and family relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Humans are Evolved to Speak**: Everyone possesses the "hardware" for speaking. Over time, "bugs in the software" (self-consciousness, anxiety) develop. The goal is to debug and upgrade this software to unleash one's natural speaking superpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

By engaging with these exercises and internalizing these principles, individuals can move beyond the anxieties often associated with [[techniques_to_manage_public_speaking_anxiety | public speaking]] and harness their inherent communication abilities.

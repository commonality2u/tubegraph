Impact is considered the most important factor for success and growth in product management, as it directly correlates with career advancement and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The more impact a product manager drives, the more independence and scope they are given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Defining Impact for Product Managers

For a product manager, impact primarily involves:
*   **Driving Clarity** Understanding where product problems and opportunities lie, and establishing the right focus and prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This includes creating the clarity needed for people to believe in a product investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Delivering Results** Showing the ability to make quick progress and deliver "fast lane wins," as well as medium and slow lane wins. Consistently demonstrating this delivery validates a product manager's ability to identify opportunities and act on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## The Impact Equation: Environment x Skills

Impact is achievable by considering two sets of variables: those related to the environment and those related to an individual's skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Environment Variables
The environment consists of six key variables that influence a product manager's ability to have impact:
1.  **Manager** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>: A manager is the most critical environmental factor, as a great manager can help address issues with resources, scope, team, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Managers can move "chest pieces around" to fix various issues over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
2.  **Resources** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>: The type and adequacy of the team, and available budget/P&L <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
3.  **Scope** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>: The extent of a product manager's responsibilities and remit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. If scope is too limited, it can hinder focus on important tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Sometimes, too much scope can also be problematic, leading to burnout and difficulty in execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:15:18]</a>.
4.  **Team** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>: The skills and capabilities of the team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
5.  **Compensation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>: Feeling fairly compensated is important for finding meaning in the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
6.  **Company Culture** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>: Whether the culture is supportive, inclusive, and allows for best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Product managers should annually assess and score each of these variables to identify areas limiting their impact and where they can influence change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Honesty in this evaluation is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

### Skills Variables
Key skills that contribute to a product manager's impact include:
1.  **Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>: Often the most impactful skill, as effective communication can lead to perceived success even with poor execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. It's not just about speaking, but also about listening to effectively communicate back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.
2.  **Influence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
3.  **Leadership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
4.  **Strategic Thinking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
5.  **Execution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>: The ability to get things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

To improve skills, it's recommended to be a voracious reader of industry content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>, build a "stable of mentors" (three or four people meeting monthly) to ensure continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, and observe how others "hone their craft" and lead teams in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

## Driving Impact through "Understand Work"

A crucial strategy for increasing impact and accelerating growth is to invest in "understand work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This concept, adopted from Facebook's "Understand, Identify, Execute" framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, involves intentionally dedicating time to gain clarity and de-risk projects before execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

The "anti-pattern" is to "identify, justify, execute" – building something based on an initial idea, then pulling data to justify it, often leading to unimpactful results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Instead, the correct sequence emphasizes understanding first principles of what is truly happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

### How "Understand Work" Drives Impact
*   **De-risking Projects**: It's an intentional effort to learn and mitigate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Clarifying Root Causes**: Helps clarify root causes, "jobs to be done," and the right use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Velocity Multiplier**: By pursuing "understand work" in parallel with execution (e.g., executing on high-conviction items while researching others), teams gain clarity and de-risk new ideas, leading to faster, more effective execution and a higher win rate for shipped features over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Teams might start with a 60% execution/40% understand work mix, shifting to 80-85% execution as understanding grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

Understand work can be done by all functions:
*   **Engineering** might refactor code for scalability or instrument data for visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Data Science** might analyze activation metrics or proxy metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **Product Management** might define partnership strategies or dog-food the experience from different user perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

This approach is counter-intuitive for those focused on "move faster, ship more" but ultimately leads to greater impact and faster growth by executing more intelligently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. It transforms growth from an overnight success mentality to a series of short-term wins that contribute to longer-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

### Applying "Understand Work": Case Studies

*   **Instagram Onboarding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>: Initially, Instagram's signup flow lacked detailed logging. The team dedicated time to instrument the funnel, understand user drop-offs, and identify broken areas, combining this with quick tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Instagram Account Access** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>: Millions of users were churning due to inability to log back in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. Research in South Asia revealed users often shared phones or used prepaid plans, necessitating easy log-out/log-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Solutions like an "Omni-box" for email/phone/handle input and a "save credentials" prompt led to a significant increase of 15-20 million monthly active users per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>. This further led to the discovery of users creating multiple accounts, prompting the development of seamless account switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>.
*   **Facebook Friend Recommendations in India** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>: Facebook's friend recommendations in India were "broken," with users having fewer common friends compared to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:11">[01:26:11]</a>. On-the-ground "understand work" revealed that Western-centric profile fields (like school, job title) were irrelevant for many Indian users, who often had common names like "Amit Kumar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>. Users would look at photos instead of profiles to identify friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>. This cultural context was crucial to understanding the problem.

## The Adjacent User Theory and Flywheels

To drive impact and growth, especially in hypergrowth products, it's crucial to understand the "adjacent user" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding Current and Next Users**: While knowing current users is important, predicting and understanding the *next* user — the one who *could* be using the product but isn't due to specific barriers — is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Dogfooding as the Adjacent User**: Product teams should actively use the product from the perspective of this new, "adjacent" user. This often reveals a significantly worse experience compared to a power user's experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>.
*   **Addressing Cohort Decline**: When new user cohorts show declining retention curves (e.g., after three to six months) without product changes, it indicates that the product's current design isn't meeting the needs of a new user segment (e.g., less tech-savvy users, or those in different markets with different phone types) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

Examples of applying adjacent user theory:
*   **Instagram's Growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>: As Instagram rapidly grew, the typical user persona changed. The team had to continually adapt the product for newer users who might have different tech savviness or cultural contexts than early adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
    *   **Connections Pivot**: Early Instagram prioritized celebrity follows, but this led to retention issues for average users whose first posts weren't seen by friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. A "connections pivot" prioritized connecting new users with real-life friends, significantly boosting retention by ensuring new users felt validated and part of a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.
    *   **Multi-pronged Growth Strategy**: Beyond word-of-mouth invitations, Instagram leveraged celebrity partnerships (teaching celebrities to use the platform as personal brands) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>, which fueled SEO (news articles linking to Instagram profiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. The launch of a web presence also significantly contributed to SEO and international growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>. These multiple "growth engines" compounded each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.
*   **Instacart User Experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>: For Instacart, the "job to be done" for a user isn't just "buying groceries," but often "making a meal" (e.g., "I want to buy tacos") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Realizing Instacart made it difficult to reorder items (a common user behavior) led to significant improvements by streamlining the process and making reordering entire past lists or specific items easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

## Impact in Product Management and Career Growth

Product managers can foster their [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | career growth]] by focusing on impact:
*   **Understanding the "DNA" of the Company**: When joining a new company, it's crucial to understand its core "DNA" – what it truly values and needs (e.g., strong operations vs. strategic vision). Misalignment can hinder impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>. It's helpful to speak with former employees for an unfiltered perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>.
*   **Coaching Mindset**: Product leadership is a "team sport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:56">[01:51:56]</a>; leaders act as coaches, enabling team members to maximize their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>. This includes building a "coaching tree" by helping direct reports grow into next-level roles, which ultimately benefits the leader and the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:58">[01:52:58]</a>.
*   **Managing Complex Change**: When joining a team to improve its culture or speed, the "Managing Complex Change" framework is useful. It posits that change requires Vision, Skills, Incentives, Resources, and an Action Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Missing any component leads to specific negative outcomes (e.g., missing skills leads to anxiety, missing incentives leads to resistance, missing an action plan leads to false starts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Leaders can diagnose the team's struggles to identify which "levers" to pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Bloom's Taxonomy**: Borrowed from education, Bloom's Taxonomy (Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, Evaluation) helps diagnose where team members are struggling in their critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This allows leaders to meet people where they are and provide targeted support to fill skill gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Empathy and Connection**: Taking time in the first 90 days to sit in on team meetings, listen, and get to know individuals by name and story (professional and personal) fosters trust and makes them more receptive to leadership guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>. This emphasis on human connection and valuing diverse voices is critical for building world-class, scalable products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

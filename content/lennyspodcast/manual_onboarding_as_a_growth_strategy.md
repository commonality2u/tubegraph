Manual onboarding, specifically one-to-one concierge onboarding, can be a highly effective, albeit unconventional, growth strategy for startups, particularly in their early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:47">[04:47:47]</a>. Rahul Vora, founder and CEO of Superhuman, discusses how his company utilized this approach for years before transitioning to self-service.

## The Superhuman Approach

In its early days, Superhuman insisted on one-to-one concierge onboarding for every new user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:47">[04:47:47]</a>. Users could not access Superhuman without going through this personalized experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. At its peak, Superhuman had approximately 20 people dedicated to manual onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

## Why Manual Onboarding Works

Rahul Vora highlights two primary reasons why manual onboarding was the "absolute right thing to do" for Superhuman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:18">[04:49:18]</a>:

1.  **Superior User Metrics**: Manual onboarding significantly boosted key user metrics such as engagement, retention, product market fit score, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:54">[04:55:54]</a>. This approach allowed Superhuman to:
    *   **Cultivate a Strong Brand**: By personally guiding users, the company fostered an early cohort of "super fans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:52">[05:14:52]</a>. This directly contributed to authentic word-of-mouth growth, which Rahul believes is the "true secret" behind virality, rather than relying solely on viral mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Achieve Remarkable Quality**: This hands-on method ensured users deeply understood and appreciated the product, leading to "delight" and "remarkable quality" that encouraged sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.
2.  **Strategic Resource Allocation**: In an environment with accessible funding (e.g., the zero-interest rate phenomenon era), manual onboarding allowed Superhuman to:
    *   **Prioritize Product Development**: Engineers could focus almost entirely on finding product market fit, or [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | solution deepening]] (making the product better for existing users), and later [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | market widening]] (making it available to more users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Defer First-Time User Experience (FTUE) Development**: By having humans handle user [[improving_user_activation_and_onboarding_experiences | activation and onboarding]], the company avoided spending significant engineering resources on self-service flows, especially for a product that might not ultimately achieve product market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Other companies, in contrast, sometimes allocated nearly half their engineering budget to such flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

## When to Stop Manual Onboarding

While powerful, manual onboarding is not a permanent solution. The decision to transition away from it is crucial for continued growth and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

Rahul identifies key factors for when to stop:

*   **User Preferences**: Some personality types simply do not want a one-on-one onboarding experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. At a certain point, these users become significant to the target market, necessitating a world-class self-service option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **Market Width**: When the "top of funnel width" expands to a point where manually onboarding every user is no longer feasible (e.g., for enterprise clients or a broader range of "prosumers"), self-service becomes a necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Viability**: While manual onboarding can be financially viable (Superhuman "always made money doing onboarding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>), it needs to align with the customer's lifetime value (LTV) and average contract value (ACV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

Building a robust self-service experience after years of manual onboarding can be challenging due to the company's ingrained DNA around the manual process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. However, with persistence, it's achievable, allowing the company to serve a broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Today, almost every new Superhuman customer uses self-service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

The experience of manual onboarding and later transitioning to self-service demonstrates a deliberate strategy to focus on core product value and brand building early on, leveraging human interaction to drive strong [[Onboarding and activation metrics in tech | activation metrics]] before scaling through automated processes.

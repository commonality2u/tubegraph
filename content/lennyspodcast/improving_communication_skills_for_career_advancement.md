Improving communication skills is a significant factor in [[career_development_and_progression_strategies | career development and progression]]. Speaking well is considered a "superpower" in one's career, essential for activities like interviewing, excelling in meetings, pitching ideas to managers, and leading teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:48">[01:37:48]</a>. This skill becomes even more critical as individuals advance in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:56">[01:47:56]</a>. The good news is that communication is a skill that can be developed and improved with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:39">[01:50:39]</a>. Matt Abrahams, a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and author of "Think Faster, Talk Smarter," emphasizes that taking the time to work on communication is critically important, not just for personal benefit but also for helping others by effectively sharing one's voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

## Key Areas of Improvement

The two main areas individuals often seek help with in communication are:
1.  Reducing anxiety before and during public speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>.
2.  Getting better at speaking on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:38">[01:28:38]</a>.

## Reducing Public Speaking Anxiety

Anxiety is a common experience when communicating in front of others; it is considered innate to being human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>. Understanding that others, including experienced speakers, also feel nervous can help normalize this feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:04">[01:55:04]</a>. Improvement is a process, not a sudden transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:48">[02:21:48]</a>.

### Recommended Techniques

*   **Visualization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>: Instead of picturing the audience naked (which is considered bad advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:07">[06:27:07]</a>), visualize yourself in the speaking environment, delivering the presentation, and the audience responding positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:11">[06:56:11]</a>. This "dress rehearsal" desensitizes individuals and builds confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:13">[08:52:13]</a>. It can be a short, 5-minute exercise involving deep breathing to calm the body and mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:47">[09:50:47]</a>.
*   **Strive for Connection Over Perfection / "Dare to Be Dull"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>: This concept, originating from improvisation, encourages being present and collaborative rather than aiming for perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:28">[11:17:28]</a>. By daring to be "dull" — simply answering the question or engaging in small talk — you reduce self-evaluation and free up cognitive resources for connecting with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:17">[12:46:17]</a>. This often leads to better and more insightful communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:22">[13:04:22]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Reframing (Excitement)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>: Reframe anxiety symptoms as excitement. The body's physiological arousal for anxiety and excitement are similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:43">[14:29:43]</a>. By labeling it as excitement ("This is exciting! I get to share my point of view!"), you prompt relaxation and are perceived as communicating better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:22">[15:17:22]</a>.
*   **Mantras** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>: Combat negative self-talk by repeating a positive mantra, such as "I have value to add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>, "You've got this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>, or "It's not about me, it's about my content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">[01:38:38]</a>. Writing it down or setting phone reminders can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>.
*   **Present-Oriented Techniques** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:33">[02:47:33]</a>: Since much anxiety stems from fear of future negative outcomes, engaging in activities that bring you to the present moment helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:18">[02:50:18]</a>.
    *   **Tongue Twisters**: Saying tongue twisters aloud (e.g., "I slit a sheet, a sheet I slit, and on that slitted sheet I sit") warms up the voice and requires focus on the present, distracting from nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>.
    *   **Swearing**: Research suggests that cursing can release neurochemicals that blunt anxiety and reduce pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:50">[03:06:50]</a>.
*   **Breathing Techniques**: Deep belly breathing slows the heart rate, normalizes voice tone, and reduces shakiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>. The key is to make the exhale longer than the inhale, ideally twice as long (e.g., inhale for 3 counts, exhale for 6 counts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:08">[02:17:08]</a>. Some techniques involve a "double inhalation" (inhale fully, then sneak in a little extra air) followed by a long exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:32">[02:40:32]</a>.
*   **Frame Presentations as Conversations**: Many people are more comfortable in conversation than presenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:46">[02:05:46]</a>. Structure presentations as conversations (e.g., "Today I have three questions I'd like to answer...") to reduce anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:25">[02:25:25]</a>.
*   **Audience Distraction**: Initially, shift attention away from yourself. This doesn't mean tangents, but relevant actions like asking a question, telling a story, or showing a video, allowing you to calm down before taking center stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:20">[02:36:20]</a>.

## Improving On-the-Spot Speaking

Most public speaking is spontaneous, occurring in situations like Q&As, toasts, or giving feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>.

### Core Principles
*   **Anyone Can Improve**: The fundamental truth is that anyone can get better at spontaneous speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Prepare to Be Spontaneous**: Like athletes or jazz musicians who practice extensively, preparing in advance is crucial for spontaneous performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:11">[03:51:11]</a>.
*   **Address Mindset and Messaging**: Improvement involves both a shift in mindset (approach) and the strategic crafting of messages (structure and focus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:53">[03:50:53]</a>.

### The Importance of Structure

When speaking spontaneously, the intense pressure can lead to simply "spewing out" information in lists, which is difficult for brains to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:33">[03:56:33]</a>. Structure provides a logical beginning, middle, and end, making information digestible and memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:34">[03:58:34]</a>. It's like having a recipe, reducing the burden of figuring out "how to say it" and allowing focus on "what to say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:43">[03:59:43]</a>.

#### Useful Structures:
*   **Problem-Solution-Benefit**: Common in advertising, this structure identifies a problem, offers a solution, and explains the benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:48">[04:02:48]</a>.
*   **PREP (Point, Reason, Example, Point)**: State your main point, provide a reason, give an example, and then restate your point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:58">[04:09:58]</a>.
*   **What, So What, Now What**:
    *   **What**: The product, service, update, or feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:48">[04:14:48]</a>.
    *   **So What**: Why is this important or relevant to the audience, company, or clients? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:35">[04:17:35]</a>
    *   **Now What**: What comes next or what action is suggested? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:44">[04:23:44]</a>
    This structure is excellent for broader presentations, updates, or feedback sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:23">[04:53:23]</a>.

### Practice and Feedback

To make these structures familiar and accessible, use them regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:42">[04:46:42]</a>. For example, after listening to a podcast or reading something, reflect on it using the "What, So What, Now What" structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:23">[04:53:23]</a>. Improving communication, whether spontaneous or planned, relies on:
*   **Repetition**: Consistent practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:01">[04:42:01]</a>.
*   **Reflection**: Thinking about what worked or didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:05">[04:47:05]</a>.
*   **Feedback**: Getting input from others, as we are not always the best judges of our own communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:57">[04:50:57]</a>.

#### Resources for Practice:
*   [[Toastmasters | Toastmasters]]: A great organization for getting "reps" (repetitions) in public speaking, including specific "table topics" for on-the-spot speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:48">[04:40:48]</a>.
*   **Improvisation Classes**: Helps develop comfort with being present and collaborative in communication, without the pressure of being funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:47">[04:48:47]</a>.
*   **University Continuing Studies/Extension Classes**: Many universities offer communication classes open to the public, often virtually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:16">[04:52:16]</a>.
*   **Books, Podcasts, Blogs, Videos**: Useful for learning techniques, but true improvement comes from applying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:09">[04:55:09]</a>.

## Specific On-the-Spot Situations

### Small Talk

Small talk often has a bad reputation but is crucial for forming and fostering relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:09">[04:50:09]</a>.
*   **Be Interested, Not Interesting**: Focus on setting the other person up to be successful by asking questions and listening, rather than trying to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:55">[04:56:55]</a>.
*   **Comparable Levels of Disclosure**: In small talk, there should be a balance in the depth of personal disclosure over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:36">[04:58:36]</a>. Avoid over-disclosing too quickly, but also share about yourself when appropriate; otherwise, it can feel awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:58">[04:59:58]</a>.
*   **Supporting vs. Shifting Responses**: Aim for more "supporting responses" (asking questions that encourage the other person to continue talking about their topic) than "shifting responses" (turning the conversation to yourself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:01">[04:57:01]</a>.

### Giving Feedback

Feedback should be viewed as an opportunity to problem-solve collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:50">[05:52:50]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-Validation**: Refrain from saying "Good question" to every question or "Does that make sense?" repeatedly, as it can sound insincere or imply uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:07">[06:03:07]</a>. Instead, ask "Did I answer your question?" or "Can I tell you more?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:54">[06:03:54]</a>.
*   **Use the What, So What, Now What Structure**: This can be effectively used for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
    *   **What**: Describe the specific behavior or situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:07">[06:07:07]</a>.
    *   **So What**: Explain the impact or consequence of that behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:44">[06:07:44]</a>.
    *   **Now What**: Suggest a specific action or next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:24">[06:08:24]</a>.
*   **Four I's Structure**:
    *   **Information**: Set the context for the feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:52">[05:53:52]</a>.
    *   **Impact**: Share the impact of the behavior on you, the feedback giver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:02">[05:59:02]</a>.
    *   **Invitation**: Invite the other person to collaborate on the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:27">[06:00:27]</a>.
    *   **Implications/Consequences**: Discuss the benefits of addressing the issue or the consequences of not doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:54">[06:00:54]</a>.

### Giving Toasts and Tributes

Toasts are frequent public speaking events, occurring in both social and work contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:55">[05:52:55]</a>.
*   **WHAAAT Acronym**:
    *   **W**hy are we here?: State the purpose of the gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:27">[05:54:27]</a>.
    *   **H**ow are you connected?: Briefly explain your relationship to the event or person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:42">[05:57:42]</a>.
    *   **A**necdote: Share a relevant and concise story or example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
    *   **A**nd, **A**nd, **T**hanks: Express gratitude or give a final salutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:30">[06:03:30]</a>.
*   **Be Brief**: Nobody complains about a toast being too short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:01">[06:05:01]</a>.
*   **Be Emotional (Show, Don't Tell)**: Genuine emotion connects with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:44">[06:10:44]</a>. Convey emotion through anecdotes and stories, rather than simply stating feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:17">[06:19:17]</a>.
*   **Test It Out**: For important toasts, practice and get feedback from a few people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:06">[06:27:06]</a>.

### Q&A Sessions

Approach Q&A as an opportunity to extend, expand, connect, and learn, rather than a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:07">[06:07:07]</a>.
*   **ADD (Answer, Detailed example, Describe relevance)**:
    *   **A**nswer: Respond to the question cleanly and concisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.
    *   **D**etailed example: Provide a specific example to reinforce your answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
    *   **D**escribe relevance: Explain why your answer is significant or relevant to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
    This structure helps connect the dots for the audience, as common sense is not always common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

### Apologizing

*   **Take Responsibility**: Apologize for the specific transgression, not for how the other person feels (e.g., "I'm sorry that *you* feel bad" is not a true apology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
*   **AAA (Acknowledge, Appreciate, Amend)**:
    *   **A**cknowledge: Clearly state what you did wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.
    *   **A**ppreciate: Show understanding of the difficulty or impact you caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
    *   **A**mend: Propose a specific action you will take to remedy the situation or prevent it from happening again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Improving communication skills is a vital aspect of [[career_growth_and_personal_development | career growth and personal development]]. It requires initiative, self-compassion, and time, but ultimately allows individuals to improve their communication and effectively share their voice with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:02">[07:10:02]</a>.

Claire V., a veteran Chief Product Officer and two-time founder, emphasizes that her role in later-stage companies is often not to teach them to operate like big companies, but rather to remind them they can still operate [[transition_from_large_company_to_startup | like a startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach aims to achieve both speed and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Cultivating a Fast Pace

To maintain a fast pace within larger organizations, Claire implements several concrete practices:

*   **Avoid Calendar-Driven Pace**
    Organizations often let their pace align with the calendar, especially recurring meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Claire prevents this by pushing for immediate discussion and decision-making instead of deferring to the next scheduled meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Decisions should be made based on real-time needs and information, not artificial meeting cadences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.

*   **Set "One Click Faster" Expectations**
    Claire communicates to her leaders the expectation to accelerate the "clock speed" by one click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. This means if a task is planned for "this year," it should be done "this half"; if for "this half," then "this quarter," and so on, down to "today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. This explicit expectation helps shift mindsets and increases organizational momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

*   **Maintain a Fast Personal SLA**
    As a leader, Claire ensures she is never the bottleneck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. She strives to be highly responsive in decision-making, tie-breaking, and approvals, allowing the rest of the organization to move quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

## Upholding a High Bar for Quality

A high bar for quality involves two main areas: talent and product.

*   **Defining and Maintaining a High Talent Bar**
    *   **Specific Career Ladders:** It's crucial to define the talent bar with specific and measurable career ladders, especially at senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. This allows for clear assessment of whether individuals are meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
    *   **Normalizing Feedback:** Transparent and candid feedback is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Avoiding conflict and honest feedback leads to degradation of the talent bar, as expectations are unclear and accountability is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. Claire advocates for "clear is kind," making it explicit when performance doesn't meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
    *   **Addressing Poor Fits Quickly:** When individuals are not a good fit for a role or organization, it's important to move quickly to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. This maintains a healthy, effective, and high-performing team environment for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

*   **Focusing on the Product Bar**
    While the transcript doesn't detail specific product bar strategies, the implication is that with a fast pace and high talent, the product quality naturally follows.

## The Rise of the CPT+O Role

Claire's current role as a CPT+O (Chief Product and Technology Officer) combines product, engineering, and design functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. She believes this role could be rising due to several factors:

*   **Technical Proficiency:** A CPT+O must be technical, understanding how software is built to drive value through a highly performing engineering team and a scalable platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.
*   **Operational Acumen:** The role is highly operational, requiring expertise in operations and organization design, particularly for larger engineering teams with distinct talent and cultural challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.
*   **Optimizing for the Whole:** Bringing product, engineering, and design under one leader optimizes for the entire "capital P" product, rather than individual functional silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>. This ensures debates are about what's best for the organization and customers, not just individual departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.
*   **CEO Leverage:** This combined role provides significant leverage to the CEO, as a single person is responsible for the company's often expensive and complex R&D investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

The concept aligns with the idea that [[innovating_within_large_companies | organizations are fluid]] and can be structured around talented, motivated individuals, rather than strict, unchangeable structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. This approach enables a company to "bend the universe to its will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, adapting to market needs and talent strengths.

Claire also notes that early-stage startup experience can provide a "shortcut" to developing the breadth of functional skills necessary for roles like the CPT+O, as founders often have to perform many roles initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. This fosters a mindset where "there are no lanes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>, encouraging cross-functional collaboration and contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

The United States has seen a notable trend of Indian-born immigrants rising to CEO positions in major technology and other industries. Companies like Microsoft, Adobe, Alphabet, IBM, Palo Alto Networks, and even Starbucks have been led by CEOs born in India who later immigrated to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This demographic might be the largest ethnic group of tech CEOs in the US, apart from white males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to Success

Several factors are believed to contribute to the significant success of Indian immigrants in US business and technology:

*   **Hunger and Drive** Immigrants often carry a "chip on the shoulder" due to the struggles faced in leaving their home country and striving for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Many come from humble backgrounds with no initial money, fueling a strong hunger for achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This concept of having a "chip on the shoulder" driving success is a common theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.
*   **Appreciation for Math and Logic** Indian society historically emphasizes and appreciates mathematics and logic, leading to a high number of engineering graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Professions like engineering and medicine hold high status, requiring individuals to pass difficult exams, which acts as a significant filtering criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Adherence to Dharma (Principles of Founders)** Many successful CEOs, particularly those of Indian origin, are seen as excelling because they closely follow the original principles or "Dharma" set by the founders of their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. They prioritize sustaining and growing the established vision rather than imposing their own identity or diluting the foundational values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This approach is linked to a humility that acknowledges the purity of the initial creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. This aligns with the concept of [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | Level 5 Leadership]], where leaders prioritize the business over personal legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.
    *   **Indian Mythology Archetypes** Kunal Shah, drawing from Indian mythology, explains this through the roles of Brahma (creation), Shiva (destruction), and Vishnu (sustenance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Founders are seen as Brahma and Shiva, while CEOs often embody Vishnu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
        *   **Krishna:** High on values, low on obedience – represents the entrepreneurial spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
        *   **Rama:** High on values, high on obedience – represents adherence to principles and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
        *   Successful Indian CEOs are adept at balancing both Krishna and Rama archetypes, adapting as needed while staying true to core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This dynamic is an inevitable cycle of growth and destruction in business, similar to the Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh cycles in mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Orientation** Indian culture tends to foster a long-term mindset. This is exemplified by phenomena like the high rate of arranged marriages (95%) and very low divorce rates (less than 1%) in India, which reflect a focus on long-term values over short-term attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This long-term thinking helps cultures endure for millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

## Cultural and Market Nuances in India

Building products and businesses in India presents unique challenges and opportunities distinct from Western markets:

*   **DAUs vs. ARPUs**: India is characterized by high daily active users (DAUs) but low average revenue per user (ARPU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
    *   This is primarily due to the country's lower per capita income (around $2,500 per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
    *   India offers extremely cheap data and high smartphone penetration, making it attractive for global companies seeking user growth for valuation purposes, even if monetization is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
    *   Companies like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon Prime have struggled to achieve high ARPU in India due to abundant free content and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.
    *   This dynamic means that a large user base in India (e.g., 100 million users) should not be valued the same as in the US or other higher-ARPU markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.
*   **Concept of Time and Efficiency**:
    *   Indians are typically not paid hourly salaries, which impacts their perception of the "value of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. Most Indians cannot state their hourly or daily income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
    *   This can lead to behavior where individuals earning a high hourly rate might still spend an hour to save $10 on a flight ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
    *   Many Indian and Asian languages lack a direct word for "efficiency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **Low Trust Markets and Super Apps**:
    *   Developing nations, including India, are often "low trust markets" where consumers are wary of trying new things due to weaker institutional protections against bad company behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.
    *   This lack of trust leads to a "concentration of trust" in a few large, diversified brands or "super apps" that offer many services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. For instance, the Tata brand sells everything from salt to cars, leveraging its established trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.
    *   Therefore, established brands are exponentially more important in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. The oldest brand in the world, Chavanprash, originated in India centuries ago, and many Indian businesses still carry the founder's name to build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.
    *   In contrast to the Western advice of "focus," Asian markets, particularly low-trust ones, benefit from companies doing "many things" to maximize revenue per user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.
*   **Profit Pools and Societal Values**: A country's "profit pools" indicate what it values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. For example, India has very few retailers among its most profitable companies compared to Western markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. Patriarchal societies, like India, tend to have significant market caps in financial services over consumption sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. India's low divorce rate and lower female labor participation also mean female fashion spending is less than men's, unlike other global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

## Building Startups in India

Kunal Shah, CEO and founder of CRED (a fintech startup valued at over $6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>), provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of building in India. He previously founded three other startups, including FreeCharge, which was sold for over $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

*   **Risk Aversion**: Indian society is naturally more risk-averse, particularly in long-term oriented cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. The failure of a startup can significantly impact one's social standing, such as making it harder to find a marriage partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. This means a zero-to-one failure might not be rewarded or recognized, unlike consistent growth in a stable company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.
    *   However, this is changing, with founders gaining respect and unicorns being celebrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. India even has a "national startup day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
    *   To encourage risk-taking, society needs to grant high status to "explorers" and "risk-takers," similar to how Portuguese explorers were honored like royalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
*   **The "Profitability" Question**: Indian founders often face intense scrutiny about profitability, unlike their Western counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. This stems from a historical understanding of business as direct trading (buy low, sell high) rather than venture-capital-backed models that prioritize distribution and brand building before monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>. Kunal's own father wouldn't respect his company until it was profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.
    *   Indian tech companies make up a small fraction (2-3%) of the market cap, compared to 27-30% in the US, indicating that India is still in its early stages of building large, profitable tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   **Public Scrutiny and Envy**: Founders in India experience significant online trolling and doubt, with comments often lacking appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>. This "hyperlocal envy" means people tend to envy those close to them who have achieved success, rather than distant global figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
    *   To counteract this, founders are advised not to care about criticism from those who don't understand their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Only feedback from those who have achieved more should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.
*   **Evolution of a Founder**: Companies that excel at the 0 to 1 stage (creation) may not naturally succeed at the 10 to 100 stage (scaling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. The founder must evolve, and the organization may need to "gentrify" its talent to adapt to new stages of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Founders are essentially "uncertainty absorbers" for employees, investors, and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

## Key Traits for Success

*   **The Delta 4 Framework**: Kunal Shah developed this framework to define product success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   A product must be at least **four points better** (on a 1-10 efficiency scale) than the existing solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. For example, Uber (9) versus an old cab (3) provides a Delta of 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
    *   If the efficiency Delta is greater than or equal to four, three things happen:
        1.  It becomes **irreversible** (users won't go back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
        2.  Users have **high tolerance for failure** (minor issues won't deter them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
        3.  It becomes a **Unique Brag-worthy Proposition (UBP)**, meaning users cannot stop talking about or sharing it, leading to natural, low-cost customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   If the Delta is less than four, the product is reversible, users won't brag, and they will have zero tolerance for failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This helps explain why seemingly "tech" products (like buying a suit online) might fail if the efficiency is worse than offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Curiosity and Adaptation**:
    *   Curiosity demonstrates a lack of pride in one's expertise and an excitement for problems without clear solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>. It prevents stagnation caused by constantly trying to prove expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>.
    *   Highly successful species (like sharks, horseshoe crabs, crocodiles) that have survived for over 100 million years share three traits:
        1.  **Ability to reduce metabolism at will**: Analogous to a company's ability to "cool down" and survive during crises (e.g., COVID-19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.
        2.  **High conversion rate on every attempt (high judgment)**: They don't chase many options but have a "deadliest bite" when they pursue something, ensuring success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[onboarding_and_decisionmaking_at_startups | strong judgment]].
        3.  **Adaptability**: They adapt to changing environments, which comes from curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.
    *   Curiosity fuels "information asymmetry," a key to wealth creation, by constantly collecting and connecting dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.
*   **Second-Order Thinking**:
    *   This is the ability to correctly predict the "butterfly effect" of an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. It's considered the most powerful trait for predicting success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.
    *   It's a taxing mental exercise that the brain naturally resists unless trained from an early age, possibly through strategy games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.
    *   Asking "why" questions constantly helps develop this skill, forcing deeper historical and causal understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>.
    *   With AI (like ChatGPT), the ability to ask great questions becomes even more critical for generating valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

## Personal Journey and Lessons from Failure

Kunal Shah's own journey is rooted in overcoming personal challenges. His family experienced a severe financial crisis when he was 15, forcing him to start working early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>. He views his life as an ongoing effort to escape that initial failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.

*   **Embracing Failure**: Failure is an inevitable part of any significant endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. Entrepreneurs possess a unique ability to forget the pain of failures and extract only the lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.
*   **Learning from Others**: Life is too short to make all mistakes oneself; learning from others' failures is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[resilience_and_perseverance_in_startups | resilience and perseverance in startups]].
*   **The "Gift of Struggle"**: Kunal believes that struggle can be a significant gift that successful parents cannot easily pass on to their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>. It fosters determination and unique learning experiences, contributing to [[journey_and_challenges_of_early_employees_in_a_startup | the journey and challenges of early employees in a startup]].

## Final Thoughts on Wealth

Wealth is viewed not as a zero-sum game, but as the storage of energy, continuously expanding as humanity finds new ways to convert energy to its advantage (e.g., kinetic, fuel, solar, AI, nuclear fusion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. While wealth may always be concentrated due to the "physics of wealth," the overall database size can increase infinitely, benefiting many through collaboration and cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>.

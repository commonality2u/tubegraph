The Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) framework emphasizes that understanding customer behavior goes beyond merely identifying "pain and gain" points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Instead, it focuses on the **context** in which a customer finds themselves and the **outcome** they are trying to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. What might seem like irrational customer behavior often becomes rational when the full context is understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## People "Hire" Products for Progress

The core premise of JTBD is that people "hire" products, rather than just buying them, to make progress in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. By understanding the specific context and desired outcome, one can see the true competitive landscape from the "demand side" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### The Snickers vs. Milky Way Example
A classic illustration of this concept involves Snickers and Milky Way candy bars. While both are candy bars found in the same aisle, their "jobs" differ based on the customer's context and desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>:
*   **Snickers** is often "hired" when someone has missed a meal, has a lot of work, and is running out of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Its function is akin to a meal replacement, competing with items like protein drinks, Red Bull, or coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The role of its peanuts and nougat is to masticate into a ball, absorbing stomach acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.
*   **Milky Way** is typically "hired" after an emotional experience, often eaten alone, to regroup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Its competitors might be a glass of wine, a brownie, or even a run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Its caramel melts easily, making it feel more like a drink than food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

This example highlights that products compete not just on features, but on the underlying progress a customer is trying to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Struggling Moments as the Root of Demand

Demand for a product is not primarily created by the product itself, but by a "struggling moment" a customer experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. These moments provide the seed for true [[customer_engagement_and_product_development | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Case Study: Southern New Hampshire University
Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) discovered "anomalies" in 2010: students who paid full tuition but attended classes online, never coming to campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. By studying their context, it was revealed these students were typically older, might have had prior college attempts that didn't work out, and now had responsibilities that necessitated a different educational approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Their job was to "go back to school but couldn't" through traditional means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This insight led SNHU to build a massive online university, serving over 200,000 students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## The Four Forces of Progress

Customer behavior can be understood as a system of forces influencing whether someone will "switch" from an old solution (or no solution) to a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. These are often visualized as:
1.  **Push (F1)**: The context or struggle with the old product/situation, causing a desire for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
2.  **Pull (F2)**: The attraction of a new outcome or desired state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
3.  **Anxiety (F3)**: Worries or fears about the new product or making the switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
4.  **Habit of the Present (F4)**: The inertia or comfort of staying with the current solution, even if imperfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

For a customer to change behavior, the combined strength of the **Push (F1)** and **Pull (F2)** must be greater than the combined **Anxiety (F3)** and **Habit of the Present (F4)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This framework helps in designing products and sales processes that [[effective_customer_engagement_and_validation | enable customers to buy]], rather than just selling to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Reducing Friction
Reducing friction (Anxiety and Habit of the Present) can significantly increase sales without even modifying the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. For example, a homebuilder included moving services and two years of storage in the price of condos for downsizers, addressing the "frictional point" of disposing of old belongings. This increased sales by over 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Phases of Customer Adoption

Customers move through distinct phases when adopting a new solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>:
1.  **First Thought**: Initial awareness or idea.
2.  **Passive Looking**: Problem-aware, solution-unaware, learning phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
3.  **Active Looking**: Problem-aware, solution-aware, framing a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
4.  **Deciding**: Making trade-offs between alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
5.  **First Use**: Initial adoption of the new product.
6.  **Ongoing Use**: Building a new habit with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

Understanding a customer's current phase is crucial. For instance, a demo for a customer in the "passive looking" phase should focus on education, while a demo for someone in the "deciding" phase should highlight trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. This customer-centric approach can significantly improve conversion rates and shorten sales cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

## Interviewing for Context and Outcome

Effective [[importance_of_customer_and_user_research | customer research]] involves understanding the causal mechanisms behind behavior change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This is distinct from traditional market research that asks people what they *say* they want, as there's often a difference between stated desires and actual choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

Instead, the method draws from criminal and intelligence interrogation techniques, focusing on getting customers to tell the *story* of their decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. Key aspects include:
*   **Focus on Recent Purchases**: Interview people who recently made a purchase, asking what happened that prompted the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
*   **No Discussion Guide**: Instead of rigid questions, follow the "pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits" framework to uncover the customer's story organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.
*   **Investigative Approach**: Customers often don't consciously know *why* they bought something, only *when* they wrote the check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>. An interviewer must act as an investigator to uncover the deeper, often irrational, reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.
*   **"Bitching Ain't Switching"**: Complaining about a product doesn't mean a customer will switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. Focus on those who actually *tried* to make progress, even if they failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.
*   **Talk to Churned Customers**: Understanding why customers leave a product can reveal their ongoing struggles and contextual changes that led them to seek alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

By understanding the context and desired outcome, companies can better prioritize features and avoid adding unnecessary complexity that might deter users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. This allows for truly [[user_centered_performance_and_performative_customer_obsession | user-centered performance]].

## Key Misconceptions

A major misconception is that JTBD is solely about "pain and gain" or just about the "outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. The crucial element is the *combination* of **context and outcome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. Another frequent mistake is trying to "hypothesize" jobs in a conference room without actually talking to customers and uncovering contradictions or seemingly irrational behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. The true value is revealed when one fully grasps the context that makes seemingly irrational actions entirely rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.

This approach reveals that there are "no new jobs," but rather improved ways for technology to deliver on existing ones, as customer contexts and desired outcomes evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. [[nonlinear_dynamics_in_marketing_and_business | Innovation]] happens when companies understand what causes people to change their direction, not just the momentum of where they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

Effective product management hinges on the ability to simplify complex problems and prioritize efforts. According to Maggie Crowley, one of the most common threads across the best product managers (PMs) she has worked with, hired, and managed is their skill in breaking things down and simplifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:31">[05:31:31]</a>.

## The Essence of Simplification and Prioritization

At any given moment, the best PMs can identify the *truly* only thing that needs to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:20">[05:38:20]</a>. This skill is crucial because companies, especially large ones, can be overwhelmed by "8 million priorities, 700 OKRs, [and] 25,000 projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:43">[05:43:43]</a>. Even in startups, where finding "the one thing" might seem easier, the multitude of "fires that are happening" and the "world of opportunity" make it difficult to pick one and stick with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:54">[05:54:54]</a>.

Beyond just finding the one thing, successful PMs can **stay with that one thing long enough to actually finish it** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:13">[06:07:13]</a>. Prioritization is not merely a one-time decision; it's the ability to ensure that the chosen priority remains the most important thing and to see it through to completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:07">[06:57:07]</a>. This requires resilience and energy to consistently champion the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:29">[07:29:29]</a>.

## Building the Simplification Muscle

While some aspects of simplification might relate to inherent thinking styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:30">[11:30:30]</a>, there are tactical ways to cultivate this skill:

*   **Read Aloud**
    *   When writing, literally read your work out loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:50">[11:50:50]</a>. Often, you'll realize it's too complicated or doesn't make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.
    *   If you can explain something clearly in conversation, "Just say that" in your written communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:31">[12:31:31]</a>. The goal is to get things done, not to impress with complex prose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:44">[12:44:44]</a>.
*   **Embrace Feedback and Iteration**
    *   Gain experience by getting "as many reps in as you can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:02">[13:02:02]</a>.
    *   Have others review your work and truly listen to their feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:11">[13:11:11]</a>. Mentors or founders often possess market insights that can help simplify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:27">[13:27:27]</a>.
    *   Find peers in non-competitive spaces who can help edit and simplify your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:44">[19:44:44]</a>. Maggie Crowley utilizes a small Slack group with fellow product leaders for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:50">[19:50:50]</a>.
*   **Writing Techniques**
    *   Cut unnecessary words. Books like *On Writing Well* demonstrate how to strip down writing without losing meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:04">[14:04:04]</a>.
    *   Apply the "rule of three" (or fewer) for strategy bets, priorities, or conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:32">[14:32:32]</a>. It's a "business school ex-consultant point of view" that emphasizes conciseness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:44">[14:44:44]</a>.
    *   Generally, you can delete the first two paragraphs of almost any document you write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:08">[19:08:08]</a>. The introduction often contains unnecessary "crapola" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:27">[19:27:27]</a>.
    *   For emails and documents, use the Minto Pyramid Principle: state the headline or conclusion first, then provide supporting arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:32">[18:32:32]</a>.
*   **Focus on [[impact in product management | Impact]]**
    *   Choose the one thing that will have the most [[impact in product management | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:23">[15:23:23]</a>. Avoid lumping together many ideas, as this dilutes focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:19">[15:19:19]</a>.

## Challenges in Simplification and Prioritization

[[challenges_in_product_management | Getting to the "one thing" you should do is extremely difficult]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:39">[15:39:39]</a>. It requires the "gumption to say no" to numerous other potentially valuable activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:45">[15:45:45]</a>. A key aspect of the PM role is the willingness to "make the bet" and be responsible for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:11">[16:11:11]</a>. This "oh shit" feeling signifies the inherent risk and accountability of picking the right thing, acknowledging that it might not work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:46">[16:46:46]</a>.

Even if a company values simplification, it can be hard to achieve consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:19">[17:19:19]</a>. PMs often face the challenge of reconciling a well-defined strategy with an existing roadmap that is "bloated with all of this random stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:24:24">[47:24:24]</a>. This requires critical evaluation of ongoing work against the chosen strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:01">[48:01:01]</a>.

## Developing a Product Strategy through Simplification

Maggie Crowley outlines a detailed approach to writing a product strategy, which naturally incorporates simplification and clarity:

*   **Outline for a Product Strategy Document:**
    1.  **Mission:** Start with the company's and your team's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:05">[36:05:05]</a>.
    2.  **Landscape:** Detail the current business, product, market, competitors, SWOT analysis, and key risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:14">[36:14:14]</a>.
    3.  **Current Business Goals:** List the company's current planning goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:30:30">[36:30:30]</a>.
    4.  **Current State:** Provide an honest accounting of your product, business, and specific area, including what works, doesn't work, customer feedback, and support tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:47:47">[36:47:47]</a>.
    5.  **Technical Hurdles:** Identify big pieces of tech debt and technical investments needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:04:04">[37:04:04]</a>.
    6.  **Opportunity:** Based on the above, identify the top one or two opportunities, where you can play and win, and your unique competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:33:33">[37:33:33]</a>.
    7.  **Challenges:** Outline the hardest parts of capitalizing on the opportunity and what needs to be true for it to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:55:55">[37:55:55]</a>.
    8.  **Solution:** Propose your solution, what needs to be built, and how it might work (ideally 3 bullet points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:06:06">[38:06:06]</a>.
    9.  **Plan:** Detail how you would sequence the work and get the team to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:18:18">[38:18:18]</a>.

This comprehensive document, while potentially long (up to 20 pages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:10:10">[42:10:10]</a>, serves as the PM's "homework" to build confidence in decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:01:01">[43:01:01]</a>. It should include a summary at the top to convey the main point and suggestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:55:55">[41:55:55]</a>. Sharing it widely ensures transparency and allows for focused disagreements on specific data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:35:35">[38:35:35]</a>. Through this process, PMs often realize when an idea is flawed and cut unnecessary elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:00:00">[47:00:00]</a>. This systematic approach contributes to [[becoming_more_strategic_in_product_management | becoming more strategic in product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:10">[35:10:10]</a>.

## One-Pagers and PRDs

Similar principles apply to one-pagers or Product Requirement Documents (PRDs). This document is the PM's primary artifact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:24:24">[50:24:24]</a>. The most important section is the beginning, which addresses:
*   What is the background and context? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:57:57">[50:57:57]</a>
*   What is the problem? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:57:57">[50:57:57]</a>
*   Why does it matter? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:02:02">[51:02:02]</a>
*   **Why does it matter *now*?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:02:02">[51:02:02]</a> (This critical question helps prioritize against other opportunities, especially perishable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:00:00">[53:00:00]</a>.)

A good one-pager helps center the team around the problem and why it's worth solving *now* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:07:07">[51:07:07]</a>. It should also serve as a home base for decisions made along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:30">[51:30:30]</a>. To ensure effectiveness, Maggie recommends sharing the document early with your engineering counterpart and asking them to "shred this, go through it, rip it apart, vomit comments on it, tear this down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:32:32">[52:32:32]</a>. As a PM, you "can't be precious about your work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:43:43">[52:43:43]</a>.

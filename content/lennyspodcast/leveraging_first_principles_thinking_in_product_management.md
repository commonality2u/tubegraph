Ramp, a rapidly growing SaaS business, employs an approach to product development that prioritizes moving quickly, empowering individual team members, and [[First principles thinking in leadership | thinking from first principles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This method has been instrumental in their success, despite "first principles thinking" being a common, sometimes clich√©d, term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.

## What is First Principles Thinking at Ramp?
At Ramp, [[First principles thinking in leadership | thinking from first principles]] means not pattern matching from past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. Instead, it involves delving into the fundamentals of what the company is trying to achieve and thinking through them very deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. This approach is particularly crucial for Ramp because it is a unique business that combines elements of a credit card company (risk management, underwriting), a payments company (money movement), and a software company (spend management, accounting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. They build for both small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) with a product-led growth (PLG) model and for enterprise clients through sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>. When dealing with something that hasn't been done before, first principles thinking becomes essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>.

## Operationalizing First Principles Thinking
To effectively utilize [[First principles thinking in leadership | first principles thinking]], Ramp focuses on several key aspects:

*   **Hiring Philosophy**
    Ramp seeks to hire individuals who can naturally [[First principles thinking in leadership | think from first principles]] and are willing to set aside their prior experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This can be challenging for those who come in as "subject matter experts" and find the complexity of Ramp's business requires a fresh perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. Influencing teams by simply stating "my past company did XYZ" is considered an anti-pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.
*   **Leadership Adaptation**
    Jeff Charles, VP of Product at Ramp, recounts his own experience, where he initially intended to apply best practices from previous roles but realized he needed to fundamentally rethink how product should be developed because Ramp's engineering team was exceptional ("A-plus") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. This emphasizes that even established leaders must adapt their processes based on fundamental principles of the new environment, rather than blindly copying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solving Through Writing**
    When faced with complex, scalable problems that few companies have successfully tackled, Jeff's approach involves:
    1.  Shutting down the laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.
    2.  Taking out a piece of paper and writing the question as simply as possible at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
    3.  Spending time thinking about how to answer it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.
    This process of writing helps to clearly think through problems and effectively communicate solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. It's about actively doing the thinking rather than just reading or Googling for answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>.

## Example: The Support Team
A clear example of [[First principles thinking in leadership | first principles thinking]] at Ramp is the structure and philosophy of their support team, which reports directly to the Head of Product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

The first principle behind this decision is that "every support ticket is a failure of our product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. If the product worked perfectly, customers would not need to contact support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>. This organizational structure directly holds the product team accountable for support issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>.

The second principle is the belief that a significant amount of value to customers comes from deeply understanding them, listening to their feedback, and acting on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. Instead of hiring agents focused solely on resolving tickets, Ramp incentivizes its support team to decrease the number of tickets over time and increase deflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. This required hiring a different type of individual who could later become leaders in other parts of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>.

By starting from these first principles rather than pattern matching or using industry benchmarks for support teams, Ramp has achieved an extremely low contact rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>. With over 400,000 users, their team of agents is under 30 people, a remarkably efficient ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.

## Impact on Product Management
[[First principles thinking in leadership | First principles thinking]] encourages a culture of accountability and continuous improvement. It ensures that solutions are rooted in a deep understanding of the problem and the unique context of the business, rather than simply replicating what has worked elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

Growth is a relatively new field, often leading to a proliferation of "growth hacks" and advice that may be out of context or specific to a single example, rather than universally applicable patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Elena Verna, a B2B growth expert, shares ten [[ineffective_growth_tactics | growth strategies and tactics that never work]] but which companies frequently invest significant resources into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>.

## [[Common pitfalls in strategic planning | Growth Tactics That Never Work]]

### 1. Hiring a Growth Team Too Soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>
There's a widespread [[common_misconceptions_about_research_within_organizations | misconception]] that a growth team is necessary to kickstart growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. In reality, founders and the founding team should initially figure out how to grow the company to its first $1 million to $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Many companies don't establish growth teams until they reach $100 million or even $200 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

The core reasons a growth team is not needed too early are:
*   **Product-Market Fit (PMF):** PMF and product distribution cannot be outsourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. A product must have a solution to a problem, with customers not only using it but also retaining and staying with it, indicating good retention or a high "Chana score" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **Data Volume:** Growth teams require sufficient user data to run experiments, analyze hypotheses, and optimize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. With only 10 users, there isn't enough data for a growth team to function effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

Founder-led growth is crucial in the early stages as it trains the entire company to be responsible for growth, rather than isolating it to one team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. For sales-led companies, sales teams should be hired before growth teams, as sales handle monetization, activation, and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Growth roles are more critical for product-led motions, especially when aiming for self-serve revenue through freemium or trial acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

### 2. Hiring a Head of Growth to Reverse Business Decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>
Bringing in a head of growth or forming a growth team when a business is already slowing down or declining is often ineffective and destined to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. A growth team can optimize growth and potentially lift metrics by 10-15%, but it cannot fix fundamental issues like a disappearing product-market fit, an outdated product, or core marketing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

Growth teams amplify existing product-market fit and accelerate growth in an already growing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. If a business is declining, the focus should first be on addressing the root causes of the slowdown, ideally plateauing the decline or showing immediate signs of recovery through core product and marketing efforts, before a growth team is brought in to scale those gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Otherwise, it becomes a significant waste of resources with minimal return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### 3. Rebranding or Redesigning for Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>
Rebranding or redesigning a marketing site (especially the homepage) rarely, if ever, produces positive performance results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. While redesigns might be necessary for entering new markets or reflecting product evolution, they often represent a step backward in performance that requires substantial optimization efforts to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

New CMOs often redesign based on personal taste, promising increased acquisition that rarely materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Such initiatives are expensive, time-consuming (8-10 months minimum), and typically yield lackluster results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. If undertaken, companies should anticipate a performance hit at launch and allocate an additional 3-6 months for optimization to reach previous levels or potential upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Redesigns are often a shot in the dark, and prettier does not equate to better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### 4. Blindly Copying the Competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>
While understanding competitor actions is vital for inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, directly copying their tactics or flows is a common pitfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Every product experience is unique to its customers and channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Furthermore, you may not know the actual experience users receive or the context of its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

Skipping essential steps like ideation, user research, customer interviews, and A/B testing by assuming "it works for them, it must work for us" leads to subpar results 95% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Copying competition leads to mediocrity; true leadership comes from innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Similarly, relying on generalized benchmarks from competitors can be misleading due to differing metric definitions (e.g., how "sign-ups" or "prospecting visitors" are counted) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Benchmarks are inputs, not definitive goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### 5. Believing Your Problems Are Unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>
A significant [[common_pitfalls_in_strategic_planning | pitfall]] is assuming your company's growth problems are unique and require re-engineering solutions from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. In reality, most growth problems have been encountered and solved (or failed at) by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Starting from scratch wastes valuable time and incurs huge opportunity costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

Instead, leverage existing knowledge by:
*   Studying how competitors tackle similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   Networking and talking to people who have solved analogous issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   Focusing on "patternization" and creating frameworks to solve recurring problems efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This allows you to quickly reach 60% of a solution and then add authentic, unique implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

Overcoming the ego of admitting you don't know everything is crucial for seeking help and accelerating learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### 6. Over-prioritizing Paid & Organic Channels (SEO, SEM, Social) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>
While SEO, SEM, and social media (paid ads) are valuable, growth teams often make a mistake by prioritizing them too heavily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. These are "rented" channels; you pay Google or social platforms for distribution, and their algorithms can change at any time, reducing your control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

The top priority for a growth team should be creating "owned" or "earned" channels where you have exclusive control and no one can compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Product-Led Growth Acquisition:** Relying on virality, word-of-mouth, or user-generated content (UGC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   **Community Building:** Fostering a community around your product that competitors cannot buy into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Referral Mechanisms:** Such as Dropbox's sharing model, which drives 50% of its acquisition, making it a stable, earned channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Investing in these earned channels, while potentially costly in product and engineering resources, creates a sustainable "gift that keeps on giving" that no one can take away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. Neglecting them leaves your growth future dependent on external algorithms and leads to increased customer acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

### 7. Failing to Evolve Growth Models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>
Companies often start with a single growth model (e.g., product-led or sales-led) that works for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. However, not continuously overlaying and evolving different [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth models]] (product-led, marketing-led, sales-led) is a significant [[common_pitfalls_in_strategic_planning | mistake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

Just as products need continuous evolution and PMF expansion, growth models have limited lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:22]</a>. Over-optimizing the same growth model leads to diminishing returns, a concept described as "the law of shitty click-throughs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. While some loops, like Dropbox's sharing, can last for many years, most growth loops yield meaningful results for only about five to seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

Companies should proactively think about new ways to attract users and continuously introduce new growth loops and channels. Allocating 20-25% of a growth team's annual time to new initiatives is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. These new loops may take 6 months to 1.5 years to produce visible revenue, so layering them in early is crucial to avoid a growth slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

Examples of new growth loops to explore:
*   **User-Generated Content (UGC):** Harnessing UGC (templates, case studies, reviews) for activation and acquisition, especially as AI changes search interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
*   **Referral Mechanisms:** For B2C, referrals are key; for B2B, inviting team members to complete tasks or share reports can drive internal virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

### 8. Not Hiring Advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>
Failing to hire advisors is a significant [[common_mistakes_in_earlystage_startups | mistake]] for growth teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. Advisors, for a reasonable fee, can provide a network of data points and patterns from their vast experience, propelling a company forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. They act as additional input into decision-making, offering insights that internal teams might lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

Given the information asymmetry in the growth field, where much knowledge is proprietary, advisors who have "lived through" similar challenges can be invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. To vet advisors effectively, conduct a paid workshop on a specific problem to see them in action and assess their ability to provide clear, actionable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. Continuously evaluate their value monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

### 9. Excessive Risk Aversion (Testing Everything) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>
When every growth initiative becomes an experiment, it indicates a problem of excessive risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. This "paralyzing disease" slows down progress, velocity, and learning within growth teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

While experimentation is fundamental to growth, not everything needs a precise scientific measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. Recommendations:
*   **Trust Intuition:** Rely more on intuition, especially when data volume is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
*   **Sample Size Rule:** If you cannot collect a sufficient sample size within a month, don't test it; use pre-versus-post analysis instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic vs. Iterative:** Reserve rigorous A/B testing for high-stakes strategic pivots or high-traffic areas where even small percentage differences mean significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
*   **Iterate and Measure:** For other initiatives, release, conduct 24-hour, 7-day, and 28-day readouts, and measure long-term retention or expansion data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

Failure is inevitable in growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. The goal is to shorten the failure cycle, not eliminate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Over-reliance on statistics can be misleading, as they are directional data points, not guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

### 10. "Fire Round" of Minor Misconceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>
*   **Color Optimizations:** Testing shades of colors for buttons or UI elements is an outdated tactic that rarely drives significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:03]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Sign-ups:** Adding numerous third-party sign-up options (Google, Facebook, Slack OAuth) generally doesn't increase acquisition; it mostly shifts user preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. While important for developer products (e.g., GitHub OAuth), for productivity tools, email sign-up is often sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.
*   **One-Email Wonders:** Stressing over the impact of a single email is pointless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. With low open and click rates, a single email will never cause a significant lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. Email should be viewed as part of a series, a comprehensive communication strategy interacting with product communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.
*   **Obsession with Removing Friction / Simplifying Onboarding:** While critical friction (e.g., confusing steps) should be addressed, blindly removing steps or oversimplifying to an "oblivion" can strip a product of its identity and value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. "Simplify onboarding" should never be a problem statement on a roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. Simplifying is a *solution* to problems like confusion or lack of education, not a problem itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:10]</a>.

## Recommended [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | Growth Frameworks]]

Elena Verna recommends several powerful [[effective_growth_frameworks | growth frameworks]] as starting points for ideation and understanding patterns:

*   **Growth Loops:** This framework emphasizes thinking about growth as self-contained flywheels where an action generates a reaction that fuels another action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. It's crucial for creating sustainable growth engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. Resources from Reforge (Brian Balfour, Casey Winters, Andrew Chen) are highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>.
*   **Racecar Framework:** This framework helps organize growth initiatives into distinct parts:
    *   **Engines (Loops):** Continuous spinning growth loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Fuel:** Inputs like paid marketing dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Turbo Boosts:** Large, impactful events like user conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Lubrications (Optimizations):** Refinements to ensure efficient performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.
*   **Adjacent User Theory (from Ravi Mehta):** This framework is powerful for considering growth evolution by identifying and optimizing experiences for "adjacent users" who fall outside the core ideal customer profile (ICP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. This can bring additional value to a product without necessarily expanding the core PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.

These frameworks serve as "mental models" or a "system of beliefs" for approaching growth strategically, not just tactically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>.

Effective user research is crucial for product development, yet the field is undergoing a "reckoning," necessitating significant changes in how research is conducted and integrated into companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:16">[01:27:16]</a>. The ultimate goal is to ensure user insights drive tangible business value and product improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>.

## The State of User Research: A Reckoning

The user research discipline, particularly over the last 15 years, is seen as "dying" in its traditional form, prompting a need for rapid adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. This shift is highlighted by recent layoffs in UX and user research teams, suggesting the system is "broken" and research is not consistently delivering the expected value or impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. A core issue is that too much "wrong type of research" is being done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

### Jud Anon's Background

Jud Anon has played a significant role in establishing user research practices at major companies like Facebook and Airbnb, with many of his direct reports leading research teams at prominent tech companies such as Figma, Notion, Slack, Robinhood, Duolingo, and Fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>. He now consults on organizational challenges, [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | product strategy]], design, research, hiring, onboarding, and crisis management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.

### User-Centered Performance

A phenomenon Jud Anon describes as "user-centered performance" refers to customer obsession or user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than genuinely focused on learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:12">[02:04:12]</a>. This is common when actions are taken to signal commitment to user-centricity without genuinely desiring a different decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:01">[02:09:01]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Product Managers (PMs) asking researchers to "just run a quick user study to validate assumptions" at the end of a product process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:53">[02:04:53]</a>. At this stage, it's often too late for the research to matter, serving only to "check the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:03">[02:05:03]</a>.
*   Executives or product leaders doing "executive listening sessions" or focus groups primarily for show, rather than genuine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:25">[02:05:25]</a>. This is often "97% performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:39">[02:05:39]</a>.

This phenomenon is also linked to cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:52">[02:05:52]</a>. A key mantra for effective research is "we don't validate, we falsify" â€“ seeking to be proven wrong to uncover new insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Many PMs and designers, however, are in a mindset of seeking validation, which contributes to user-centered performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:22">[02:06:22]</a>.

## Categories of User Research

Jud Anon proposes a framework for understanding user research types:
*   **Macro Research**: Big-picture, strategic, business-focused, forward-looking research aimed at innovation, market understanding, competitor analysis, and long-term product direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. This includes involvement in strategic planning, Tam studies, and concept car projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   **Micro Research**: Highly focused, technical usability research aimed at perfecting product details and understanding AB test results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>. This type of research can drive significant and rapid business value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:16">[01:35:16]</a>.
*   **Middle-Range Research**: This is the "blob place" where research questions are of "middle altitude" and focus on general user understanding (e.g., how users think, feel, behave, use a product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.

The problem, according to Anon, is that too much time is spent on middle-range research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. While often interesting to researchers and teams, it is "not impactful enough for the business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. It yields insights that are hard to operationalize, triggers post-hoc bias ("that was kind of obvious, we knew that already"), and fulfills a need for performative user-centeredness without driving actual change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Effective User Research

To overcome these challenges and ensure research drives business growth, several strategies are essential:

### 1. Integrate Research Early and Consistently

The most crucial solution is to restructure how products are made, integrating research much more fully into the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:32">[01:34:32]</a>.
*   **Consistent Relationships**: Researchers should have consistent relationships with product managers and designers, being part of the process from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **Partnership, Not Service**: Research should not be a "service function" that is called in reactively at the end of a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. When researchers are in the room listening and participating, they can significantly impact framing the right questions that drive maximum business and product improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Unified Objectives**: Research teams should share the same metrics for success (OKRs) as PMs, engineers, and designers, working together towards common goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. A strong indicator of influence is when decision-making meetings cannot happen without the researcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### 2. Cultivate Diverse Research Skills

Great researchers possess a "Swiss army knife" of skills, moving beyond a purely qualitative approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The five essential tools include:
1.  **Formative or Generative User Experience Research**: Forward-looking, innovation-focused, open-ended, and ethnographic methods to understand new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
2.  **Evaluative Research (Usability Testing)**: Micro-level research focused on evaluating products and ensuring high-quality, pixel-perfect execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. This can quickly yield significant business value, as seen in the "multi-million dollar button" example at Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:16">[01:35:16]</a>.
3.  **Basic, Rigorous Survey Design**: The best scaled way to get responses from communities, enabling well-crafted surveys to gather rich data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
4.  **Applied Statistics**: Essential for interacting with AB testing environments and understanding data rigorously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
5.  **Technical Skills (SQL/Prompt Engineering)**: The ability to run queries, understand data in data-rich environments, and interact with generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

### 3. Adopt a Business-Oriented Mindset

Researchers must be explicitly "profit focused" and understand the business context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Understand Business Goals**: Read quarterly reports, listen to shareholder calls, understand organizational OKRs, and deeply know business metrics and the conversion funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Alignment**: Propose research questions that address specific points in the funnel or competitive threats, framing insights in the language of business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Empathy and Profit Overlap**: While empathy for the user is crucial, researchers need to actively find the overlap between user needs and business profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### 4. Overcome Common Tropes and Biases

Product teams and designers often hold misconceptions about research:
*   **"Research is too slow"**: Good research, particularly micro-level studies, can be conducted rapidly (e.g., in 48 hours), speeding up development by preventing costly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **"I can do my own research"**: While engaging with customers is vital, professional researchers know how to avoid biases and turn anecdotal feedback into actionable insights, ensuring quality data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **"AB test everything"**: AB tests show *what* happened but rarely *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Researchers provide the "how and why," which is critical for future product improvement and developing a better product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
*   **"If I'd asked my users, they would have said faster horses"**: This apocryphal Henry Ford quote is misleading; good research does not involve simply asking users what they want, but rather understanding their underlying needs and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **"We knew this already"**: This "post-hoc bias" or "narrative fallacy" occurs when people selectively remember and construct narratives to feel they already knew an outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Researchers expose blind spots and constantly improve intuition through evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

PMs should also be wary of relying solely on their "gut intuition" or "dogfooding" the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. While important, personal experience does not reflect diverse user contexts, priorities, or constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Engaging in "system two" (slow, analytical) thinking and incorporating the "wisdom of the crowd" by bringing in diverse perspectives can mitigate biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Business Impact: The "Why" of User Research

[[impact_of_design_on_business_growth | Design and user research]] should not just tell what product to build, but rather help develop a strong mental model of the domain and user, serving as a framework based on actual evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This enables teams to jointly experiment their way to a successful product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

### The Problem with NPS

Jud Anon believes Net Promoter Score (NPS) is fundamentally flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>.
*   **Methodological Issues**: NPS uses a 0-10 scale that is often unlabeled, and its 11-item structure leads to decreased precision, especially on mobile, where options may be "below the fold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.
*   **Fundamental Flaw**: The "likelihood to recommend" question itself is inherently problematic as people rarely recommend operating systems or similar products in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **Inconsistency**: NPS is idiosyncratic and inconsistent in how it's asked, making apples-to-apples comparisons across industries or even within a company unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>.

**Recommendation**: A simple Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) metric (e.g., "Overall, how satisfied are you with your experience?") is a better alternative. It has superior data properties, is more precise, and is more strongly correlated with business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.

## Moving Forward: Recommendations for the Field

### For Companies
*   **Unify Insights Functions**: Break down silos between different insights disciplines (UX research, consumer insights, market research, data science, customer service feedback) to create a single, integrated "insights machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Lean, Integrated Processes**: Integrate researchers into a unified, lean process where they are "arm-in-arm" partners from the beginning, rather than a late-stage service function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

### For Researchers
*   **Develop Diverse Skills**: Master the "five tools" of research (formative, evaluative, survey design, applied statistics, technical skills) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **Deep Business Knowledge**: Understand the language of product and business, including metrics and company strategy, to ensure insights are like a "scalpel" for precise intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Build Strong Relationships**: Actively foster strong, trusting relationships with product managers, designers, and engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Ruthless Prioritization**: Work with partners to say "no" and focus on the most important projects, ensuring quality over quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Excellent Communication**: Effectively communicate research findings, tailoring presentations to the audience (e.g., PM vs. executive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Optimal Researcher Ratios and Influence

Instead of fixed ratios, the organizing principle for staffing researchers should be relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Companies have enough researchers when those who need a constant research partner have one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. The goal is to create "pain of loss" for those who don't have a dedicated researcher, demonstrating the value through impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

Even in early-stage startups, a researcher can drive incredible value by making processes faster, not slower, and providing answers that are otherwise impossible to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This is especially true for major iterations or pivots, where an insights person with a "Swiss army knife" of tools can provide evidence to inform tough decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

Overall, the future of user research is bright, but it requires both researchers to proactively develop diverse skills and companies to build more inclusive and integrated models for research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

While "[[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_business | storytelling]]" is a popular buzzword in business, many professionals are hesitant to truly embrace it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This reluctance stems from a fear of separating themselves from the "herd," which they perceive as a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, the alternative is being forgettable, as human minds are not designed to retain facts, statistics, or platitudes not attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The risk of not telling stories is being 100% forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Matthew Dicks, author of "Storyworthy," a highly recommended book on [[storytelling_as_a_critical_skill_for_product_managers | storytelling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, emphasizes that effective storytelling is a learnable skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Dicks, a 59-time Moth StorySlam winner and nine-time GrandSlam champion, also teaches [[improving_public_speaking_skills | public speaking]] and [[storytelling_and_drawing_in_product_management | storytelling]] to companies like Slack, Amazon, Lego, and Salesforce through his company, Speak Up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Core Principles of Storytelling

### The 5-Second Moment of Transformation
Every compelling story revolves around a singular "5-second moment" of either transformation or realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Transformation** involves evolving from one kind of person to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Realization** means shifting from an old way of thinking to a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
These changes, while seemingly gradual, culminate in a precise moment where the "flip" occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The story's purpose is to provide context for this moment, allowing the audience to experience it with the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

> "Essentially every story is about a singular moment. I call it five seconds, it can be one second honestly. It's a moment of either transformation... meaning sort of I'm telling you a story about how I once used to be one kind of person and now I'm a new kind of person or more common is realization which is I used to think something and then some stuff happened and now I think a new thing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>

**Example: Eileen's Confidence**
Dicks recounts a student, Eileen, who struggled with anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. After working to build her confidence, a pivotal moment occurred when he asked if she was ready to be called to the board for math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Her cheeky reply, "First of all, I don't like that cheeky smile of yours," was the 5-second realization that she trusted him and felt confident enough to be herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This brief interaction could be expanded into a longer story detailing their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Starting at the End
For true stories about oneself, companies, or products, storytellers should know the ending first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This endpoint informs the entire narrative, as the beginning and end of a story operate in opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. For instance, in a romantic comedy, knowing the characters will fall in love by the end dictates that they must start by disliking each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

> "The easiest one is a romantic comedy, two people are not in love at the beginning of the movie, you know they're going to be in love at the end of the movie." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>

### The Importance of Change
A moment of transformation or realization gives the story importance and allows the audience to connect universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. While simply reporting on daily events might only resonate with those in similar situations, stories about change tap into shared human experiences like finding confidence or shifting beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Checklist for a Good Story

A good story generally adheres to three criteria:
1.  **There is a change that happens** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
2.  **The Dinner Test**: The story should be similar to one you'd tell at a dinner party, slightly elevated but natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Avoid artificial language like unattributed dialogue or sound effects at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
3.  **It has to be your story**: [[telling_personal_and_transformative_stories | Stories must be about you]] in some way to allow for vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Sharing personal insights and emotions creates a deeper connection with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. While you can include experiences of others, frame them through how they impacted *your* life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

**Avoiding Vacation Stories**
Most vacation stories are simply recounting events and don't engage an audience unless there's a 5-second moment of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. If such a moment occurs, focus only on that specific incident; the vacation setting itself is often irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. The shortest version of every story is usually the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

## Enhancing Public Speaking and Business Storytelling

### Benefits of Storytelling in Business
Without [[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_business | storytelling]], business communication risks being "round, white, and flavorless," making you forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. While people want to be perceived as storytellers, they often fear standing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. However, memorable presentations, like the one about the childhood lunchbox, create lasting impressions, unlike fluent but forgettable executive talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. This highlights [[storytelling_as_a_critical_skill_for_product_managers | storytelling as a critical skill for product managers]] and other business professionals.

### Non-Annoying Storytelling in the Workplace
Storytelling in business doesn't always mean a formal public address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
*   **Boris and the Little League Story**: Boris, a factory owner, shared a personal story with his sales team about his son striking out in a championship game but quickly moving past the failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. He used this to illustrate how salespeople should quickly recover from lost accounts instead of sulking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>. This personal anecdote was far more effective than a direct reprimand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.
*   **Masha and the Slack Narrative**: Masha, former Director of Corporate Communications at Slack, crafted a narrative to compete with Microsoft Teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. She later incorporated a 30-second anecdote about how the idea came to her on a lonely Tuesday night during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. This small personal detail created immense connection with her audience, transforming her from a "corporate monolith" into a relatable human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.

### Making it Personal
Weaving personal details into your communication can make you more relatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>. Creating a "personal interest inventory" helps identify aspects of your life that might resonate with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. For example, mentioning you're married can signal reliability, while being a marathon runner creates intense connection with fellow runners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. The goal is to be "full of color and full of edge and full of flavor," rather than bland and forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

### Four Ways to Keep People Listening
To truly engage an audience, especially in a business context where they might not initially want to listen, focus on these four elements:
1.  **Stakes**: What should your audience be worried about or wondering? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>
    *   **Elephant**: Something big and immediate to grab attention (e.g., "a big spaceship shooting at a small spaceship") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. It doesn't have to be the main point but sets a tone of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.
    *   **Backpack**: Tell the audience your plan or hopes so they can feel invested in the outcome (e.g., in Oceans 11, knowing the heist plan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.
    *   **Breadcrumbs**: Offer small hints or details that build anticipation without revealing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
    *   **Hourglass**: When you reach a pivotal moment, slow down the narrative and add details to prolong suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
    *   **Crystal Balls**: Predict a (potentially false but realistic) terrible future to heighten audience concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
2.  **Surprise**: Deliver moments the audience didn't see coming, yet feel inevitable in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. This requires clever planting of information earlier in the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.
3.  **Suspense**: Keep the audience wondering what will happen next, often leading to a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.
4.  **Humor**: Daring to be funny sets you apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. While risky, humor makes a presentation memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.
    *   **Nostalgia**: Leverage shared past experiences (e.g., old technology, historical job searching methods) as they are inherently funny and relatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. This also allows you to demonstrate expertise by showing understanding of market evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
    *   **One of These Things is Not Like the Other**: Present three items where two are expected, and the third is unexpected, creating a humorous contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

### Non-Obvious Applications: Speaking with Adjacency
Storytelling isn't limited to formal presentations. For instance, a biotech scientist selling specialized tubes didn't present data at a conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. Instead, he told a story about the "nightmare" of buying different types of apples for his family's specific preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. He then connected this to his company's ethos: providing precisely sized tubes for specific needs, unlike competitors who offered only one option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.

This is an example of "speaking with adjacency," where you match themes, meanings, or messages, not content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>. The "snap" of realization when the audience connects the apple story to the tubes creates a powerful and memorable impression, building long-term positive associations with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

### Band-Aid vs. Bricks Approach
There are two ways to approach [[storytelling_as_a_critical_skill_for_product_managers | storytelling in business]]:
1.  **Band-Aid Approach**: Finding a story to solve an immediate problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. While this can provide a quick fix, it doesn't build a sustainable storytelling skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>.
2.  **Bricks Approach**: Proactively building a "vault of stories" that can be deployed as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:51">[01:41:51]</a>. This is the recommended long-term strategy for developing a true storytelling mindset.

## Homework for Life Framework
The "Homework for Life" framework is a daily practice to cultivate a storytelling mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

### Purpose and Process
Every day, before bed, record one moment from the day that would be worth telling as a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. Dicks uses an Excel spreadsheet with two columns: date and the story moment, written in a single cell stretching across the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>. The goal is not just to find a story, but to develop a "lens for storytelling," seeing moments that were previously overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.

> "I just decided every day before I go to bed I'm going to look back on the day and find one moment that would have been worth telling as a story even if it wasn't really worth telling I was going to write it down." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>

### Benefits Beyond Story Collection
*   **Slowing Down Time**: Actively accounting for each day prevents time from feeling like it "flies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>. By recalling daily moments, you effectively stretch out time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.
*   **Seeing Patterns**: This practice helps identify recurring patterns or subtle dynamics in your life that might otherwise go unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. For example, Dicks realized he "fights" with his wife through chores after noticing a pattern of grumbling while performing tasks she requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
*   **Therapeutic Element**: It provides a positive, self-centered reflection, fostering self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>.
*   **Recovering Past Memories**: Actively seeking out moments in the present often triggers forgotten memories from the past, enriching your personal narrative bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

### Practical Steps
1.  **Start Today**: Begin immediately. Even if the best you have is a "click out" (a small, mundane detail), record it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>.
2.  **Use a Spreadsheet**: Google Sheets or Excel is effective for tracking these moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.
3.  **Track Throughout the Day**: Instead of waiting until night, try to jot down moments at intervals (e.g., lunchtime, after work, evening) to capture fresh details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>.
4.  **Be Open to Memories**: Label recovered memories with a capital "Memory" to differentiate them from daily entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>.
5.  **Practice Telling Stories**: Find listeners willing to provide space for your stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. Your first attempts may not be perfect, but consistent practice improves "decision-making" in storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>.

## Overcoming Public Speaking Nerves
Most nervousness associated with public speaking occurs *before* you begin talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Once you start speaking, the anxiety often dissipates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>. Acknowledging this can be a relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>. Remember that most people experience nervousness; you're not alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.

To [[improving_public_speaking_skills | improve public speaking skills]] and reduce nerves:
*   **Record and Listen Passively**: Record your talk and listen to it repeatedly while doing other tasks (e.g., grocery shopping, laundry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. This helps the content "seep into your soul" without the pressure of active practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
*   **Active Listening for Transitions**: While listening, actively check if you remember the transitions between sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>. Most people forget transitions, not the main content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Prepare "monics" or memory aids for these transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:38">[01:23:38]</a>.
*   **Avoid Memorization**: Memorizing a talk can lead to more suffering if you forget a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>. Instead, aim to remember the talk without rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>.

## The Power of "Yes"
Saying "yes" to opportunities, even those that seem crazy or undesirable, is crucial for personal growth and [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | leadership development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>. Declining opportunities out of presumption (believing you already know what's on the other side of the door) is foolish and arrogant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a>.

> "When someone asks me to do something that scares me, that is when I run to that thing as quickly as possible with all of my might as terrified as I am, because I know that it's the things that frighten me are often the things that are the best for me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>

A "yes" can always turn into a "no" later if an experience isn't right for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>. The things that scare you often hold the most potential for growth and lead to extraordinary opportunities and causal chains of events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>.

## Tactical Tip for Starting a Story
To immediately grab an audience's attention, start every story with:
1.  **Location**: Where are you? This activates imagination and allows the audience to visualize the setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>.
2.  **Action**: Something needs to be happening right away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>. This signals that the story is moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:08">[01:39:08]</a>.

This simple technique signals to the audience that a story is beginning, encouraging them to quiet down and listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:13">[01:40:13]</a>.

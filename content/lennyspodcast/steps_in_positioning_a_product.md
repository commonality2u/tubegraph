[[Product Positioning Strategy | Product positioning]] is a foundational marketing concept that defines how a product is the best in the world at delivering specific value to a well-defined set of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. When a product isn't performing well, the problem may lie in its [[Product positioning and its importance | positioning]] rather than the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.

Effective [[Product Positioning Strategy | product positioning]] is a "team sport" requiring [[Importance of Alignment in Positioning | alignment]] across various departments, including marketing, product, sales, and customer success, ideally with the CEO involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This collaborative effort ensures everyone is "singing the same song" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Misalignment within a company is often the primary reason for weak [[Product Positioning Strategy | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

## How to Approach Positioning

The process for [[Product Positioning Strategy | positioning]] a product should avoid relying solely on internal opinions about what makes the product appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. Instead, it should be based on a structured methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, such as the one outlined by April Dunford, author of *Obviously Awesome* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.

### 1. Competitive Alternatives
The first step is to understand what you need to "beat" to win a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. This includes:
*   **Status Quo:** What customers are currently doing to solve their problem, even if it's suboptimal (e.g., spreadsheets, manual processes). This is crucial because 40% of B2B deals are lost to "no decision" â€“ meaning they stick with the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
*   **Shortlist Competitors:** Other products or services that a customer might consider when actively looking for a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

Understanding these alternatives provides a clear "stake in the ground" for what the product must overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

### 2. Differentiated Capabilities
Once the competitive landscape is clear, identify specific features, functions, or company capabilities (e.g., pricing, professional services) that your product possesses which the alternatives do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

### 3. Value
Translate these unique capabilities into the value they deliver to the customer. For each differentiated feature, ask: "So what? Why does a customer care about it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. This process often reveals two or three core value themes or buckets that are truly differentiated, unlike generic benefits any alternative could offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

### 4. Best-Fit Customers (Target Customers)
Not all customers care about the differentiated value in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. This step involves defining the characteristics of a target account that would highly value your unique offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. This defines the "best-fit customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

### 5. Market Category
The final step is to define the market category in which the product is positioned. This is the context that makes the product's unique value obvious to the target customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. Starting with the market category without first understanding differentiation and target customers can lead to poor [[Product Positioning Strategy | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

## Output of the Positioning Process

The output of this process is typically:
1.  **A Documented Positioning Statement:** This captures the competitive alternatives, differentiated capabilities, unique value, target customers, and chosen market category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.
2.  **A Sales Narrative/Pitch:** This transforms the core positioning into a compelling story that sales teams can use to engage qualified prospects. This often includes a deck, a demo, and a script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. This narrative should arm the "champion" within a prospect's company (the person driving the purchase) to sell the solution internally to other stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.

## When to Focus on Positioning

In the very early stages of a product (e.g., pre-launch or with a handful of customers), it's advisable to maintain a "positioning thesis" rather than rigid [[Product Positioning Strategy | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. This thesis is based on assumptions and initial research, which are likely to be partially incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. Keeping the [[Product Positioning Strategy | positioning]] "loose" allows the market to pull the product in unexpected but potentially more successful directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.

A company should start taking [[Product Positioning Strategy | positioning]] seriously and tighten it up when a clear pattern emerges regarding which customers love the product and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. This could be defined by customer size, software usage, team structure, or other firmographic or behavioral characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.

## Positioning vs. Messaging vs. Branding

*   **[[Product Positioning Strategy | Positioning]]**: Defines how a product wins in the market by identifying its unique value against alternatives for a specific target audience. It's a fundamental input for other marketing activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
*   **Messaging**: The specific text and language used on a website, in marketing materials, or during sales pitches. It flows directly from the defined [[Product Positioning Strategy | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   **Branding**: Encompasses what the brand stands for and its overall identity. Like messaging, it requires a clear [[Product Positioning Strategy | positioning]] first to ensure distinctiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

## The Role of Product Managers in Positioning

[[Role of Product Managers | Product Managers]] should be involved in the [[Product Positioning Strategy | positioning]] exercise because their understanding of the product is crucial, and weak [[Product Positioning Strategy | positioning]] can manifest as misalignment within the product team itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. [[Effective product management strategies | Effective product management strategies]] require understanding the value the product delivers and for whom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

## Example: Help Scout

Help Scout is a company selling customer success software in a crowded market. Their [[Product Positioning Strategy | positioning]] approach exemplifies the steps:
*   **Competitive Alternatives:** Zendesk (a large competitor), but also basic email or shared inboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
*   **Differentiated Capabilities:** Features focused on delivering "amazing service," such as a proper service-oriented shared inbox, no ticket numbers (assigned a person), and chat bots that only appear when a real person is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Value:** Deepening customer relationships and driving growth through customer loyalty, rather than simply reducing call center costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
*   **Best-Fit Customers:** Direct-to-consumer and e-commerce brands that view customer service as a growth driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.
*   **Market Category:** A customer service platform for modern companies that use service as a growth driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.

Their sales narrative emphasizes that customer success is a growth driver, contrasting with competitors who treat it as a cost center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

This detailed process ensures that the product resonates with its intended buyers, leading to increased adoption and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

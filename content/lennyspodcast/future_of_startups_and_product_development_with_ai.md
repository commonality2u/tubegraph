### The Role of AI in its Own Development

AI models need specific interfaces to interact effectively with computers, different from human interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This new discipline, "AI computer interfaces" (ACI), involves designing tools and representations that make it easier for large language models to interact with elements like the shell, package installations, and code editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. ReplIt's agent functions as another user on its multiplayer system, coding alongside a human user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

The development of AI itself is crucial. For example, ReplIt used Anthropic's Sonnet model for coding due to its superior performance, and also leveraged models from OpenAI, as it operates as a multi-agent system with different models performing specific tasks like critique and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. The continuous improvement of foundational models, occurring roughly every six months, drives these advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

This implies that [[developing_ai_products_and_utilizing_technology|AI will become more general and capable]] as it becomes more competent at writing and maintaining software, which underpins much of human life and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

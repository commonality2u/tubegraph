Successful [[pricing_models_and_strategies_for_saas_companies | pricing strategy]] for software products is deeply intertwined with [[product_positioning_strategy | product positioning]] and understanding customer value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.

## Positioning Precedes Pricing

Before determining a [[pricing_models_and_strategies_for_saas_companies | pricing strategy]], it's crucial to establish clear [[product_positioning_strategy | product positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. For example, Superhuman positioned itself as the best email tool for high-performing individuals and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. This focus on the high end of the market allows for a different [[pricing_models_and_strategies_for_saas_companies | pricing approach]] compared to products aiming for mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>.

## Measuring Willingness to Pay

One effective method for developing [[pricing_models_and_strategies_for_saas_companies | pricing]] is the **Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. This method involves asking four key questions to understand [[willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | customer willingness to pay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>:

1.  **Too Expensive:** "At what price would you consider Superhuman to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>
2.  **Too Cheap:** "At what price would you consider Superhuman to be priced so low that you'd be worried about its quality and you wouldn't buy it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>
3.  **Getting Expensive (but still buyable):** "What price would you consider Superhuman to be starting to get expensive so that it's not out of the question, but you'd have to give some thought to buying it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>
4.  **Bargain:** "At what price would you consider Superhuman to be a bargain? A great buy for the money." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>

For Superhuman, the median answer to the third question (starts to feel expensive, but still justifiable after thought) was $30 per month, which became their initial price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>.

### Strategic Price Point Selection

*   **Bargain Price (Point 4):** Most startups, especially in greenfield opportunities or marketplaces, orient around this price point to maximize sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>.
*   **"Getting Expensive" Price (Point 3):** This point supports a "best-in-class" or premium [[product_positioning_strategy | positioning]] where customers consider the investment due to significant ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>. For Superhuman, users save four hours or more per week, get through email twice as fast, and respond one to two days faster, justifying the higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>.

## Market Size and Valuation Considerations

After selecting a price, it's important to perform a gut check on market size and potential valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>. For a venture-scale company, consider if the chosen price allows for growth into target valuations, assuming revenue multiples (e.g., 10x ARR for a $1 billion valuation means $100 million ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. This also involves considering potential for price increases or new product offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>.

## Pricing in Different Contexts

*   **Individual Subscribers:** Incentives like "refer a friend, get a free month" can work well for individual users paying out-of-pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.
*   **Enterprise/Team Subscriptions:** Different motivations are needed when a company is paying for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>. Features that provide genuine multiplayer or collaborative benefits are key for enterprise sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Monetizing Innovation:** For more in-depth learning on [[pricing_models_and_strategies_for_saas_companies | pricing]], "Monetizing Innovation" by Madhavan Ramanujam is a recommended resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.

## Cost Structure and Pricing Feasibility

Certain business strategies, like manual onboarding, can avoid the need to build expensive first-time user experiences or activation growth loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. This allows engineering resources to focus on core [[creating_a_winning_product_strategy | product market fit]] or solution deepening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>. However, this is more feasible when there is "cheap cash to invest" (e.g., during periods of high funding availability, like the zero-interest rate phenomenon era or for some AI companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>. It's crucial to ensure that such investments do not lead to losing money on onboarding, meaning the [[pricing_models_and_strategies_for_saas_companies | pricing]] must support these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.

At a certain scale, the "top of funnel width" for manual onboarding will become too narrow, necessitating a transition to a world-class self-service option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>. The shift to self-service should account for the [[customer_acquisition_cost | LTV (Lifetime Value)]] and [[customer_acquisition_cost | ACV (Annual Contract Value)]] of new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

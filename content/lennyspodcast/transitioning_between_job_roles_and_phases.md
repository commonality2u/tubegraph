Nikhil Singall, a product leader at Meta who has worked on influential consumer products like Facebook, Credit Karma, Google Hangouts, and Google Photos, emphasizes a long-term perspective on [[career_development_and_planning | career progression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. He advises listeners to consider their career as a product, working backward from an end state to define [[career_development_and_progression_strategies | career development and progression strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Early Career Transitions

A common mistake in early career is thinking too short-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Focusing solely on immediate issues like disliking a boss or slow shipping can lead to lateral moves rather than forward progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Avoiding Short-Term Thinking
One of the biggest short-term traps is conflating career growth with promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. While promotion is a system for moving forward within a company, career involves a longer-term arc, potentially looking at the job *after* the next one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Many consider leaving a company soon after a promotion, which highlights a disconnect between the promotion and their true career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### The Value of Diverse Experiences
While collecting impressive company "logos" on a resume might seem valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, it can feel shallow to builders who enjoy creating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Nikhil advocates for a diverse set of experiences, including:
*   Pre-product market fit environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>
*   Seeing "smoke turn into fire" (early growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>
*   Taking "fire and turning it into something great" (scaling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
*   Experience with both internal ("inside the building") and external ("outside the building") problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>
*   Consumer and business-to-business problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>

A diverse career makes one a better builder and often leads to greater satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. For executives, having experience at "Magma" (Meta, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) or similar large-scale companies is particularly important, as they bring expertise in building and managing at scale to smaller, growing organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

### "Ex-Growth Companies"
Nikhil identifies a dangerous type of company: "ex-growth companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. These are companies that raised significant capital during periods of hyper-growth but have since lost momentum, often due to changes in market conditions (e.g., higher interest rates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

Key characteristics of an "ex-growth company" include:
*   Not actively raising new rounds or undergoing significant layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   Still hiring or seeking new products despite a lack of strong product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
*   Having a valuation (hundreds of millions or more) that doesn't align with still searching for product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

For employees, being in such a company offers almost no recourse, especially if a significant portion of compensation is tied to equity that may become worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. The opportunity cost of staying can be too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Signs of lacking product-market fit include:
*   Having to work very hard to acquire users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
*   Absence of a "sucking sound" where customers are naturally drawn to the product with little marketing effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

Reasons to potentially stay at such a company, despite the risks, include:
*   It offering the biggest role one could get, providing significant learning experience (e.g., executive team exposure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.
*   Loyalty and commitment to the team or the "baby" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
However, fear of not finding another job is considered a poor reason to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

### Key Advice for Early Career Product Managers
1.  **Become World-Class in One Area**: Early in your career, aim to pick up and become an expert in one of the various product ambiguities:
    *   Crafting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>
    *   Market ambiguity (navigating markets, creating new things) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>
    *   Organizational ambiguity (solving internal team problems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>
    *   Domain expertise (e.g., ML, hardware) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>
    *   Team expertise (managing managers, balancing teams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>
    *   Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>
    Picking a "lane" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
2.  **Have a Story to Tell**: Think about the narrative you'll tell your next employer about your early jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. Like Amazon writing a press release before building a product, plan the story of your learning and accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

## Mid-Career Transitions

### Reasons for Not Getting Promoted
There are four common reasons people aren't promoted:
1.  **Lack of Advocacy**: No one sees the "magic" in you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. If you have the talent but are in a bad setting, consider shifting projects, finding a new manager, or leaving the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
2.  **No Role Exists**: Especially relevant in current economic climates where companies are laying people off and flattening management layers, the next level job may simply not be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.
3.  **Impatience**: High performers often set aggressive promotion goals (e.g., wanting promotion in one year instead of two) and get frustrated when leadership development takes longer, involving more subtle soft skills and lagging impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.
4.  **Undeveloped Areas**: A development area exists, but the individual may not acknowledge it or want to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. Managers might be poor at identifying it, or the individual might refuse to hear it, feeling it's a challenge to their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

### The Importance of Feedback
To understand if you're not being seen or if there's a real development area, seek "real feedback" rather than formal feedback, especially in scaled companies where formal systems might not capture ground truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. To get better feedback:
*   Cultivate strong listening skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
*   Avoid justifying or refuting feedback immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.
*   Triangulate feedback from various sources: people who see you often, those who don't, and peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
*   Create an environment of safety where people feel no fear of retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
*   Repeat back the feedback to show internalization and understanding, even if it feels difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.
*   As a manager, publicly acknowledge and credit individuals for valuable feedback, showing that it's recognized and appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

### Challenges for New Managers
The tech industry has historically done a poor job of training managers, often promoting based on individual contributor (IC) skills (e.g., a good coder becomes a manager) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. This creates a "loose coupling" between building skills and teaching/managing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

For new managers, two critical pitfalls to avoid are:
1.  **Not Sharing the Steering Wheel**: Management is not about "divide and conquer" or simply "teaching someone to ride a bike" and letting go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. It's more like a sidecar on a motorcycle: you're attached, providing counsel, and sharing responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
2.  **Not Being Invited In**: Managers gain organizational power, but they must earn the right to manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>. Approach it by asking how you can help, recognizing that some direct reports may initially resist a new layer of management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>. Be patient and wait for the moment they need assistance, then partner on specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.

Learning for managers is increasingly found in self-service tools and, most powerfully, in communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. Communities (both internal and external) provide safety, allow for authentic conversations, and enable sharing of best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. Nikhil, for example, created "The Skip CPO Community" for product leaders to connect and share experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.

### The Rise of the Senior IC Path
The growth in the Individual Contributor (IC) track is seen as one of the best developments in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. Historically, ICs were often prematurely promoted to management without proper training, leading to average managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

The IC path allows individuals to:
*   Focus on building and mastering specific skills, such as an "ambiguity master" (e.g., expert in domain, organization, market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.
*   Continue to be a "builder," avoiding the administrative or resource-justification aspects often associated with management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
*   It rectifies a long-standing "bug" in product management where everyone was expected to become a manager, unlike engineering or design fields which have strong IC paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

While the IC tracks are still developing and gaining industry perception, they are becoming increasingly strong and viable options for product professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.

## Late Career Transitions ("Act 3")

### The "Shadows of Superpowers"
As leaders become more senior, their greatest strengths (superpowers) can inadvertently create significant development areas (shadows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. The adage "what gets you here isn't what got you here" applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. For example:
*   Someone who is a great collaborator (superpower) might struggle with collaboration when dealing with senior leaders outside their function, because their collaboration style only worked when others agreed with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
*   Great collaborators might become too reticent to express their own opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.
*   Individuals amazing at growth might struggle with innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.
*   World-class storytellers might struggle with details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.
*   Strong political players might make unprincipled decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.
*   Amazing listeners might be indecisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

These shadows are hard to recognize because they stem from one's identity and past successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. To address this, individuals must listen to contradictory feedback, especially feedback they've previously dismissed as anomalous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. Realizing this can be a critical unlock for overcoming career plateaus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.

### Mental Health Challenges in Late Career
As careers become longer (potentially 60 years or more), many successful individuals, having reached their initial "North Star" (e.g., Vice President, building a company), find themselves lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This phenomenon is compared to greyhound dogs that, upon accidentally catching the mechanical rabbit they were chasing, would never run again because their goal was achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.

Similarly, people spend decades focusing on an "X" goal (e.g., being a VP, having money, starting a company) but fail to consider "what happens next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>. When they achieve their objective, their entire career wiring, centered on reaching that place, leaves them without a new motivating purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>. This can lead to sadness, creating conflict where peace is needed, or unhealthy habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.

### Finding a New North Star
To avoid this, it's crucial to start thinking about a "second thing" or a new North Star for "Act 3" of one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Potential paths for this later stage fall into two broad categories:
1.  **Scaled Economics**: Continuing to pursue financial growth (e.g., investing, private equity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
2.  **Giving**: Focusing on contributing to others, as suggested by Eastern philosophies about happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. While early career stages might be focused on "taking and creating," Act 3 provides an opportunity for "giving" in various forms, such as [[career_development_and_planning | content creation]], volunteering, or starting mission-based companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This path can be more fulfilling and beneficial to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

## General Advice
To ensure a fulfilling [[navigating_career_transitions_and_selfconfidence | career transition]] and progression, focus on crafting a compelling personal story about your current work that is meaningful for your "skip job" – the job after your next one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. This story should highlight problems solved, skills built, headwinds faced, and how you overcame them, using "I" statements to emphasize your individual contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>. A strong personal story leads to [[career_development_and_progression_strategies | career advancement]] regardless of formal promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>.

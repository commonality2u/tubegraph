Natural Language Interface (NLX) is an acronym for the new User Experience (UX), often stated as "NLX is the new UX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. It refers to a conversational interface that leverages natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

## NLX vs. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)

Traditionally, Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) have been explicitly designed because they are not natural ways for humans to interact, leading to rigid interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. In contrast, natural language interfaces are "much more elastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. However, this elasticity does not mean they are undesigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Conversations, like podcasts or meetings, have inherent grammars, structures, and "invisible" UI elements that still require careful design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

The challenge and excitement in NLX lie in defining the new principles and constructs for natural language as an interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

## Key Design Principles in NLX

Several new constructs are emerging in NLX, particularly for [[human_interaction_and_personalization_with_ai_models | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>:

*   **Prompts**
    Prompts are a new UI element, similar to how a dropdown or menu functions in a GUI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Plans**
    When a high-level goal is given to an agent, it can respond with a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Ideally, this plan should be editable, serving as a new interactive construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   **Showing the Work / Progress**
    This refers to the agent "thinking aloud" or demonstrating its process, as seen in products like Copilot or ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. The key is to find the right balance: too verbose, and it feels like a script; too terse, and users lose confidence in its path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. This transparency is particularly valued now because AI models are often black boxes, making any glimpse "under the hood" reassuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   **Proactive Follow-ups**
    Anticipating and suggesting the next obvious actions or questions is crucial for guiding users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. For example, after generating a black and white image, an agent might proactively suggest options to change its color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. Again, balance is essential to avoid being annoying or missing an opportunity to direct the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
*   **[[human_interaction_and_personalization_with_ai_models | Personalization]]**
    The ideal NLX experience will be highly personalized. Just as human interactions differ (e.g., some prefer direct answers, others detailed explanations), AI interfaces will need to adapt to individual user preferences over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

## Impact on Product Development

Designing for NLX requires product builders to think differently about user interaction and information flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. It's a "fun new space to be digging in" for product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. The shift towards natural language interfaces, particularly with [[human_interaction_and_personalization_with_ai_models | agents]], represents a significant evolution in how products will be built and how users will interact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

Historically, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant demonstrated the "opposite problem" where the interface overshot, but the underlying intelligence wasn't fully there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>. Today, the challenge is often the reverse: powerful AI intelligence exists, but the interfaces are still relatively basic, like "AOL dial-up modern chatbot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. This highlights the ongoing need for robust NLX design.

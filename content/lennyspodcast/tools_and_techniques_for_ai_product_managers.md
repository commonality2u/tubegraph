[[ai_in_product_management | AI in product management]] is rapidly evolving, making it easier than ever for product managers to build and iterate on ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This shift empowers product managers (PMs) to be more productive and efficient, potentially leading to a trend of fewer management layers and more individual contributors (ICs) in product roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Types of AI Product Managers
A Product Manager is generally responsible for uniting design, engineering, business, and sales to ship impactful solutions for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Within the realm of AI, there are typically three main "flavors" of [[ai_in_product_management | AI product management]]:
1.  **AI Platform PMs:** These individuals build tools for AI engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. An example is building an observability and evaluation platform for AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This role helps AI engineers understand the impact of their models on business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
2.  **AI Product PMs:** Their core product is centered around AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Examples include products like ChatGPT or NotebookLM, where the core experience is enabled by the underlying model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The PM's job is to package this advanced technology to be consumable by businesses, enterprises, or consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
3.  **[[ai_powered_product_management_skills | AI-Powered Product Managers]]:** This type of PM is enabled by AI technology across their entire role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. They utilize large language models or other AI models to create the best customer experience, even if they aren't building the core models from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:10:12]</a>. This is expected to be a common trend as AI becomes more pervasive, akin to how databases are common in SaaS applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:24]</a>.

Most PMs in the near future are likely to be one of these types of [[ai_in_product_management | AI product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:37]</a>.

## [[tips_for_using_ai_in_product_development | Key Mindsets and Approaches for AI Product Managers]]

### Focus on the Problem, Not Just the AI Solution
A critical aspect of thriving as an [[ai_in_product_management | AI product manager]] is focusing on the problem to be solved, rather than simply applying AI because it's trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:56]</a>.
*   Many companies initially gravitated towards building internal chatbots on their knowledge bases, but the actual usage of these products often isn't well understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:31:21]</a>.
*   The "right" interface for AI might look different from a chatbot; it could involve optimizing or speeding up existing human processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:14]</a>.
*   Avoid the trap of simply trying to fit new technology (like AI agents) to solve a problem without clearly describing the problem first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:43]</a>.
*   [[tips_for_using_ai_in_product_development | AI product managers]] should innovate by applying existing AI technology in novel ways within their organization, rather than trying to build foundational models or new techniques from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:32]</a>.
*   **Rule of thumb:** If a team is building something very similar to a foundational model's product, it might be a red flag; optimize for new and different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:33:00]</a>.

> "Focus on the problem you're solving and AI is a tool to solve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:10]</a>.

### Hands-On Exploration and Prototyping
*   **Build a Portfolio:** It's now easier to break into [[ai_in_product_management | AI product management]] than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Prospective AI PMs should build a portfolio of products they've prototyped with AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:56]</a>. This demonstrates thinking processes and interests to hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   **Hackathons:** Getting people to be hands-on with AI removes the feeling that the technology is unapproachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:41]</a>. Hackathons help teams generate ideas and determine where AI solutions truly "stick" versus where they don't work well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:26]</a>.
*   **Experience AI products firsthand:** Experimenting with cutting-edge AI technology, such as OpenAI's real-time voice API, can lead to "light bulb" moments about what's possible and how it can be applied to existing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:17:39]</a>.

### Embrace Curiosity and Continuous Learning
*   [[how_to_become_an_ai_product_manager | How to become an AI product manager]] often involves being driven by personal curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   Start with fundamentals of machine learning and AI from resources like YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   Combine understanding the technology's capabilities with actively using tools to push its boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   Being a successful [[ai_in_product_management | AI product manager]] means being genuinely curious about the space and staying updated on new tools and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:39]</a>.
*   **"Wandering" vs. "Waiting":** PMs should embrace "wandering" â€“ actively exploring and trying to figure out new directions for the product, even when uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:59">[00:59:05]</a>. This contrasts with "waiting" for new models or clear signals, a common inclination for broader companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:43]</a>.

> "To really stand out as an [[ai_in_product_management | AIPM]] you have to accept this technology is changing really fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:56]</a>.

### The "IKEA Effect" in AI Product Design
Successful AI products often leave some control to the user, similar to the "IKEA effect" where people feel more empowered when they have an impact on the end experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:41:05]</a>. Fully automating a job might not be the best approach if it removes the user's sense of contribution, as seen with Betty Crocker's cake mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:40]</a>.

### Influence and Energy
*   [[impact_of_ai_on_product_teams | AI tooling]] allows PMs to "max out" their influence by effectively communicating ideas to design, engineering, and leadership through prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:58]</a>.
*   Bringing positive "energy" to meetings and interactions can break down barriers and make conversations flow more smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:50:05]</a>.
*   An [[ai_in_product_management | AI product manager]] should be a "player-coach," involved in the details and willing to get hands-on with tough tasks (like cold-messaging potential customers for insights), demonstrating commitment and empathy to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:52:19]</a>.

### Balancing Business Metrics with Exploration
*   [[ai_in_product_management | AI product managers]] are still responsible for moving business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:37:05]</a>.
*   However, a top 5% [[ai_in_product_management | AI product manager]] also makes space for prototyping, trying new tools, conducting hackathons, and breaking down successful AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:44:18]</a>. These exploratory activities may not directly move immediate KPIs but are crucial for learning and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:47]</a>.
*   The goal is to continuously deliver customer value while creating space to iterate and learn from experiments, even failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:47]</a>.

Ultimately, [[ai_in_product_management | AI product management]] is about making the product easier to use and lowering the barrier to creation, rather than simply automating problems away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:42]</a>.

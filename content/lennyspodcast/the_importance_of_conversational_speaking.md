People often adopt a specific "[[tips_for_improving_public_speaking_and_overcoming_fear | public speaking]] voice" when asked to speak formally, even if they chat normally in everyday situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift can cause individuals to enter a "professional version" of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, speaking conversationally is highlighted as being "more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Core Principles

The underlying principle for [[improving_communication_skills | becoming a better speaker]] is that speaking is not a specialized skill but a [[impact_of_speaking_as_a_meta_skill | meta skill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:06">[06:06:06]</a>. This means that as speaking abilities improve, various aspects of one's life, including work, friendships, and family interactions, also improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:09">[07:07:09]</a>.

A key misconception is underestimating how transformative improving one's [[tips_for_improving_public_speaking_and_overcoming_fear | public speaking]] can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:08">[05:55:08]</a>. Humans are naturally evolved to speak; babies learn without formal education, indicating an "incredible hardware" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Over time, "bugs in the software" develop due to various situations, leading to avoidance and hindering growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:17">[08:16:17]</a>. The solution involves debugging and upgrading this "software" to unlock inherent speaking capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:44">[08:43:44]</a>.

### The Barometer of Enjoyment

A fundamental insight is that if you don't enjoy speaking, you're likely doing it wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Enjoyment serves as a barometer: if communication feels enjoyable, it's a sign that things are going right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. When under pressure, people often try to speak differently, attempting to control words and overthink, which is counter-intuitive to natural communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The goal is to feel like oneself, as in conversations with family or friends, where communication is naturally enjoyable and empowering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Speaking as a Subconscious Flow

Speaking is best understood as a subconscious, flow-oriented process rather than a conscious one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. When speaking optimally, one is not thinking about the act of speaking itself, but is "completely in tune with whatever it is I'm trying to convey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>. The aim is to get into and maintain a flow state from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

This perspective shifts focus from symptoms (like filler words or racing speech) to their root causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>. For example, excessive filler words often stem from discomfort with slowing down, relaxing, or pausing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. Addressing these root causes not only eliminates symptoms but also creates more mental space and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>. Monotonous or constrained speaking might indicate a struggle to "be all of what you are under pressure" due to a lack of certainty or trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. By addressing these internal blockages, speakers gain freedom and spontaneity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>.

## Practical Application

A key cue to encourage conversational speaking is to "don't think about us, just think out loud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. This approach reduces the perceived stakes and allows the speaker's mindset to align with their natural skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>. Thinking out loud facilitates connections in the mind, leading to spontaneous and emergent words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>. The ideal is to "discover the words they are saying at the same time their audiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.

Using prompts and cues can further stimulate the brain to generate unanticipated content, much like applying constraints to a creative project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. This approach builds skills that make even prepared talks easier, as it fosters comfort and resilience in communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>.

### Avoiding "Bullshitting"

A common concern with speaking freely is the fear of "bullshitting" or appearing to lack substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>. This fear can act as an "immune response," preventing speakers from freely sharing thoughts or showing confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>. However, if this thought even crosses one's mind, it indicates a refined ability to discern genuine communication from insincerity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>. The aim is to achieve the "bullshitter level of communication" (fluency and confidence) but to back it up with solid ideas and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>. This self-awareness serves as a "compass" to stay true to one's knowledge and avoid actual bullshitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>.

## Training for Conversational Fluency

Training for [[improving_communication_skills | better public speaking]] often involves [[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | games]] and methods that simulate pressure in a low-stakes environment.

### "Conductor" Game

The "Conductor" game helps speakers tap into different energy levels and emotions. Participants are given a random speech title and presented with numbers (1-10) representing intensity levels to match with their voice and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. A "breathe" slide prompts a pause for relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. This [[using_games_for_public_speaking_practice | game]] reveals how tapping into emotion naturally leads to words and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. It helps identify a speaker's comfort level with different intensities, providing a "mirror" to understand their natural tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a>. The goal is to learn to navigate "turbulence" gracefully, building confidence for spontaneous scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

### "Triple Step" Game

The "Triple Step" [[using_games_for_public_speaking_practice | game]] is designed for those who struggle to stay on a single thought or are easily distracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. In this [[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | exercise]], a speaker is given a random topic and must integrate random words or phrases that appear on screen seamlessly into their speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. The objective is to choose a strong direction and maintain focus, allowing the words to work within that direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. This [[using_games_for_public_speaking_practice | game]] builds resilience and the ability to compose oneself amidst distractions, simulating real-life interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. It also serves as a warm-up, activating various parts of the brain necessary for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.

### Conviction Prompts

"Conviction prompts" are used to develop [[improving_communication_skills | executive presence]] and enable speakers to truly believe in what they are saying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>. Speakers are given a topic and then presented with the beginning of a sentence (a prompt) that they must complete, forcing them into a state of greater conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>. For the majority of people, adding more conviction to their words increases the likelihood of their ideas being heard and accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>. This practice demonstrates how conviction can naturally alter content and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.

## The Accordion Method for Talk Preparation

For prepared talks, the "Accordion Method" revolutionizes preparation by focusing on speaking rather than writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. The traditional method involves writing detailed scripts and memorizing them, which is inefficient and prone to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

The Accordion Method involves:
1.  **Dumping ideas:** Optionally, write down initial ideas to get them out of your head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>.
2.  **Compressing:** Speak about the topic for progressively shorter durations (e.g., 3 minutes, then 2, then 1, down to 30 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. The only rules are to maintain character and end strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>. This process forces the speaker to distill content to its "essential pieces," clarifying the core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:49">[01:29:49]</a>.
3.  **Expanding:** After reaching the shortest duration, gradually increase the speaking time back up (e.g., 30 seconds, then 1 minute, 2 minutes, back to 3 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. This allows for intentional reintroduction of supporting details and new elements that align with the refined core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>.

This method results in a clear, intentional talk that is "internalized" rather than merely memorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>. It offers flexibility to adapt to different time frames and reduces the impact of mistakes, as the speaker possesses a deep understanding of their material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:27">[01:31:27]</a>.

## The Bow and Arrow Technique

The "Bow and Arrow" technique is a mindset shift for preparing talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:04">[01:38:04]</a>. Instead of focusing on "what we want to say," speakers should prioritize "what we want our audience to remember" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>. Most audience members only remember "one thing" from a talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>.

1.  **The Arrow:** This is the single sentence or core message that the audience should remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:22">[01:39:22]</a>. Having a clear "arrow" provides a North Star for the talk, guiding content and offering clarity to both the speaker and the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.
2.  **The Bow:** To give the "arrow" impact, it needs "weight," which comes from supporting elements like anecdotes, data points, or [[importance_of_storytelling_in_business_communication | stories]] that add emotion or illustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

The process of clarifying the arrow and bow is iterative, often refined through practice methods like the Accordion Method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:39">[01:40:39]</a>. This technique can be applied at both macro and micro levels; for example, every slide in a presentation should have its own "one thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:22">[01:42:22]</a>. Making the slide title the core takeaway reinforces the message and improves clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:23">[01:43:23]</a>.

Stripe is excited about AI and has been using machine learning (ML) and advanced ML techniques at the core of its products since its early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

## Historical Use of Machine Learning
Stripe's Radar, a solution for payment fraud, has utilized machine learning since its introduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. The company employs ML techniques to identify and combat bad actors, such as fraudsters and fraudulent businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>. Without these techniques, Stripe could not operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.

The company incorporated Transformer technology, which underpins large language models, into these systems over a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>. This has profoundly impacted Stripe's ability to solve problems for its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

## Impact of AI on Business and Technology
Stripe feels privileged to help power and serve many businesses, especially AI startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>. A key difference for AI startups is the high cost of compute resources, necessitating a monetization model from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. Most AI companies leverage Stripe for their monetization, subscriptions, revenue tracking, and financial operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>. For example, OpenAI uses Stripe to monetize ChatGPT Plus and its other products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

Stripe's existing large engineering teams dedicated to financial automation products mean that AI companies can focus their "precious engineering resources" on innovation rather than building complex reconciliation or subscription business models themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

## Applications of Large Language Models (LLMs)
Stripe is actively exploring the [[Impact of AI on software development and deployment | applications of LLM techniques]] to improve service for its users and enhance internal efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.

### Enhanced Documentation
After OpenAI's GPT-4 beta became available, Stripe realized it could use GPT-4 to read all its documentation, store it as embeddings, and answer developer questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. This feature is now available in early release within Stripe's documentation, proving valuable for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.

### Improved Product Functionality (Sigma)
Stripe is applying LLM techniques to its Sigma product, which allows users to write SQL queries across their Stripe data for detailed business insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>. With LLMs, users can now ask questions in natural language, and the system will generate the SQL query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. Significant effort has gone into tuning this feature for reliability and understandability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>.

### Internal Efficiency and [[Impacts of AI on data science and marketplace operations | Data Science]]
LLMs are also used internally to answer user questions faster and facilitate quicker internal assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. Stripe built an internal UI with an integration to GPT-4 to handle sensitive business data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. This system allows for shared prompts (presets) across the company, enabling various job functions, including marketing and user support, to leverage LLMs effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

## [[Impact of AI on coding practices and developer productivity | AI's Impact on Developer Productivity]]
Stripe is enthusiastic about Copilot and has made it widely available to its engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. A rigorous trial confirmed its effectiveness in boosting productivity and allowing engineers to focus on higher-level problems rather than micro-level tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>.

One significant area of [[Impact of AI on developer productivity | productivity gain]] from Copilot is generating test cases, which often involve boilerplate code and concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>. Copilot handles this repetitive generation, allowing engineers to focus on the critical aspects of testing, which is expected to have a profound impact on code quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. The company views AI tools like Copilot as a way to enhance the coding experience, enabling engineers to focus on the "parts that really matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.

## The [[The future of AI in software development | Future of AI]]
Stripe will continue to showcase its innovations around AI and large language models at events like Stripe Sessions, anticipating a significant impact in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>.

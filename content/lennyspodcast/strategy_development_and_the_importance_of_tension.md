Seth Godin, an author and blogger, highlights the critical role of [[understanding the challenges of developing effective business strategies | tension]] in developing effective strategies, particularly in his new book, "This Is Strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. He emphasizes that a great strategy inherently contains tension at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

## The Role of Tension in Strategy

Tension, distinct from stress, is fundamental to every art form and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a>. Stress is generally negative, involving conflicting desires like wanting to leave a job but needing to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:54">[02:29:54]</a>. Tension, however, arises from the possibility that something *might not work* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:14">[02:13:14]</a>.

When a new product is launched with a promise, users imagine how their life might improve if that promise were true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:24">[02:28:24]</a>. If they fall in love with this possibility, a tension is created: "Did you tell the truth? Is it going to work for them?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:40">[02:28:40]</a>. This tension can drive engagement and adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:40">[02:28:40]</a>.

## Four Critical Choices in Strategy

For product developers, certain choices are critical in shaping the product and future, often overlooked or assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:51">[02:32:51]</a>:

1.  **Choose Your Customers**: Deciding on the smallest viable audience—their language, financial capacity, problems, technical facility, and temperament—determines everything about the product and its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. For example, a product for Raspberry Pi enthusiasts (who "wonk" with technology) allows for a different development and engagement process than one aimed at a mass Apple-like audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
2.  **Choose Your Competition**: Understanding who you are competing against sets significant boundaries around what you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Competing with a low-price leader like Walmart means expecting continuous price drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
3.  **Choose Your Source of Validation**: If the goal is to please your boss, that's what will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Instead, alignment should be sought with the boss on pleasing the agreed-upon customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This ensures focus on delighting the intended user, not an internal stakeholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
4.  **Choose Your Distribution**: How a product reaches its users heavily influences its development and market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. For software, shifts like downloadable shareware or platforms like Steam fundamentally alter product requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

These four elements are choices, and glossing over them often stems from fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Building Brands and Remarkability

AI companies, like all companies, need to define what they stand for and what they do not do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. [[understanding the challenges of developing effective business strategies | AI]] is rapidly becoming a feature, not a differentiator, similar to electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. A brand is a promise—what users expect and would miss if it were gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. The key is to make a difficult, remarkable promise and then consistently keep it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Breaking a promise even once can erode trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

### The Purple Cow: Being Remarkable
The concept of the "Purple Cow" or "being remarkable" means being "worth making a remark about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. It's not about creating a viral gimmick, but making something that genuinely improves a person's life and makes them want to talk about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This [[understanding the challenges of developing effective business strategies | customer traction]] and word-of-mouth spread is often the most effective way for products to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Google's early success, for example, stemmed from its simple, effective search that made users want to tell others, raising their own status as tech-savvy individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## Understanding the System for Strategic Thinking

[[Strategy formulation and execution | Strategic thinking]] involves seeing the invisible systems that govern interactions and industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Systems create culture and norms that can protect themselves, sometimes to the detriment of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

*   **Safety is Risky**: If something feels scary, it's often because the existing system wants you to perceive it that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. True [[understanding the challenges of developing effective business strategies | innovation]] requires understanding why a certain action feels scary and whether the system needs to be challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Better Waves Make Better Surfers**: Success often depends more on choosing the right environment or "wave" than solely on individual skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Just as a surfer waits for the optimal wave, a company should choose its market and partners carefully to maximize its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Prioritizing impact over imaginary deadlines helps avoid shipping mediocre work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Leadership and Empathy

The essence of [[leadership_and_management_development | leadership]] lies in doing what you believe, painting a picture of the future, and going there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. However, this future must be based in empathy: painting a picture of *where they (the audience) want to go*, not where you want to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Professionals should focus on being of service, opening doors for people to reach their desired destinations, rather than trying to change what people want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

## What are Tarpit Ideas?
"Tarpit ideas" are a concept used to describe startup ideas that appear to be unsolved problems and receive considerable positive feedback, yet founders frequently get stuck in them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> These ideas are "consistently bad startup ideas that people continue to try to start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a> because they are "super appealing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a> and can garner initial validation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>

A true tarpit idea is not simply a difficult idea, but one that:
*   Many people independently conceive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>
*   Seems like an unsolved problem. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>
*   Generates a lot of positive feedback. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>
*   Has strong arguments supporting it as a good startup idea. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>

This differs from a "bad startup idea," which is something "obviously bad or something where you just can't get any positive feedback on." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>

### Why are they called Tarpits?
They are called "tarpits" because they draw you in and you get stuck, due to the initial positive feedback and the perception that they are good ideas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>

## Examples of Tarpit Ideas
Common examples of tarpit ideas include:
*   **Apps to coordinate with friends** – Such as deciding where to go out or meet up. These ideas often receive enthusiastic validation (e.g., "Would you like an app for us to coordinate to hang out more so we can be friends? They're like, yeah I would love that") but have been tried since the 1990s. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>
*   **Music discovery platforms** – This was a personal experience for Dalton Caldwell with his first startup. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a> While they can get positive feedback and users, inherent aspects make them "very hard." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>
*   **Foursquare clones** – Startups attempting to replicate Foursquare's model were prevalent for a time, but many failed or pivoted as Foursquare itself evolved into a B2B business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>

## Avoiding Tarpit Ideas
To avoid falling into the trap of tarpit ideas, founders should:
*   **Diversify their "information diet"**: If founders consume the same podcasts, Twitter feeds, and blog posts, they will likely generate similar startup ideas and philosophies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>
*   **Go off the beaten path**: Seek ideas that are less conventional. This can come from:
    *   **Personal experience and expertise**: As seen with companies like Brex and Retool, whose successful pivots leveraged founders' prior fintech or internal tool-building experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a> A good pivot is like "going home" to something warmer and closer to one's expertise. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>
    *   **Unique personal interests**: For instance, marketplaces for niche collectibles like Funko Pops might not be an obvious idea for others. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>
    *   **Unpopular but large markets**: For example, Zip's founders sought out publicly traded or private equity-owned companies with large markets but low customer satisfaction, leading them to procurement software, which was not a common startup idea at the time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>

[[Elements of breakthrough startup ideas | Breakthrough startup ideas]] often come from founders grinding for years and becoming experts on problems that emerge from earlier ideas, leading to unique insights. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a> It's not always necessary to have that experience before starting the company; it can be gained through the process of building a company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>

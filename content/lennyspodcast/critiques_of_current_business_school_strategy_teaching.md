Many individuals struggle with [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategy]] due to several factors, including educational shortcomings and the nature of the discipline itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Roger Martin, a renowned strategy advisor, offers a strong critique of how strategy is currently taught and practiced, particularly in business schools.

## General Challenges in Strategy
Strategy is an "intellectually challenging" and "emotionally intimidating" endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It requires making integrated choices where answers to various questions must align and reinforce one another, making it more complex than simple decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The emotional intimidation stems from the need to choose certain paths while cutting off others, leading to accountability for those decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Flaws in Academic Strategy Teaching
According to Martin, what is taught in strategy within business schools "generally sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. He argues that the field has adopted a "crazy theoretical bent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, with a dominant theory called the "resource-based view of the firm" (RBV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### The Problem with Resource-Based View (RBV)
Martin describes the RBV as "silly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> and claims "nobody uses it out in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. He attributes its prominence to academic "jealousy" towards Michael Porter, who introduced foundational [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategy]] concepts in his 1980 book *Competitive Strategy* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

Academics caricatured Porter's work as the "positioning school," falsely claiming he advocated for finding structurally attractive positions and "milking it for everything you can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. In contrast, the RBV suggests strategy is "all about building resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, implying "if you build it they will come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

However, Martin points out a critical flaw: the RBV is "silent" on how to strategically choose *what* resources to invest in building, rendering it a "dumb Theory" with nothing useful to say on the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Students attempting to apply RBV (e.g., using VRIO analysis) are often met with skepticism in the business world, as it's rarely used in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Academic Dogma and Loyalty Tests
Martin's own [[practical_application_of_strategic_thinking_in_business | strategy]] approach, which emphasizes balancing "where to play" and "capabilities," is "illegal to teach" in most leading business schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Even as a successful dean at the Rotman School of Management, he was not permitted to teach his methodology for credit, only in extracurricular sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

He highlights a "loyalty test" in academia:
> "If asked the question do you swear allegiance to the resource-based view of the firm if you don't answer an enthusiastic yes you have no chance of being hired zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

This academic drama, with its focus on theoretical purity over practical application, leads to students being unprepared for real-world strategic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Disconnect in Consulting Firms
Beyond academia, strategy consulting firms also contribute to the problem. Martin states that "the so-called strategy consulting firms do almost no strategy anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. They prioritize larger, more lucrative projects like post-merger integration or digital transformation over genuine strategic formulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Lack of Practical Experience in Academia
Martin also suggests that many business academics, like Richard Rumelt, "don't know much about business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a> because they haven't practiced it extensively. He recounts an instance where Rumelt's example of Proctor & Gamble's strategy was "completely utterly absolutely wrong" based on Martin's direct consulting experience with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

This practical disconnect further impedes the effective teaching and development of strategic thinking.

## The Path to Betterment
Despite these critiques, Martin emphasizes that being a "great strategist" is not an innate talent but a skill developed through consistent practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. He states, "I have never met this mythical beast called a great natural strategist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. Instead, successful strategists, like former P&G CEO A.G. Lafley, accumulate "reps" over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

Martin advocates for a "betterment over perfection" approach to strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>, focusing on solving the "single most painful gap" between current and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. This iterative problem-solving, even if small, leads to continuous improvement and strengthens strategic muscles over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

> "If you do that, you'll be a great strategist. So be encouraged, don't be discouraged and the worst thing to do is to wait." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>.

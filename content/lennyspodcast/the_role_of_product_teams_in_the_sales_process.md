Many product leaders possess limited experience in [[building_infrastructure_and_processes_for_productled_sales | building a sales team]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:33">[01:30:33]</a>. However, in B2B, selling is fundamentally about solving problems, not merely selling commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. This requires a deep understanding of the product and the customer's needs, making the product team's involvement crucial.

## Foundational Involvement: Product as "Middlers"

Even if founders or product leaders dislike sales, they are often excellent "middlers" in the sales process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>. This means they excel at discussing the product and market with potential customers, bridging the gap that many sales representatives might struggle with beyond basic questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Founders, and by extension product leaders, possess an inherent advantage as they can answer customer questions about product functionality that many sales reps cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>. This deep product knowledge can significantly outperform competitors' sales teams who rely on brand and integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>.

The initial [[hiring_and_roles_in_product_management | sales hires]] should be "product gurus" or "product experts" who understand the product deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:36">[02:34:36]</a>. This product-centric approach is vital in the early days when a startup's product may have feature gaps but possesses a "10x feature" that drives purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">[02:07:08]</a>.

## Strategic Involvement of Product Leadership

### Head of Product in Sales Deals
In well-run B2B organizations, the Head of Product (or VP of Product) should be deeply involved in sales, especially with major customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:22">[02:10:22]</a>. Their presence in critical sales meetings provides unique advantages:
*   **Deep Product Knowledge:** They understand the product's intricacies and can address complex customer requirements that a sales rep might not know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:06">[02:11:06]</a>.
*   **Commitment Authority:** Unlike sales reps, the product leader can make direct commitments regarding the roadmap, potentially tweaking UI or deconstructing product elements to secure a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:21">[02:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:44">[02:12:44]</a>.
*   **Strategic Weapon:** A product leader with gravitas becomes a strategic asset, providing CEO-level scale and expertise that a VP of Sales cannot always replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:37">[02:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:56">[02:12:56]</a>.

> [!WARNING] If a VP of Product or sales does not express a desire to meet with customers within their first 14 days, it's a red flag for their potential effectiveness in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:26">[02:36:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:42">[02:44:42]</a>.

### Managing Feature Requests from Sales
[[Collaborative_dynamics_between_product_and_sales_teams | Tension between product and sales]] is often a sign of a well-run B2B company engaged in enough deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. However, this tension needs structured management to prevent it from becoming debilitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:16">[02:18:16]</a>.

A practical approach to managing sales feature requests is to:
*   **Allocate a Quarterly Budget:** Give the Head of Sales a specific budget (e.g., 10% of story points or resources) for product development each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:41">[02:14:41]</a>. This forces sales leadership to prioritize requests and understand the trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:51">[02:14:51]</a>.
*   **Weekly Meetings:** The VP of Sales and VP of Product should hold weekly meetings to discuss this budget, current progress, and future planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:05">[02:16:05]</a>.
*   **Product's Voice:** Product leaders must be objective, explaining the costs of mid-quarter changes and the impact on the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:20">[02:16:20]</a>.
*   **Leadership-level Decisions:** Individual contributors (PMs and AEs) should push significant roadmap decisions up to their respective managers, ensuring that the VP of Product and VP of Sales hash out priorities at their level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:53">[02:17:53]</a>.

### Product-Led Growth and Customer Focus
In [[understanding_productled_sales_and_its_differences_from_traditional_sales | product-led growth]] (PLG) companies, product teams are increasingly expected to take on P&L responsibilities and revenue goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:32">[02:10:32]</a>. While alignment with revenue is desired, "weaponizing" product teams for short-term revenue gains can lead to customer-hostile practices, such as "dark patterns" or unearned price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:09">[02:22:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:54">[02:25:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:56">[02:35:56]</a>.

> [!INFO] Software products that offer a free edition are generally better, as they require investment in [[building_infrastructure_and_processes_for_productled_sales | onboarding]] and user experience, benefiting all customers, including Enterprise clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:50">[02:47:50]</a>.

Product teams should focus on being the "voice of the customer," advocating for customer-centric policies like longer free trials or flexible payment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:28">[02:32:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:58">[02:39:58]</a>. This focus on customer happiness and long-term compounding revenue is more crucial than short-term monetization tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:54">[02:25:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Product leaders should aim to "ship three great things this year" rather than many mediocre ones. Delivering truly impactful products inspires the entire company and re-injects lost energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:30">[02:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

Ultimately, while sales drives immediate revenue, the product team's deep understanding of the customer, ability to innovate, and commitment to product quality are fundamental to long-term success and growth in B2B SaaS.

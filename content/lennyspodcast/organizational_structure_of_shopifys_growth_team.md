Shopify's Growth team, led by VP Product and Head of Growth Archie Abrams, is a large organization comprising over 600 people across product, design, engineering, data, operations, and growth marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This [[hiring_philosophies_and_organizational_structure_in_tech_startups | organizational structure]] is designed to drive [[growth_strategies_at_shopify | Shopify's growth]] by focusing on the end-to-end customer journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

## Core Structure

The growth organization at Shopify is broadly divided into two main groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>:

1.  **Growth R&D**: This group encompasses traditional product teams, including product, design, engineering, and data functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
2.  **Growth Marketing**: This team handles various marketing channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

### Growth R&D Pillars

Within the Growth R&D group, there are three primary pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>:

*   **Growth Product**: This pillar focuses on the entire merchant lifecycle, from initial touchpoints to ongoing engagement. Its responsibilities include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>:
    *   Landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>
    *   Sign-up flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>
    *   Onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>
    *   Monetization strategies, such as trial incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>
    *   The "home feed" and other engagement initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>
    The goal of this team is to bring new users onto the platform and ensure their continued success, encouraging them to keep trying entrepreneurship and become larger businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

*   **Ad Pillar (Tools)**: This pillar is dedicated to building internal tools that serve both the Growth team and the broader Shopify organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. Key tools include:
    *   The experimentation platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>
    *   The communication platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>
    *   Business intelligence tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>
    *   MarTech work to support the growth marketing team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>

*   **Customer Support Group**: Uniquely, Shopify's customer support group is integrated within the growth organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. This placement ensures that customer support is seen as an integral part of the merchant's journey, from starting out to scaling into a multi-billion dollar business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. The team focuses on building tools and experiences for merchants, such as making support advisors "superheroes" and developing AI features for self-service in the Help Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.

### Growth Marketing Channels

The Growth Marketing team operates with a more traditional channel-based setup, including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>:

*   Paid acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>
*   Media buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>
*   Affiliate marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>
*   Email marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>
*   Content marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>
*   SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>

## Metric and Goal Alignment

Unlike many companies where every team is tied to specific KPIs, Shopify's approach to metrics is distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. While core product teams don't have KPIs and make decisions based on "taste and intuition" toward a long-term vision, the [[organizational structure of Shopifys growth team | growth team]] focuses on driving absolute numbers rather than conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

Instead of optimizing for conversion rates through specific funnel stages, the growth team is incentivized to think about the *total number of people* who complete their part of the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. This prevents teams from implicitly making earlier funnel steps harder just to improve their local conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

The highest-level metric for the growth team is the **total cohort value** (GMV - Gross Merchandise Volume) generated by a group of merchants over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, measured against payback guardrails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. This long-term focus on GMV as a power-law based metric means that a few highly successful merchants can make an entire cohort profitable, even if many others churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

For individual experiments, the growth team looks at leading indicators but emphasizes long-term monitoring, often revisiting experiments a year or more later to assess their impact on GMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. An internal system sends updated results to experimenters at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to ensure accountability for long-term outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

## Collaboration and Dynamics

The growth team works in partnership with the core product teams, despite their intentionally different time horizons and approaches to product building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. While growth aims for faster shipping and driving metrics, core product is focused on a 100-year vision and building the "right technical foundation" for the future of commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. This creates a healthy tension that fosters high-quality work and allows the growth team to ship high-quality products that are consistent with Shopify's long-term product vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

### Collaboration with Sales

Shopify has layered on a sales motion to its historically product-led growth model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>. The growth team collaborates with sales by:

*   Building empathy and understanding the challenges faced by the sales and merchant success teams in onboarding large customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:39">[01:02:39]</a>. This leads to developing tools like import functions and providing appropriate in-product guidance for different use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.
*   Creating hybrid merchant journeys where users can seamlessly move between self-service and sales-driven paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. This requires significant work in rethinking metrics and attribution models to properly value different touchpoints across the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>.

### Marketing Structure Without a CMO

Shopify operates without a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. Instead, marketing functions are embedded across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>:

*   Growth marketing sits within the growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.
*   Revenue marketing is closer to sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
*   A brand team operates under the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.
*   Product Marketing Managers (PMMs) are embedded with product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.
*   There's also a Shop marketing team focused on the consumer side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>.

This decentralized approach ensures that marketing efforts are closely tied to their most relevant outcomes, allowing for faster movement and less coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>. It works due to the strong intuition of leadership (like Toby and Harley) regarding the brand's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a>.

## Hiring Philosophy

Shopify is a fully remote tech company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. The growth team is actively [[hiring_for_growth_roles_in_startups | hiring]] across all functions, including growth marketers, Product Managers (PMs), engineers, data professionals, and UXers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.

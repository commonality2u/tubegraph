Hiring and developing growth leaders is a critical, yet often misunderstood, aspect of [[company_growth_and_scaling_challenges | company growth]]. Elena Verna, a renowned expert in growth strategy, emphasizes that the process of building growth capabilities should be an evolution, not a revolution [00:52:18].

## Elena Verna's Career Path: A Model for Growth Leadership Development

Elena Verna's own career trajectory serves as an example of strategic pivots and continuous learning, ultimately leading her to become a top growth leader [00:05:05].

Her journey included:
*   Starting in **data analytics** after graduating with a statistics degree from UC Berkeley [00:05:11].
*   Working at a large company (Safeway) and quickly realizing its velocity didn't match her expectations [00:05:42].
*   Joining SurveyMonkey as its first data hire, a position she pursued for over eight months, indicating a strong desire for a place of learning and doing [00:05:56].
*   Growing within data roles from senior analyst to director [00:06:31].
*   Being proactive in managing up and seeking more opportunities [00:06:54].
*   Building a succession plan for her team, allowing her to take on new challenges [00:07:00].
*   Experimenting with product marketing, realizing it wasn't her "superpower" [00:07:12].
*   Initially being apprehensive about the concept of a growth team, believing it to be a "Silicon Valley myth" [00:07:55].
*   Taking on the opportunity to lead growth product, then expanding into growth marketing and analytics at SurveyMonkey, forming a "perfect Trio" for impactful growth [00:08:24].
*   Transitioning to interim leadership and advisory roles, allowing her to understand different teams and industries and optimize for career retention [00:09:07].

Her most fulfilling professional experience was at SurveyMonkey, where she grew with the company, adjusting to new challenges and market shifts, leading to significant learning [00:13:43]. The most challenging was at Miro due to its hyper-growth and navigating the COVID transition, which required full repositioning and re-messaging [00:14:19]. These experiences highlight that challenging moments often lead to the most fulfilling outcomes [00:15:00].

## Challenges in Growth Leadership Roles

Growth leadership faces unique challenges:
*   Growth roles often sit "in between" traditional Chief Product Officer (CPO) and Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) functions, leading to an undefined space in the market [00:16:37].
*   [[career_development_and_growth_strategies | Leadership career ladders]] have not kept pace with what growth professionals actually do [00:16:53].

## Advice on Hiring Growth Leaders

Elena Verna offers specific advice for [[hiring_and_retaining_top_talent_in_tech | hiring]] for growth roles:

### When to Hire a Growth Person
A company should only consider hiring a growth person once it has achieved a strong **product-market fit** [00:52:28]. This means:
1.  **Retention:** There is measurable customer retention, ideally after at least six months to a year post-initial offering [00:55:33].
2.  **Acquisition and Monetization Ability:** There are "green shoots" indicating the ability to acquire and monetize customers and drive product distribution [00:55:50].

Hiring a growth person to *figure out* the growth model from the beginning is a mistake, as it's a fundamental responsibility of the founding team to create the first growth model [00:56:10].

### Internal vs. External Hires
Elena is a strong proponent of finding the first growth hire **internally** [00:52:29].
*   **Benefits of Internal Hires:**
    *   **Familiarity:** Internal candidates are already familiar with the product and its specific growth model [00:52:55].
    *   **Authenticity:** Growth models should be authentic and local to the product offering, making external copy-pasting of previous company models ineffective (99% rejection rate) [00:53:03].
    *   **Quick Wins:** Internal hires can often deliver quick wins [00:53:36].
*   **Risks of External Hires (especially for the first hire):**
    *   **Lack of Familiarity:** External hires need significant time (3-6 months or longer) to understand the product and its growth model [00:52:51].
    *   **Copy-Pasting:** If pressured to accelerate growth quickly, external hires might default to copy-pasting strategies from past experiences, which rarely works [00:54:05]. Even strategies from direct competitors might not work due to differing product functions and market intertwining [00:54:23].
    *   **High Failure Rate:** Copy-pasting patterns have an "extremely high failure rate" [00:54:52].
    *   **Short Tenure:** This often leads to the external hire parting ways with the company within one to two years without a "step function change" in growth [00:53:56].

Organizations should evolve to have a growth mindset [00:52:21]. Potential internal candidates include FP&A analysts, existing product managers, data analysts, or engineers who are connected to the business and technically inclined [00:52:31].

### The "Try Before You Buy" Approach to Leadership
Elena advocates for a "try before you buy" approach for leadership roles, whether starting as an advisor or an interim leader before converting to a full-time position [00:09:13].
*   This approach is ideal for optimizing retention in leadership roles [00:12:57].
*   Traditional leadership hiring (via recruiting agencies or direct CEO outreach) is seen as "broken" [00:12:04].
*   It's a significant bet for the leader on the company, often riskier than the company's bet on the leader [00:12:08].
*   Both parties tend to "sell rainbows and unicorns" during the recruiting process, avoiding discussions about existing problems and potential mismatches [00:12:33].
*   Interim gigs allow leaders to:
    *   Gain accountability [00:11:12].
    *   Help the company understand the type of leader needed [00:10:59].
    *   Keep operations moving [00:11:03].
    *   Actively work to find and transition to their successor [00:11:05].

## General Tips for Driving Growth
To effectively drive growth, leaders and teams need to:
*   **Find Patterns:** Understand how to identify patterns in the problems being solved [00:57:07].
*   **Frameworks over Success Points:** Focus on creating frameworks for problem-solving rather than just copying past "success points" or patterns [00:54:44]. Frameworks make scaling, repeating, and sustaining growth much easier [00:57:25].
*   **Minimize Context Switching:** Reduce constant shifts between different optimization problems (e.g., funnel optimization, conversion rate, loop setup) [00:57:57].
*   **Understand the Growth Model:** Move beyond just thinking about conversion rates and revenue, and truly understand the underlying growth framework [00:57:46].

This approach fosters a repeatable, sustainable, and competitively defensible growth model, driving a strong growth culture and mindset across the company [00:58:01].

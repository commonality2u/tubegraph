Many people tend to adopt a "public speaking voice" when addressing an audience, even in a classroom setting, rather than speaking conversationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This professional persona is often less freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective than simply [[conversational_public_speaking_techniques | speaking conversationally]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

[[Improving public speaking skills | Becoming a better speaker]] is considered a significant accelerant for one's professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The Ultra Speaking course, co-created by Tristan de Bellis, aims to quickly build skills and comfort in [[improving_public_speaking_skills | public speaking]], particularly for impromptu situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Many find [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | public speaking]] daunting, but effective training can make a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Why Speaking is a "Meta-Skill"

A common misconception is underestimating how transformative improving one's speaking ability can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Speaking is a "meta-skill" â€” meaning that as you get better at speaking, your entire life tends to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This is likened to fitness: enhancing physical fitness not only improves muscle and cardiovascular health but also boosts energy, hormone levels, and confidence, leading to broader life improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Breakthroughs in speaking can positively affect how you feel at work, among friends, with strangers, and even within your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Humans are naturally evolved to speak; babies learn without formal education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Our "hardware" for speaking is incredible, but over time, "bugs" in our "software" (due to anxieties and overthinking) can hinder this natural ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The key is to debug and upgrade this software to unlock the inherent superpower of communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## The Problem with Traditional Approaches to Public Speaking

A core insight for [[improving_public_speaking_skills | public speaking]] is that if you don't enjoy speaking, you're likely approaching it incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Enjoyment serves as a barometer: if it's not enjoyable, something is probably wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Communication, when natural and comfortable (e.g., with friends or family), is enjoyable and empowering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. However, in business settings, pressure often leads people to try speaking differently, overthinking words and trying to control them to avoid mistakes, which is counter to natural subconscious communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

The biggest misconception is treating speaking as a conscious process, rather than a subconscious, flow-oriented one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. When speaking best, one is not thinking about the act of speaking, but rather focused on conveying meaning to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The goal is to enter and maintain a flow state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[01:08:04]</a>. This shift in mindset changes how one approaches practice; instead of focusing on symptoms (like filler words), one should address root causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. For example, filler words and racing speech often stem from an inability to feel comfortable slowing down, relaxing, or pausing under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Addressing this root cause resolves the symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Similarly, monotonous or constrained speaking can be due to a lack of trust in allowing oneself to be more expressive under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

Practice must also be enjoyable to be sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Otherwise, people tend to quit after a short period, much like with a restrictive diet or an unenjoyable fitness routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## The Power of "Games" for Practice

You cannot get better at speaking without speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. While people intuitively understand this for skills like cooking (you can't just read cookbooks, you need to cook), in speaking, there's a tendency to avoid direct practice, perhaps due to fear or limited opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

Games are a key component of effective [[techniques_for_enhancing_public_speaking_skills | public speaking practice]]:
1.  **Fun:** Games are enjoyable, providing intrinsic reward that helps sustain practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.
2.  **Short, Deliberate Practice:** They involve short "reps" followed by immediate feedback, allowing for quick adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. This rapid feedback loop helps internalize lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.
3.  **Encourage Spontaneity:** Early coaching revealed that overthinking worsened performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. Games like "Conductor" and "Triple Step" are designed to get people speaking immediately, reducing the tendency to overthink and allowing natural communication to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.
4.  **Create "Turbulence":** Games intentionally create pressure or "turbulence" (like a flight simulator in bad weather) to highlight areas needing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>. This allows individuals to practice recovering gracefully from mistakes, a hallmark of a professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.
5.  **Build Resiliency:** Hard exercises like "Triple Step," where unexpected words must be integrated into a spontaneous talk, force the brain to adapt and build resilience to distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>. This transfers to real-world scenarios, making interview questions or unexpected challenges less daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.
6.  **Warm-up:** Games like "Triple Step" and "Rapid Fire Analogies" can serve as excellent warm-ups for the brain before important meetings, interviews, or presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.

Traditional methods, like simply giving more talks or presentations, are too broad to build specific skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. Games, however, isolate specific skills, allowing focused repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. They expand one's "communication box," making them more comfortable and at ease, which unlocks natural communication abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>.

### Example Games
*   **Conductor:** Speakers react to random numbers (1-10) representing energy levels, forcing them to match their speaking intensity. A "breathe" prompt indicates a required pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. This helps access different insights and memories tied to emotional states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.
*   **Triple Step:** While speaking on a random topic, specific words or phrases appear, which the speaker must seamlessly integrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. This builds mental agility and the ability to maintain focus amidst distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>.
*   **Conviction Prompts:** Speakers integrate specific phrases (e.g., "This matters a ton," "It astonishes me when...") into their speech on a random topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>. These prompts are designed to induce a state of higher conviction, enhancing executive presence and the belief in one's own words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>. Most people tend not to fully stand behind their words, which can hinder the acceptance of their ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.

## Key Principles for Effective Practice

*   **Don't "Leak" Insecurities:** Speakers often self-sabotage by revealing internal doubts or anxieties ("I don't know if that makes sense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. Audiences cannot see what you feel unless it's explicitly shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Sharing insecurities forces the audience to view the speaker through that lens, making small errors seem significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. The solution is to put your best foot forward, stay in character, and avoid revealing internal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. This reinforces confidence as the audience reacts positively to the outward appearance of composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
*   **End Strong:** People tend to "end weak" by slowing down or expressing doubt at the conclusion of their statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This can diminish the overall positive impression, similar to a smooth flight with a terrible landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Anticipate this tendency and ensure a strong finish, either by simply making the ending sound conclusive or by using "summary prompts" (e.g., "So to wrap up...") that prompt the brain to deliver a clear conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
*   **"Think Up":** A simple, practical tip is to look up when gathering thoughts instead of looking down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Looking down can convey uncertainty, especially on video calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Looking up, by contrast, makes you appear thoughtful and confident, reducing the likelihood of interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Think Out Loud:** Instead of overthinking, focus on "thinking out loud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. This helps bridge the gap between a high skill set and a constrained mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>. When thinking out loud, spontaneous insights emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>, allowing one to discover words at the same time as the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>.
*   **Beware of "Bullshitter" Alarm:** The fear of becoming a "bullshitter" (someone who speaks well but lacks substance) can lead to an "immune response" that prevents people from speaking freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>. However, if this thought is present, it means you have a developed skill for noticing when communication is inauthentic. This inner "listener" can guide you to speak effectively while staying true to your message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>.

### Methods for Talk Preparation

*   **Accordion Method:** This method for preparing structured talks revolutionizes traditional script-writing and memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:13">[01:24:13]</a>.
    *   **Old Way (Problematic):** Dumping ideas on paper, rearranging them, then painfully turning them into a script to memorize. Memorization is unreliable, like a chain that breaks if one link is missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.
    *   **New Way (Accordion Method):** Prepare by *speaking* rather than writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.
        1.  **Down the Accordion:** Start with a longer talk (e.g., 3 minutes) and gradually compress it through successive, strict time limits (e.g., 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:39">[01:28:39]</a>. Each step forces you to shed unnecessary "noise" and identify the "essential pieces" of your message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>.
        2.  **Up the Accordion:** Once the core message is distilled to its essence (e.g., 30 seconds), gradually expand back up to the original time limit (e.g., 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. This allows for intentional reintroduction of supporting elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** This process creates extreme clarity, internalizes the talk (rather than just memorizing a script), and makes it adaptable to different time frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>. It's like redecorating a room by first removing everything but the essentials to understand the vision, then intentionally bringing back or adding elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>. For prepared talks, you might have just four bullet points: your core message (arrow) and three key supporting points (bow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>.
*   **Bow and Arrow Technique:** This is a mindset shift for preparing talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:04">[01:38:04]</a>.
    *   **Problem:** Speakers often focus too much on *what they want to say* rather than *what they want the audience to remember* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>. Audiences typically remember only one thing from a talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>.
    *   **Solution:** Identify your "arrow" â€“ a single, powerful sentence that is the *only* thing you want your audience to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10">[01:39:10]</a>. This acts as a clear North Star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.
    *   **Adding "Bow":** To give the arrow impact, you need to "pull the bow back" by adding supporting elements like anecdotes, data points, or stories that add emotion and illustrate your core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:55">[01:39:55]</a>.
    *   **Application:** This technique can be applied to an entire talk or even individual slides. For each slide, determine the "one thing" you want people to remember; if there isn't one, the slide might be unnecessary or too dense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:26">[01:42:26]</a>. A useful [[strategies_for_effective_public_speaking_and_reducing_nervousness | strategy]] is to make the slide title *exactly* that one key takeaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:23">[01:43:23]</a>.

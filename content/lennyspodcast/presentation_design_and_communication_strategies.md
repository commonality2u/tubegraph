Nancy Duarte, best-selling author, speaker, and CEO of Duarte Incorporated, emphasizes that effective communication and [[crafting_compelling_presentations | presenting well]] are crucial in any moment of influence, not just on a big stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Her company has developed over 250,000 presentations for influential business leaders and brands like Apple, Google, and the World Bank, and famously collaborated with Al Gore on "An Inconvenient Truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Duarte Incorporated began when Nancy's husband, an illustrator, saw the business potential in the new Macintosh computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Initially named Duarte Desktop Publishing and Graphic Design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, they secured early contracts with NASA, Tandem (now HP), and Apple through cold calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. They capitalized on an 18-month period when established graphic designers refused to use Macintosh, viewing it as a "toy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

The most memorable project for Duarte was Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth," which predated TED Talks on the web and introduced many to powerful data storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Gore spent five years traveling and planting "seeds for a groundswell" by delivering the talk privately before its cinematic release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Core Principles for Effective Presentations

Nancy Duarte outlines three foundational principles for [[crafting_compelling_presentations | crafting compelling presentations]]:

1.  **Make the Listener the Hero** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
2.  **Infuse Your Talk with Story** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>
3.  **Ask Yourself: "Can They See What I'm Saying?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>

### 1. Audience as the Hero (Empathy-Centric Approach)

Empathy is at the core of Duarte's methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The audience, not the presenter, is the hero because they hold the power to accept or reject an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The presenter acts as a "mentor," coming alongside the audience to help them overcome internal conflicts and empower them to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

> "When you're speaking to an audience they're going to have an internal conflict that you have to give them something to soothe and then you're asking them to therefore go and do this thing take this action do this call to action that's asking them to physically do something or physically change in some way so they're not going to do that for you if you have an empathetically thought about how hard what you're asking them is going to be for them to do." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>

To embody this, Duarte's company conducts "listening tours" (surveys, interviews) before annual vision talks to understand the audience's current state and concerns. They then compare this to their desired outcomes, performing a gap analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. They also present rough cuts of talks to internal leaders for feedback, refining the message to resonate deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

A sign of successful empathy-driven presentations is visible audience engagement, such as positive reactions and word-of-mouth promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Apple's "Think Different" campaign is an example of making the audience the hero, focusing on their individuality and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

### 2. Infuse Your Talk with Story

[[storytelling_and_drawing_in_product_management | Storytelling]] is a powerful tool for influence. [[effective_communication_structures_for_speaking | Story structures]] (like the three-act structure) are deeply ingrained in the human brain, capable of aligning listeners' thoughts with the speaker's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Stories create "longing" for a desired future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

Nancy Duarte's visual framework for [[effective_communication_structures_for_speaking | compelling presentations]] involves a dynamic "What Is / What Could Be" contrast:
*   **What Is:** The current reality or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.
*   **What Could Be:** The imagined future or solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   **New Bliss:** The ultimate desired future state with the idea adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

This pattern, observed in historical speeches like Steve Jobs's iPhone launch and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, creates tension and release, guiding the audience toward a new reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. This framework can be applied even in brief interactions, such as daily conversations or phone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.

### 3. Ask Yourself: "Can They See What I'm Saying?"

[[visualization_techniques_for_public_speaking | Visual tools]] are key to ensuring the audience grasps the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

*   **Star Moments:** Incorporate dramatic data, evocative stories, or powerful images that create lasting memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.
*   **Diagrams and Visualizations:** Especially in tech, diagrams help align understanding of complex systems, product architecture, or processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Drawing on the Fly:** In meetings, spontaneously drawing on a whiteboard or napkin can immediately clarify complex ideas and foster shared understanding and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.

> "When people can see that and it accompanies your verbal narrative that you can actually understand what you're conveying and and move on if you only had a verbal narrative it wouldn't work as well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>

Sometimes, having no visuals is the most impactful choice, forcing the audience to focus entirely on the speaker's words, body language, and passion, allowing the words to paint pictures in their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.

## Practical Tips for Slide Design

*   **One Idea Per Slide:** Each slide should convey a single point that supports the presentation's overall "big idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.
*   **Audience Journey:** The entire presentation should be structured around the audience's journey, moving them from their current state to a desired future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.
*   **Slide Docs:** For presentations circulated via email without a live presenter, "slide docs" are effective. These contain more text, stronger pictures, and often a comprehensive appendix, similar to Amazon's six-page memos but with visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.
*   **Avoid Repurposing Old Slides:** While old material can be a starting point, content should always be modified and mapped to the specific audience and stakes of the current presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.
*   **Adapt to Culture:** Different organizational cultures may prefer varying slide densities. Some audiences, like executives or consulting clients, may expect dense slides; others prefer cinematic, visually light presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.
*   **Start with Thinking, Not Software:** Before opening presentation software, sketch ideas or storyboard the narrative. This helps ensure a clear message before focusing on visual execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.
*   **Utilize Common Frameworks:** For internal team meetings, using familiar dense slides, tables, or spreadsheets that everyone understands is acceptable if it helps align the team around a process or objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

## Crafting Presentations: The Process

Duarte's process for high-stakes presentations mirrors how Pixar makes movies:
1.  **Narrative Crafting:** Define the overall narrative, the "big idea," and draft the script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
2.  **Visualization and Chunking:** Visually map out and segment key moments and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
3.  **Model Development:** Begin working on key visual models or diagrams that will serve as central ideas, often circulating them early to build consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>.
4.  **Consensus Building:** Involve various departments or stakeholders to ensure alignment and refine the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.
5.  **Refinement:** Work out "kinks" in the narrative and visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.
6.  **Delivery:** The final voice track and visuals are supported by this extensive preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.

Duarte also stresses adapting the process to the specific situation. For a high-stakes meeting, like petitioning for a large budget, foregoing slides in favor of direct, passionate verbal communication, potentially supported by simple whiteboard drawings, can be more effective than relying on technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>.

A "minor" change that significantly impacted their execution was developing an **annotation system** for slide status on large Enterprise projects. This visual process allows 20-30 contributors to instantly know the status of each slide, streamlining editing cycles and version control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>.

## Overcoming Public Speaking Nerves

Nervousness in public speaking is often a fight-or-flight instinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. Often, thoughtful and contemplative speakers, who tend to be more nervous, also have the best content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

Strategies to manage nerves:
*   **[[visualization_techniques_for_public_speaking | Visualize]] Success:** Sit in the audience before a talk, look at the stage, and picture friendly, smiling faces. This helps change the mental model of a judging audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Control Your Environment:** Find a quiet, dark place backstage to focus on content and breathe, avoiding distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
*   **Chemical Shift:** Watch a short, funny video or recall something that makes you laugh right before going on stage. This can chemically shift your body from nervousness to laughter, helping to reset your mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.
*   **Breathing Exercises:** Practice specific breathing patterns to calm yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. (Note: Avoid extreme physical warm-ups if they interfere with composure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

## Virtual Presentations

Presenting remotely, especially on platforms like Zoom, introduces new challenges for [[improving_communication_skills | communication skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.
*   **Eye Contact with the Camera:** Consciously look at the camera (the "little dot") rather than faces on the screen to simulate direct eye contact with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
*   **Loss of Physical Cues:** Remote settings limit visibility of hand gestures, body language, and physical presence, which are common communication characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.
*   **Presence Coaching:** Requires specific coaching on how to project presence in a virtual environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Challenges:** In hybrid settings (some in-office, some remote), remote participants often struggle to be heard, as in-room attendees tend to dominate the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>.

## The Torchbearer Leader: Leading Movements

In her book *Illuminate*, co-authored with Patty Sanchez, Duarte introduces the concept of the "torchbearer leader." This idea originated from studying large movements and understanding that presentations are often part of a broader effort to move people towards an "alternate future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

A torchbearer leader knows the general direction, but like someone with a torch in a cave, only sees five to eight feet ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>. This limited visibility is enough to dissipate fear for those following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.

Movements, like stories, have a five-act structure:
1.  **Dream:** Leaders verbalize the vision of the new place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Leap:** People choose to commit to the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
3.  **Fight & Climb:** This is the "messy middle" where participants face challenges and overcome roadblocks, requiring perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.
4.  **Arrive:** The movement reaches its destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.

At each phase, leaders must use speeches, stories, ceremonies, and symbols to provide the "emotional fuel" necessary for people to keep going and see the idea realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>. This approach is particularly relevant for [[effective_strategies_for_alignment_and_communication_in_startups | leading change]], which has been a constant in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>.

## The Evolution of Content Quality

The expectation for video content production quality has significantly shifted. Informal, informative videos are often more successful than highly polished, cinematic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. People prioritize content and information delivery over elaborate editing and graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>.

## Storytelling in Product Management

[[storytelling_and_drawing_in_product_management | Storytelling]] can be applied throughout the product management process, from exploration to production and reveal:
*   **User Journeys:** Visualizing a customer's "day in the life" through illustrations can reveal critical insights and even necessitate a shift in product strategy, as exemplified by Airbnb's "Snow White" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. Airbnb used a storyboard artist to draw keyframes of host and guest journeys, which became the company's strategy, displayed in their office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>.
*   **Product Explanation and Passion:** After extensive work on a product, product managers must be able to convey its meaning, "why," and their passion behind design choices (e.g., why a shoe is red) to gain acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Product Reveals:** High-stakes product launches, like Apple's big reveals, are prime opportunities to tell compelling stories about innovations that have been hidden and are now being brought to light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.

To [[improving_communication_skills | become a better presenter]], choose a topic you are deeply passionate about and work on that talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. The experience of presenting from your soul will instill a "feeling" of passion that can then be applied to less exciting business presentations, allowing you to tap into that passion point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>.

The [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager (PM)]] role, while often perceived as glamorous, comes with significant [[challenges_in_product_management | challenges]] and realities that are less talked about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. Successful PMs embrace these difficulties, understanding that their true impact stems from navigating the complex and often unglamorous aspects of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## "That's Not My Job" Mentality

A key [[attributes_of_successful_product_managers | attribute of successful product managers]] is their willingness to take on tasks that might not technically be part of their defined role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. If a PM finds themselves saying "that's not my job," it's often a sign that it's precisely something they should do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While it might genuinely be someone else's responsibility, successful PMs overcome frustration and simply get the work done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This approach leads to faster progress, more successful products, and reduced personal [[challenges_product_leaders_face_busyness_and_frustration | frustration]] and negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Emotional Center of the Team

For better or worse, [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product managers]] frequently serve as the emotional center of their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Their role involves keeping team members motivated, excited, and bought into the project, requiring them to maintain optimism constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This emotional labor is demanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## "Carrying the Water" â€“ Doing the Unglamorous Work

A significant reality of the PM role is the necessity of "carrying the water," meaning performing hard, boring, and unglamorous work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This includes tasks such as:
*   Customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
*   Sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
*   Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
*   Writing copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
*   Project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>
*   Quality Assurance (QA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>
*   Implementing solutions with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

These tasks are crucial because the PM is ultimately responsible for the product's outcomes and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. If no one else will do it, it's the PM's job to ensure it gets done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Accountability and Making Bets

Unlike engineers who write code or designers who create solutions, a PM's job is not defined by a single artifact; it's about delivering business results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. This unique position means PMs are often the ones filling in all the gaps to ensure a problem is solved for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.

### The "Oh S***" Feeling of Making a Bet
PMs must be willing to "make a bet," understanding there's a chance the initiative might not work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. This willingness to take responsibility and accountability for picking the right things distinguishes the [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## The Time Investment for Mastery

Many aspiring PMs are frustrated by the slow pace of [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. However, it takes significant time to become truly proficient in [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. Maggie Crowley shares that it took her five years to feel confident in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. This is largely because gaining expertise requires shipping a lot of products, and seeing the long-term consequences of decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. Staying with a company or product for several years, rather than frequently job-hopping, can be invaluable for gaining this deep experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

> "The more you ship, the more you learn. And that's why it can take years to build up expertise because you just have to ship a lot of stuff." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>

The field of User Experience (UX) research is currently undergoing a significant shift, often described as a "reckoning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. While the discipline of user research from the last 15 years may be "dying," the core practice of research remains more crucial than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. This evolution is driven by the need for research to demonstrate clear business value and integrate more effectively into product development processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## The Challenge of User-Centered Performance

A common pitfall in UX research is "user-centered performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This refers to a practice of customer obsession or user-centeredness that is more symbolic than genuinely focused on learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's often work done to signal [[balancing_customer_focus_and_business_metrics | customer obsession]] without a real intent to change decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

Examples of user-centered performance include:
*   Product Managers (PMs) asking researchers to run a quick user study at the very end of a product process "just to validate assumptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This is too late to meaningfully influence decisions and is often just "checking the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Executive listening sessions or focus groups primarily intended for leaders to "get close to the customer," which are often 97% performance and not genuinely focused on learning or driving better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

Many designers and PMs are reluctant to be wrong and instead seek to validate their existing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. A more effective mindset for research is to "falsify" rather than "validate," actively seeking to be proven wrong to uncover true insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Types of Research: Macro, Middle-Range, and Micro

Research can be categorized into three types:
*   **Macro Research**
    *   Focus: Big picture, strategic, business-focused, forward-looking, and innovation-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   Activities: Understanding market and competitors, long-term product direction, involvement in strategic planning, and Total Addressable Market (TAM) studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This type of research often ties into annual planning processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.
*   **Micro Research**
    *   Focus: Technical usability, ensuring pixel-perfect execution, and analyzing AB test results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   Value: Drives significant business value rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. An example is identifying a "multi-million dollar button" fix from a usability issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. This type of research can deliver results in as little as 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. It should not be considered "scut work" or only for junior researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Middle-Range Research**
    *   Focus: "Middle altitude" user understanding questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, such as how users think, feel, behave, or use a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
    *   Problem: While interesting, this type of research is often not impactful enough for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. It can yield insights that are hard to operationalize and often leads to post-hoc bias where findings seem "obvious" after the fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. It can also delay decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Many companies, especially during periods of easy funding, over-hired researchers without properly integrating them or understanding how to drive impact, often relegating research to a "service function" that is reactive and called in too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This leads to a vicious cycle where research is less impactful, leading to sidelining or layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

## Strategies for a Business-Oriented Research Function

To ensure user research is business-oriented and impactful, several [[strategies_for_integrating_design_with_business_growth_objectives | strategies for integrating design with business growth objectives]] are crucial:

### For Researchers:
1.  **Develop Diverse Research Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>: The most effective researchers possess a "Swiss army knife" of skills, including:
    *   **Formative/Generative Research**: Looking ahead, innovation-focused, open-ended, ethnographic methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.
    *   **Evaluative Research**: Usability testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.
    *   **Rigorous Survey Design**: For scaled responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>.
    *   **Applied Statistics**: Essential for understanding AB test results and data-rich environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>.
    *   **Technical Skills**: Such as SQL for running queries or prompt engineering for generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.
2.  **Go Deep on Business Knowledge**: Researchers must understand business goals, metrics, conversion funnels, and competitive reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Reading quarterly reports and listening to shareholder calls can help researchers speak the language of product and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. This enables them to propose research questions that directly drive maximum business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
3.  **Build Strong Relationships**: Consistent engagement with product and design teams from beginning to end of the product development process is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Researchers become repositories of insights for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. The goal should be for teams to be unwilling to make decisions without the researcher present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.
4.  **Ruthless Prioritization**: Researchers often work on too many projects, leading to diluted impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. They need to learn to say "no" and focus on the most important things, often requiring support from their partners to prioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>.
5.  **Be Excellent Communicators**: Insights are only valuable if effectively communicated to the right audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>. Researchers should be able to break down complex problems simply and tailor their communication to various stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>.

### For Companies:
1.  **Integrate Research from the Beginning**: Avoid treating research as a reactive service function. Researchers should be involved from the start of a project to help frame the right questions for maximum business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
2.  **Unify Insights Functions**: Siloing different insights disciplines (UX research, market research, consumer insights, data science, customer service feedback) is counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. Companies should aim to create an integrated insights machine that consolidates and leverages all available data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
3.  **Match Researchers with Key Partners**: Instead of spreading researchers thinly, pair them with key product or design partners to foster consistent, engaged relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. This creates demand for more researchers as their impact becomes clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.

### For Product Managers and Designers:
1.  **Avoid Excessive Reliance on Intuition**: While intuition is valuable, it is prone to biases and blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. Engage "System 2" thinking (slow, methodical process) to check your gut feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.
2.  **Leverage the "Wisdom of the Crowd"**: Bring together people with diverse information sources and judgments to debate and expose different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.
3.  **Partner Closely with Researchers**: Create processes that fully [[importance_of_integrating_ux_research_in_product_development | integrate user researchers]] and insights from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
4.  **Beware of Common Tropes**:
    *   **"Research is too slow"**: Good research can be very fast, especially micro-level usability studies, and saves time by avoiding costly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
    *   **"I can do my own research"**: While engaging with customers is good, professional researchers have the expertise to avoid biases, ask the right questions, and synthesize insights that are not idiosyncratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
    *   **"AB test everything"**: AB tests show *what* happened but rarely *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Qualitative research provides the "how and why" to avoid future mistakes and build better products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
    *   **"If I'd asked my users..." (Henry Ford quote)**: This quote, while apocryphal, highlights a misconception about research. Researchers do not just ask customers what they want; they uncover unspoken needs and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
    *   **"We knew this already; that was obvious" (Post-hoc bias)**: This is a form of hindsight bias where outcomes seem intuitive after the fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. Research helps expose biases and expand horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.
5.  **Dogfooding with Caution**: While important for PMs to use their own product, they must be wary of relying solely on their intuition, as they are "nothing like the user" in many ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. Prioritizing identified issues requires external validation to avoid personal biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.

## Evaluating User Research Value

User research should aim to build a strong mental model of the domain and user, rather than simply telling product teams what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. Good research can sometimes offer direct solutions, but often it provides a framework based on evidence, allowing the team to collectively experiment towards a successful product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. This approach contributes to a stronger understanding of [[developing_user_empathy_and_gathering_insights_for_product_development | user empathy and gathering insights for product development]].

### NPS (Net Promoter Score) Critique
NPS is considered by many survey scientists to be a flawed metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. Its "likelihood to recommend" question is problematic due to its 0-10 scale, often unlabeled poles, and large number of items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>. Research shows a simpler Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) metric ("Overall, how satisfied are you with your experience?") has better data properties, is more precise, and is more correlated to business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>. NPS's reported benchmarks are also often inconsistent and not truly comparable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>.

By adopting a more business-oriented mindset, integrating research into product development from the outset, and focusing on diverse, impactful research methods, the UX research field can overcome its current [[challenges_in_ux_research_and_its_evolving_role | challenges in UX research and its evolving role]] and demonstrate significant value. This will enable better decision-making and foster a truly learning-focused product culture, rather than one of mere performance.

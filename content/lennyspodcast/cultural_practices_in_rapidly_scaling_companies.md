Jessica Lax, VP of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, discusses key [[Building and scaling a companys culture | cultural practices]] essential for scaling teams and achieving business impact, particularly within complex, rapidly growing organizations. DoorDash, which has built one of the largest and most impactful data teams in tech, serves as a prime example of these practices in action. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>

## Core Principles of Data Team Culture

Lax emphasizes two main principles for structuring a data team:

1.  **Analytics as a Business Impact Driver**: Analytics should operate as a business impact-driving function, not merely a service function. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> The goal is to provide a point of view on decisions, answering "what do we do now that we know this?" rather than just "why?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> The team should focus on finding opportunities and bringing insights to the table. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
2.  **Centralized Org Model**: A centralized data organization, or "Center of Excellence," is superior to embedded models where analytics teams sit within business units. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>

### Benefits of a Centralized Data Organization

*   **Consistent Talent Bar**: Ensures a consistent and high standard for technical and soft skills during hiring. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
*   **Growth Opportunities**: Provides more avenues for professional development and movement across different problem areas within the company, helping to [[innovating_within_large_companies | retain talent]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   **Methodology and Metric Consistency**: Prevents inconsistent data definitions and methodologies across different teams, promoting efficiency and shared understanding. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> This also helps in identifying and automating recurring problems, aiding in scalability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>
*   **Strong Team Culture and Brand**: Fosters a unique culture of learning and sharing, where team members feel a sense of camaraderie and pride (e.g., "The A-Team" at DoorDash). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>

Lax clarifies that a centralized model at DoorDash does **not** mean a siloed, service-oriented data team. Instead, the central analytics team is divided into pods that align perfectly with product, engineering, operations, and marketing structures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> These pods are effectively embedded, sharing the same goals as their partner teams, ensuring alignment and shared success. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>

## Fostering Proactivity and [[Leadership and Team Dynamics in HighGrowth Companies | Ownership]]

To ensure the data team is proactive and contributes to strategic direction, rather than just answering ad-hoc requests:

*   **Intentional Time for Exploration**: It's crucial to intentionally carve out time for exploratory work and deep dives, as it tends to be the first thing sacrificed when inbounds increase. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>
    *   **Hackathons**: DoorDash utilizes hackathons to dedicate days for the team to investigate interesting problems and uncover opportunities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a> For instance, a hackathon deep dive into the referral channel uncovered significant fraudulent behavior, leading to better fraud checks and caps on referrals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>
*   **Communicating Tradeoffs**: When faced with numerous requests, data professionals should communicate tradeoffs by aligning tasks with shared goals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a> By stating, "If you want me to do this extra new thing, then one of these other things is going to have to drop," it makes the implications clear to business partners. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>
*   **[[Creating an entrepreneurial culture within an organization | Extreme Ownership]]**: The early DoorDash culture, instilled by CEO Tony Xu, fostered a mindset of extreme ownership where employees were willing to "roll up their sleeves" and do whatever was necessary for success. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a> This included a sales guy helping hand out promo codes or the entire company jumping on customer support during a site outage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>
    *   **"WeDash" Program**: This [[impact_of_company_culture_on_product_development | cultural practice]] continues today with the "WeDash" program, where all employees, including data scientists, regularly go out to dash or do customer support to build empathy with users (consumers, Dashers, Merchants) and identify product issues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>
    *   **Beyond the "Box"**: Data scientists are expected to go beyond their defined roles to solve problems. For example, a data scientist might call customers to understand qualitative reasons behind unexpected experiment outcomes, rather than just relying on quantitative data. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a> This "product management work" or "engineering work" from a data science perspective is encouraged and has led to team members transitioning to other orgs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>

## Defining Effective Metrics

Lax highlights crucial lessons in [[using_operating_principles_to_guide_company_culture | defining metrics]] to align incentives and drive desired outcomes:

1.  **Short-Term Proxies for Long-Term Outputs**: Avoid goal-setting on long-term, hard-to-move metrics like retention directly. Instead, identify and measure short-term inputs that drive long-term outcomes, and then experiment to confirm the relationship. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>
2.  **Keep it Simple**: Complex composite metrics (e.g., a "Merchant Health Score" with weighted factors) are often difficult for teams to understand and influence, making them ineffective. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a> Simpler, more intuitive metrics, even if there are a few of them, are better for driving real outcomes because people understand what they're trying to move. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>
3.  **Common Currency for Tradeoffs**: Quantify the impact of different business levers (e.g., price changes, delivery times, new restaurant listings) in a common currency like Gross Order Value (GOV) or volume. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a> This allows for informed tradeoffs between different teams (e.g., marketing vs. logistics) and quicker, better strategic decisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>
4.  **Focus on Edge Cases and Fail States**: While averages are important, it's crucial to set goals around eliminating rare but catastrophic "fail states" (e.g., "never delivered" orders). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a> These experiences, though infrequent, lead to significant churn and high costs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>
    *   Sometimes, data might not show the full picture (e.g., login errors, where affected users aren't in the system), requiring deeper investigation beyond surface-level metrics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>

## [[Innovative hiring practices in startups | Hiring for Cultural Fit and Growth]]

Beyond technical skills, Lax looks for specific qualities:

*   **Curiosity and Self-Motivation**: The ability to "pull on threads" and proactively investigate anomalies without being told is invaluable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a> This can be tested through case studies with intentional "oddities" or by asking candidates to provide examples of self-initiated investigations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>
*   **Ambiguity Tolerance and Decisiveness**: Candidates are tested on their ability to break down problems, handle ambiguity, and make decisions even with imperfect information. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>
*   **Adaptability to Feedback**: Observing how candidates react to being told they are wrong is a key signal, as it reveals their ability to take new information and pivot their thinking. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>
*   **Non-Traditional Backgrounds**: Lax herself, with a background in finance and art rather than traditional data science, emphasizes the value of diverse backgrounds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a> DoorDash actively imports talent from other teams (Ops, Marketing, Finance), fostering a rich environment where different expertise can teach and learn from each other. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a> This diversity also extends to prior company size and stage, blending startup "hustle and grit" with big-company "scale" experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>

## Leveraging AI for Productivity

In line with [[Building a productfocused company culture | building a product-focused company culture]], DoorDash is exploring AI to enhance team productivity:

*   **"Ask Data AI"**: This internal chatbot, named after an old Slack channel, helps non-technical users edit queries and extract data independently. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a> This reduces the analytics team's burden on routine tasks, empowering more users and freeing up the data team's bandwidth for more complex, impact-driven work. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>

Overall, DoorDash's approach to [[building_a_companys_culture | company culture]] within its data organization emphasizes strategic impact, continuous learning, adaptability, and a relentless focus on solving problems for the business and its customers.

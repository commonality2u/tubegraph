Shreyas Doshi, known for sharing [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | wisdom on the art of product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>, advocates for the use of "premortems" as a critical practice for product teams. This approach proactively identifies potential issues before they cause problems, leading to greater [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] and better [[importance_of_execution_and_output_in_product_management | execution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## What is a Premortem?

A premortem is a proactive exercise, distinct from a traditional postmortem, which typically occurs after a launch or initiative has gone wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. The core idea is to gather the team early in a project's lifecycle to anticipate what could go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

The genius of the premortem lies in its initial prompt:
> "Imagine this project that we are working on has failed six months from now, or this launch we are doing has miserably failed. Let's just all imagine that. Now let's work backwards from there and ask ourselves, what went wrong? What could have contributed to this utter failure?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>

If a premortem is done correctly, it can prevent the need for an "ugly postmortem," though a postmortem might still be conducted for learning purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Shreyas Doshi learned about this concept from a Harvard Business Review article by Gary Klein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.

## Why Premortems Work

Premortems derive their effectiveness from several key factors:
*   **Psychological Safety** The hypothetical nature of the failure allows team members to openly discuss concerns they might otherwise hesitate to voice due to a desire to appear positive or optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. This creates a "great catharsis" for the team, making them feel lighter despite discussing potential failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.
*   **Shared Vocabulary** The process introduces a common language for identifying and discussing threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. This fosters an environment where team members feel comfortable bringing up potential issues in future meetings, even when the leader isn't present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

## How to Conduct a Premortem

Shreyas Doshi developed a template for running premortems, which includes specific steps and threat categories. This template is available as a Coda doc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>.

### Participants
*   **Include Every Function** It is crucial to involve people from every function that will be involved in the project or launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.
*   **Segment for Large Launches** For very large launches, it's beneficial to separate the premortem into two groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>:
    *   **Product Engineering Side**: Focuses on potential technical issues, including every engineer involved, a PM, and a design counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
    *   **Go-to-Market Side**: Involves sales, support, marketing, PR, and core engineering leads to discuss go-to-market risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. For smaller launches, one combined meeting suffices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.

### Meeting Structure
1.  **Introduce the Prompt**: The leader begins by stating the hypothetical failure scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.
2.  **Quiet Time**: Allocate 5-10 minutes for participants to individually list potential issues in a shared document, without seeing others' entries initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.
3.  **Share and Discuss**: Go around the room and have each person share their identified issues.
4.  **Identify Threat Types**:
    *   **Tiger**: A threat that "will actually kill us," representing genuinely harmful problems for the product or project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
    *   **Paper Tiger**: A seemingly intimidating threat that others might worry about, but you personally believe is not a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.
    *   **Elephant**: The "elephant in the room" â€“ an issue that nobody is openly discussing, which might not be fatal but indicates a lack of alignment with reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. For example, assuming user acquisition will happen with PR alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.
5.  **Voting**: After sharing, ask participants to select a "tiger" mentioned by someone *else* that they find most concerning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.
6.  **Action Plan**: The premortem leader is responsible for prioritizing the identified threats, creating a "post-premortem action plan," and ensuring accountability for progress on mitigating actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. The goal is not to solve *every* problem, but to address critical, unacknowledged threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.

## Impact and Benefits

Conducting premortems regularly has shown tangible benefits:
*   **Proactive Issue Identification**: Premortems allow teams to identify issues that would likely have led to problematic situations after a launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Public Backlash**: It helps companies foresee potential backlash from announcements, preventing the need for damage control or backtracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. Often, these issues *are* obvious to some team members, but without a premortem, there's no safe space or vocabulary to discuss them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: Premortems are an "inexpensive way" to uncover these issues, as they primarily involve one meeting followed by prioritization and mitigating actions that would likely be necessary anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>. This low-downside, high-upside approach is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

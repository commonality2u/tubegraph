Jason Fried, co-founder and CEO of 37signals, offers a contrasting perspective to the prevalent "go big or go home" philosophy often heard in the industry, which encourages raising substantial capital to achieve unicorn status [00:00:20]. Fried argues that this venture-backed path is rarely successful for most, with "almost nobody makes it that way" [00:00:31]. Instead, he advocates for a more sustainable approach focused on profitability and independence, rather than aggressive growth metrics [00:01:35].

## A Contrarian View on Business Growth

37signals, the company behind Basecamp and HEY, operates distinctly from typical tech companies. They have no investors, no board, no plans to go public, and no desire to sell their business [00:01:03]. They have maintained profitability for 24 consecutive years, generating "double-digit million dollar profits" annually, with over 100,000 customers [00:01:09]. This stands in stark contrast to many VC-backed companies that "never make a dollar of" profit [00:01:17].

### Bootstrapping vs. Venture Capital
Fried emphasizes that for many companies, especially software businesses, raising venture capital is often unnecessary and can even be detrimental [00:07:46]. While industries requiring significant capital expenditures (like manufacturing or restaurants) may need external funding, software development is inherently cheap to start, requiring little more than "a couple laptops and a couple people" [00:07:56]. He notes that Silicon Valley has managed to make "the most profitable style of business the least profitable" by encouraging excessive spending on customer acquisition and hiring too many people [00:08:08].

According to Fried, taking the venture route forces a company onto a path where the "only one outcome for Venture backed companies which is go huge" [00:09:26]. This eliminates the vast "room to make it and to build a successful business" within the space between a small profitable entity and a massive "unicorny" one [00:09:36].

### Focus on Profit, Not Revenue
37signals prioritizes profit above all other metrics, stating, "we just want to make more money than we spend" [00:06:32]. They do not track revenue, OKRs, KPIs, or specific growth targets for customer acquisition [00:16:47]. The ultimate measure of success for them is collective profitability at the end of the year [00:15:54]. Fried believes that focusing on profit forces entrepreneurs to practice "making money," a fundamental skill that many VC-backed companies never truly master because they are constantly "getting pumped full of money by somebody else" [01:18:01]. This lack of financial constraint can lead to "sloppiness" [01:16:55].

## The 37signals Model: Efficiency and Simplicity

### Small Teams and High Efficiency
37signals operates with a relatively small team of around 75 employees, especially when compared to competitors like Asana (1,600 employees), ClickUp (1,000), Slack (2,500), Smartsheet (3,000), and Monday (1,500) [00:10:06]. Despite this, 37signals maintains a similar customer base (over 100,000) and significant profits while their larger competitors often do not [00:10:22].

This efficiency stems from:
*   **No salespeople:** Their [[productled_growth_strategy | product]] sells itself through organic word-of-mouth [01:02:07].
*   **Simple product offerings:** They have "one codebase, one product" with a simple pricing structure (e.g., Basecamp caps at $299 for unlimited users) [01:11:38]. This avoids the complexity and high support costs of servicing diverse enterprise clients with multiple tiers and customizations [01:11:00].
*   **Intentional constraints:** Fried believes that "constraints Simplicity small teams actually are where it's at" for doing great work [01:12:00]. He suggests that a larger team would lead to a "worse off company" due to increased complexity and layers of management [01:13:17].

### Product Development: Appetite over Estimates (Shape Up)
37signals employs a unique product development methodology called "Shape Up" (documented at basecamp.com/shapeup) [00:33:39]. Key principles include:
*   **Six-week cycles:** Any feature chosen to be built cannot take longer than six weeks [00:34:01]. This is an "appetite" (a fixed budget of time) rather than an "estimate" (how long it's predicted to take), preventing projects from dragging on indefinitely [00:34:02].
*   **Two-person teams:** Each feature is built by one programmer and one designer [00:35:04]. This avoids large meetings, slow decision-making, and complexity [00:35:17].
*   **Shaping work ahead:** Ideas are "shaped" ahead of time, then the team is given "latitude to figure out how to get that thing done," without rigid to-dos or tickets [00:35:20].
*   **"Hill charts" and "trading concessions":** Progress is tracked on "hill charts" (distinguishing between "pushing up the hill" – figuring out – and "downhill" – execution) [00:36:32]. If a project hits its time limit while still "on the left side of the Hill," it "almost certainly dies" [00:37:02].
*   **Cool-down periods:** After each six-week cycle, there's a two-week "cool down" period where teams can "internally freelance," fix bugs, or work on pet projects [00:42:52]. This prevents burnout from continuous "sprints" and allows for replenishment [00:43:52].

This approach helps prevent "long running projects that never end," which are demoralizing for teams [00:37:11]. Fried warns against making "180 degree changes quickly" when adopting new methodologies, suggesting starting with "low criticality projects" to allow teams to learn and adapt without high stakes [00:40:41].

### Rejecting War Metaphors in Work
Fried finds the common use of war metaphors in business ("conquer the market," "target customers," "destroy the competition," "make a killing") "depressing" [01:09:57]. He believes that language shapes perspective, and such metaphors create a combative and destructive mindset [01:10:19]. Instead, 37signals focuses on words that are "more additive and alternative," emphasizing creation and pride in work, such as "let's make something great" [01:11:10].

## Success Defined by Enjoyment and Sustainability

### The "Stayup" Mentality
Fried introduces the concept of a "stayup" rather than a "startup" [02:00:20]. He finds the idea of starting a business "way easier than in business" [02:00:25]. Staying in business, enduring competition, managing employees, and navigating plateaus is the harder part [02:00:46]. For 37signals, success is about creating "the company that I want to work at" and continuing to do the work they enjoy for as long as possible [02:00:04]. This aligns with the idea of playing "infinite games" – focusing on activities with no defined end goal, like building relationships or a long-lasting company [01:00:01].

### Trusting Gut and Intuition
37signals makes decisions heavily based on "gut and instinct" rather than being "data driven" [00:43:58]. Fried believes that all human decisions are "judgment calls," influenced by thousands of known and unknown factors beyond mere numbers [00:44:37]. When hiring, he looks for designers and product people with "good gut instinct" and "taste," often asking "what would you do with this idea if you had another couple days?" to see their raw creative impulses [00:51:08]. He encourages team members to express "how does this feel" about products and flows, valuing this qualitative feedback over purely quantitative metrics [00:48:02].

## The "Once" Product Line: An Alternative to SaaS

37signals is launching a new product line called "Once," which challenges the prevailing SaaS model [01:23:32]. These will be non-SaaS "products not services" that users "download, pay for once, and then install on their own server" with no recurring subscription fees [01:24:36].

*   **Motivation:** Fried believes there's "subscription fatigue" and that many SaaS products are commodities that still charge "luxury prices" [01:25:50].
*   **Strategy:** They aim to create "beautifully tight simple essential generics of very high quality" that focus on the "80/20" of functionality [01:25:53].
*   **First product:** The first "Once" product will be a relaunch of "Campfire," their group chat tool originally released in 2006 [01:26:41]. This is positioned as an "alternative" to expensive chat tools like Slack or Teams, offering a simple, high-quality solution for a one-time fee [01:27:01].
*   **Key differentiators:** Users will receive updates (1.x versions for free, 2.0+ as discounted upgrades) [01:31:50]. Crucially, users will get access to the "code" of the product, allowing them to modify and tweak it [01:28:57]. This provides a unique level of control and transparency not available in most SaaS offerings. The target market is the "fortune five million," not large enterprises [01:32:57].

## Conclusion

Fried's advice for entrepreneurs aspiring to this path is to "stay as small as you can for as long as you can" [01:12:16]. Controlling costs and doing as much work as possible independently are crucial [01:13:10]. He encourages embracing the "scrappiness" that comes from constraints, contrasting it with the "slop" often encouraged by abundant capital [01:20:38].

He advises: "keep making great, keep your cost in check, charge appropriate prices for your work, share as much as you can, and let the chips fall where they may" [01:22:11]. Ultimately, the core philosophy is simple: "no one ever went broke making a profit" [01:23:03]. Growth, in this model, is a natural outcome of creating valuable products with pride and efficiency, rather than an aggressive pursuit driven by external financial targets or expectations [01:06:54].

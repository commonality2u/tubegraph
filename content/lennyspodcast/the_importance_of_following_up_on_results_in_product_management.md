Maggie Crowley, VP of Product at Toast, highlights that among the three most common threads she observes in the best product managers (PMs), "following up on results" stands out as crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This practice is vital for both demonstrating competence and fostering continuous learning within [[product_management_insights | product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.

## Why Follow Up on Results?

Many product managers set a metric they care about or even establish a dashboard for tracking, but the truly effective ones consistently follow up on the outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This seemingly simple act is remarkably rare and highly valued by leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

Key reasons for rigorously following up include:
*   **Manager Perception and Trust** Managers often do not remember to follow up on every feature or project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. A PM who proactively reports back on what happened after a project is completed earns significant trust and demonstrates reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This proactive sharing of progress ensures that one's efforts are noticed, rather than relying on chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. It creates an "aura" that the PM has control and won't drop the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
*   **Learning and Iteration** The act of following up forces PMs to go back and understand *why* something happened or didn't happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. The more a PM follows up and learns from their shipped products, the better they become with each subsequent release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. This continuous learning cycle is crucial for building expertise, as it can take years to truly gain confidence in product management due to the time it takes to ship and observe outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   **Driving Impact and Accountability** Ultimately, a PM is responsible for business outcomes and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Following up on results directly connects output to impact, helping to assess whether the "bet" made on a product was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This ensures that the efforts of the team translate into tangible value for the customer or user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. This is central to [[balancing_output_and_impact_in_product_management_roles | balancing output and impact]] in product management roles.

## How to Effectively Follow Up

While the concept is straightforward, implementing it effectively is key:
*   **Set Reminders** Simply putting reminders in your calendar to check dashboards or metrics at regular intervals (e.g., two weeks, a month, six months after launch) ensures follow-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
*   **Share Results Proactively** Once results are gathered, share them with relevant stakeholders who might care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. This proactive sharing builds trust and demonstrates accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

Maggie Crowley emphasizes that while core skills like communication and analytical ability are foundational, these three traits — simplifying, following up on results, and "carrying the water" (doing whatever it takes) — are what truly differentiate great PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This is particularly relevant when considering the [[challenges_and_insights_in_product_management | challenges and insights in product management]] that arise in execution. The ability to create a "good strategy" is only a small fraction of the work; the real measure of success comes from shipping more, getting more "reps," and ultimately creating [[balancing_output_and_impact_in_product_management_roles | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The continuous cycle of shipping and learning reinforces the [[importance_of_strategy_and_decision_making_in_product_management | importance of strategy and decision making]] combined with diligent follow-through.

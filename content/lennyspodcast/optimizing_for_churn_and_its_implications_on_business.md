Shopify, a significant player in e-commerce, approaches growth and business metrics in a way that often contradicts conventional wisdom, particularly concerning customer churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. With roughly 10% of U.S. e-commerce transactions happening on Shopify-powered stores, and processing about $235 billion in GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) globally in 2023, their scale provides a unique perspective on [[Developing a growth model for a business | business growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Shopify's Stance on Churn

Unlike most companies that prioritize increasing [[Strategies for finding and retaining satisfied customers | retention]] and reducing churn, Shopify's growth team effectively "optimizes for churn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This means they are not focused on preventing every merchant from leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### The Mission and Business Model
Shopify's core mission is to increase entrepreneurship on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. To achieve this, they aim to lower the barriers to getting started with an online business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. They acknowledge that most new businesses ultimately fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

Their business model supports this approach:
*   While they charge a subscription fee, most of their revenue comes from payments, which is directly tied to a merchant's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   In any given cohort of merchants, many may not succeed on their first attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. However, the few merchants who do become "extremely big businesses" generate enough GMV to make the entire cohort successful for Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This is analogous to [[Developing a growth model for a business | angel investing]], where a few successful investments offset many failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

This strategy means Shopify's [[Effective metrics for longterm business outcomes | net dollar retention]] for successful merchants is exceptionally high, making up for those who don't continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Measuring Long-Term Success
Instead of focusing on traditional retention rates, Shopify's growth teams measure success by the total GMV a cohort of merchants generates over several years (1, 2, 3, or even 5 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This "power law-based metric" means that a small number of very successful merchants drive the overall value of the cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### The Challenge of Short-Term Metrics
Focusing on long-term outcomes presents a challenge with short feedback loops. A positive short-term metric might not translate to long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Shopify addresses this through:
*   **Long-Term Holdouts:** They maintain holdout groups for every experiment, automatically reviewing their impact on the business one, two, and three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This helps refine short-term input metrics and ensures accountability to long-term GMV goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Counterintuitive Findings:** Roughly 30-40% of experiments that show a short-term lift (e.g., increased paying shops, first sale) actually have "no incremental lift on GMV" a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This often occurs because the initial lift is merely pulling forward success that would have happened anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
*   **Flipped Outcomes:** In some cases, an experiment might show no short-term lift but a significant positive impact on GMV long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. An example is pre-filled sections in the online store editor, which initially showed no conversion lift but later massively impacted sales, as it helped merchants create better, higher-converting stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

### Avoiding Local Optimization
A critical implication of this long-term, GMV-focused approach is the emphasis on **absolute numbers** over conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

*   **The Funnel Problem:** Teams often optimize for their specific part of the funnel, focusing on conversion rates (e.g., sign-up to activation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, it's often easier to "make it harder to do the thing right before your step" to artificially inflate your conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For example, making sign-up harder leads to a higher sign-up-to-activation rate because only high-intent users pass through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.
*   **Shopify's Solution:** By focusing on the total number of people who complete a journey stage (e.g., total activated merchants) rather than a conversion rate, teams are incentivized to reduce friction and get more people in the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. While this might hurt a local conversion rate, it brings in more potential high-value merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. This avoids "weird team incentives" that constrict the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

### Monetary Friction
A key lever for growth identified by Shopify is reducing "monetary friction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. This includes:
*   Trial dynamics (length, amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   Incentives like app store credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   The actual price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

Reducing monetary friction often leads to a higher volume of new users, even if there's a perceived "lower quality" initially due to discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. However, it can "causally change your ability to become successful" by giving them more time to experiment and grow their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This "unlocks a class of people" who might have given up without that initial monetary boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

## Collaboration with Sales and Hybrid Journeys
As Shopify has layered on a sales motion alongside its product-led growth, new challenges have emerged, particularly around attribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.

*   Historically, Shopify maintained distinct funnels: a sales funnel (driving MQLs) and a self-service funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.
*   The focus is now on creating "hybrid journeys" where merchants can seamlessly transition between self-service and sales assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.
*   This breaks traditional metrics. For example, if a user comes in via a self-service ad but then transitions to sales, their significant long-term value might not be attributed back to the initial ad campaign if LTV models are siloed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. This could lead to suboptimal investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.
*   Shopify is working to improve [[Effective metrics for longterm business outcomes | LTV modeling]], attribution, and [[Nonlinear dynamics in marketing and business | incrementality testing]] across these hybrid paths to ensure accurate value assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>. Incrementality, which measures causal impact, is seen as the "gold standard" over attribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>.

## Conclusion
Shopify's strategy challenges the conventional focus on minimizing churn by embracing a model that prioritizes lowering entry barriers and maximizing the potential for a few highly successful merchants. This is supported by a unique long-term vision, a payment-driven business model, a focus on absolute growth metrics, and continuous, multi-year experimentation.

At Netflix, the data and insights function plays a crucial role in the company's success and is structured in a unique way that sets it apart from many other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Elizabeth Stone, who was previously the Vice President of Data and Insights before becoming Chief Technology Officer, highlights the distinctiveness of this team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>.

## Unique Structure and Purpose
Unlike many large companies where data-oriented teams are often embedded within specific business lines (like ads or games) or organized by function (e.g., separating data engineers, data scientists, analytics engineers, and consumer researchers), Netflix has maintained a centralized data and insights team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>. This centralized team is both functionally diverse, encompassing all these roles, and works across nearly every area of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.

This structure, while challenging due to the need for extraordinary partnerships between data personnel and the teams relying on them, offers significant benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.

### Key Benefits
*   **Functional Expertise and Excellence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>: It allows Netflix to focus on being "world's best data engineers, world's best data scientists" and continually improve from a functional and technical perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>. This is relevant to the [[Role of Data Science in Online Marketplaces]].
*   **Career Paths and Mobility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>: People have better career paths due to increased mobility across teams within the centralized structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.
*   **Cross-Pollination of Ideas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:55:59]</a>: It enables more sharing of ideas across different problem areas and functional specializations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.
*   **Objectivity and Truth-Telling** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>: Perhaps the most critical benefit, the centralized team's job is not to simply affirm a desired narrative but to offer an objective perspective and act as "truth-tellers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. This fosters a culture of curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>, aligning with the [[Role of curiosity and ownership in data science]]. This approach helps the entire organization by providing honest insights, even if uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>.

The data and insights team must balance objectivity with being good partners, delivering on agreed priorities, and being flexible with their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. This gives them agency and responsibility to bring data to various spaces, such as partnering with engineering on data-related topics or collaborating with content teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

### Consumer Insights Team
The "insights" part of the team includes a consumer insights group that performs various types of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>. This includes:
*   **Internal Research** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>: For example, on tools and products used for studio productions, which is more user research-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>.
*   **Content Screenings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>: To ensure titles are the best version of themselves before appearing on the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.
*   **Traditional UX Research** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>: To improve title discovery experiences and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.
*   **Global and Regional Expertise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>: Understanding consumer needs and entertainment preferences across different regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>.

This integration of user research within the broader data organization is seen as a "superpower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>. It combines attitudinal research (qualitative and quantitative) with behavioral research (data science, data engineering, analytics) to tackle complex problems like optimizing recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>. This integrated approach enhances credibility and avoids potential conflicts or confusion between purely quantitative data and qualitative user insights, which is key for [[Leveraging User Insights for Product Development]] and the [[Importance of Customer and User Research]].

## Prerequisite: High Talent Density
The effectiveness of this structure, particularly the "freedom and responsibility" given to individuals, hinges on Netflix's [[Netflix culture of high talent density | high talent density]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>. The lack of excessive process and prescriptiveness is possible because Netflix has highly intelligent individuals with strong judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. This means data and insights professionals are expected to not just execute tasks but also to identify the right problems to solve and propose new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.

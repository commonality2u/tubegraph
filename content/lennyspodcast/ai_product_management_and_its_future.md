[[ai_in_product_management|AI product management]] involves a product manager (PM) who is responsible for integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into products or platforms to solve customer problems and drive business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:33">[06:33:33]</a>. The core role of a PM remains the same: bringing together design, engineering, business, and other teams to ship impactful solutions that represent the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:54">[06:35:54]</a>.

## Types of [[ai_in_product_management|AI Product Managers]]

Aman Khan, Director of Product at Arise AI, identifies three main "flavors" of [[ai_in_product_management|AI product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:19">[06:56:19]</a>:

1.  **AI Platform PMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:54">[07:01:54]</a>: These individuals build tools for [[ai_in_product_management|AI engineers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. An example is Arise AI, which provides observability and evaluation platforms for AI, including machine learning models and large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:48">[07:10:48]</a>. The tools in this space are still nascent, as building on LLMs has only been common for a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:23">[07:53:23]</a>.
2.  **AI Product PMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:18">[08:28:18]</a>: For these PMs, the core product itself is centered around AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:02">[08:34:02]</a>. Examples include ChatGPT or NotebookLM, where the essential user experience is enabled by the underlying AI model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:08">[08:40:08]</a>. Their role is to package cutting-edge technology from researchers and engineers to make it consumable for businesses, enterprises, or consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:26">[09:00:26]</a>.
3.  **AI-Powered PMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:51">[09:31:51]</a>: This type of PM is enabled by AI technology across the entire stack of their product management role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:04">[09:37:04]</a>. They may not build core models from the ground up but utilize LLMs or other models to create the best experience for their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:13">[09:52:13]</a>.

## Getting into [[ai_in_product_management|AI Product Management]]

It is now potentially easier to break into [[ai_in_product_management|AI product management]] than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. Previously, a deeper background in machine learning was often required to work at companies building AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. Now, with the rise of AI tools, the focus shifts to building experiences around or for other AI product individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:47">[23:11:47]</a>.

Key recommendations for aspiring [[ai_in_product_management|AI product managers]] include:

*   **Be Curious and Problem-Obsessed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:02">[17:48:02]</a>: Have a deep love for the problem you're trying to solve and a desire to push the boundaries of what's possible with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:07">[14:31:07]</a>. This curiosity should drive learning and tool adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:09">[17:50:09]</a>.
*   **Build a Foundation in AI/ML** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:37">[19:07:37]</a>: Understand the fundamentals of machine learning and AI, and what the technology is capable of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:04">[19:10:04]</a>. Resources like Andrej Karpathy's videos on the foundations of LLMs can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:07">[19:42:07]</a>.
*   **Develop a Portfolio** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:15">[20:49:15]</a>: Since there isn't a specific college degree for [[ai_in_product_management|AI product management]], building a portfolio of products or prototypes demonstrates interest and practical skills to hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:35">[20:25:35]</a>. It allows you to showcase how you think and your interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:07">[21:48:07]</a>.
*   **Utilize Modern Tools** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:05">[20:04:05]</a>: Leverage [[tools_and_techniques_for_ai_product_managers|AI tools]] to prototype and design ideas, even if they are not production-ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:15">[22:45:15]</a>.
    *   **Rapid Prototyping** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>: Tools like Cursor, Replit, and Vercel's V0 allow product managers to quickly build functional prototypes, even a working signup page on a phone in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:05">[11:06:05]</a>. These make it feasible for a PM to come to a meeting with mocks and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
    *   **Graphic Design** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:47">[12:04:47]</a>: AI tools like Midjourney or DALL-E can assist in graphic design, such as creating logos or visual user stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:41">[12:17:41]</a>.
    *   **Information Synthesis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>: Use tools like Gong and LLMs with long context windows to analyze meeting transcripts, identify common customer problems, and amplify signal from noise, effectively scaling yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>.

## Thriving as an [[ai_in_product_management|AI Product Manager]]

To be a top 5% [[ai_in_product_management|AI product manager]], one must go beyond simply replicating existing AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:14">[31:26:14]</a>.

*   **Focus on the Problem, Not Just the Technology** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>:
    *   A common pitfall after ChatGPT's launch was that many companies built "another ChatGPT" on their own data, often with limited usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:43">[30:52:43]</a>. The interface for AI might look very different from a chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:09">[32:03:09]</a>.
    *   The best PMs prioritize solving business problems and determining if AI is the right tool, rather than blindly implementing AI for AI's sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:33">[31:51:33]</a>.
    *   Similarly, avoid the trend of building [[ai_product_development_and_prototyping|AI agents]] just because it's a buzzword; instead, assess if it makes sense for your company or if leveraging foundational models' agentic layers in your existing product would be more beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:02">[33:17:02]</a>.
*   **The "Ikea Effect"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:03">[40:11:03]</a>: Successful AI products often leave some control to the user, similar to the Betty Crocker cake mix example where adding eggs made the product more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:03">[40:11:03]</a>. People feel more empowered when they have an impact on the end experience, rather than everything being fully automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:07:05">[41:07:05]</a>.
*   **Balance Innovation with Delivery ("Walk and Chew Gum")** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:21:49">[43:21:49]</a>: An [[ai_in_product_management|AI product manager]] must continuously deliver customer value and move business metrics while also creating space for prototyping, trying new tools firsthand, and holding hackathons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:32:04">[43:32:04]</a>. This experimentation might not directly impact KPIs, but it helps explore possibilities and learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:26:35">[44:26:35]</a>.
*   **Embrace Curiosity and Experimentation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:42:07">[44:42:07]</a>: The technology is changing rapidly, and not every experiment will succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:52:00">[44:52:00]</a>. The goal is to keep iterating and learning from failures, which helps AI and its deployment get better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:16:32">[45:16:32]</a>.
*   **Be a "Wanderer"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:59:44">[58:59:44]</a>: In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, it's often more effective for a PM to "wander" and actively seek out new directions and problems to solve, rather than "waiting" to see how things play out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:09:07">[59:09:07]</a>. This means being comfortable in an unknown, "squishy" space, pushing the boundaries of what the company believes is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

> [!TIP] Finding Good Ideas for [[ai_in_product_management|AI Integration]]
> *   **Measure "Shots on Goal"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:25:28">[37:25:28]</a>: Since AI prototypes might not immediately impact business metrics, measure the number of experiments or prototypes being built.
> *   **Hackathons** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:11">[37:32:11]</a>: Encourage hands-on experimentation across the organization to make the technology approachable and identify real problems where AI can stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:42:54">[37:42:54]</a>.
> *   **Obsess over User Experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:07">[39:31:07]</a>: Analyze successful [[ai_in_product_management|AI products]] to understand what makes them "magical" and identify principles for designing effective AI experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:52:13">[39:52:13]</a>.

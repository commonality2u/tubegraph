Melissa Perry, an expert in product management who has worked with thousands of Product Managers (PMs) and hundreds of companies, has observed numerous common problems within product organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Her insights stem from her consulting, interim CPO roles, and teaching at Harvard Business School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

## Root Causes of Organizational Issues

Many organizations mistakenly believe their primary issues lie in the training of their people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. However, 99% of the time, the problem actually resides in how goals are set and strategy is deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Trained individuals lack context without a clear direction, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to organizational transformations and setting up product organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Common [[challenges_in_product_management | Challenges in Product Management]]

Melissa Perry has witnessed a wide range of organizations, from software-focused companies to those just beginning to understand software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

### Scaling Challenges
For Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies that understand software's critical role, a major [[challenges_in_product_management | challenge]] emerges during the pivotal scale-up phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. This occurs when a company transitions from achieving [[challenges_of_achieving_productmarket_fit | product-market fit]] to scaling rapidly, often moving from a single product to a multi-product portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. At this stage, organizations must rethink their entire strategy, focus, and prioritize, as they are often managing a complex portfolio for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### Strategic Misalignment
A significant and recurring issue across product organizations, particularly in modern tech companies, is the lack of a clear, comprehensive, and prioritized strategy, or the inability to effectively deploy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

*   **Signs of No Strategy**:
    *   Teams are overworked ("working like dogs") but metrics aren't moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
    *   Product and tech functions are perceived as a "black box" by the executive team, who don't understand how their efforts contribute to company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
    *   Executives and the board are unaware of the product team's activities or progress towards goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
    *   Product teams don't understand *why* they are building certain features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
    *   Different departments or executives have conflicting goals, leading to internal infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
    *   A perceived "vision" may just be a tagline with no actionable meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
    *   Strategy often exists only in people's heads and is not clearly written down or communicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
    *   Teams are spread too thin across numerous initiatives, preventing significant progress on key metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Leadership Gaps in the [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Role of Product Managers in Organizations]]
One of the biggest issues is hiring a great Chief Product Officer (CPO) who can define the next phase of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

*   **When to Hire a CPO**:
    *   When the company needs a comprehensive product strategy that encompasses all aspects of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
    *   Poor communication between product and the executive team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
    *   Executives and the board don't know what the product or tech teams are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
    *   Individual product teams lack connection to the overall company strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
    *   Product managers are frustrated due to a lack of clear direction or leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
    *   Difficulty hiring product managers, indicating a need for a leader from whom they can learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
    *   A high number of junior PMs without a clear training path or standardized process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
    *   The company is expanding into multi-product strategies, new geographies, or undergoing major transformations/mergers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
    *   When annual recurring revenue (ARR) is around $20-$30 million in a high-growth company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
    *   When the scope requires a single leader to bring product, design, product operations, analytics, and sometimes engineering together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### Operational Inefficiencies at Scale
[[product_management_in_large_tech_companies | Product management in large tech companies]] and scaling organizations faces specific operational [[challenges_and_realities_of_working_as_a_product_manager | challenges and realities of working as a product manager]] beyond individual PM skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

*   **Lack of Standardization**: Different roadmaps across teams make it impossible to aggregate or compare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   **No Career Ladders**: Lack of clear progression paths for product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Inefficient Meetings**: Too many types of meetings with the wrong people attending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Data Access Issues**: Product managers struggle to get the necessary data for informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Disorganized Customer Research**: Repeatedly contacting the same customers, causing frustration, and inability to easily search or revisit past interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Organizational [[challenges_in_product_management | Challenges]]

### Strategic Clarity and Communication
To address a missing strategy, it's crucial to document and communicate it clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

*   **Two-Pager Strategy**: CEOs should write a two-page document outlining the company's origin, current state, external threats, competition, what the company *will* and *will not* do, and prioritize strategic intents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Tiered Strategy Documents**:
    *   **Executive Level**: Strategic intents (big business movers for 2-3 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Product Leadership (Director/VP/CPO)**: Problem-oriented product initiatives (meaty problems for customers, made of multiple epics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Product Teams**: Solutions (what features/options to build) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **Vision**: A good vision is concrete enough to be pictured, lofty, different from the current state, and specifies what the company will *not* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Using visuals and diagrams alongside writing can make a vision more powerful and clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

### Data-Driven Decision Making
Leaders often struggle with strategy due to a lack of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Hiring data analysts or consultants skilled in data crunching can help surface insights from internal data (financials, user analytics) and external sources (customer research, market research) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This data provides the inputs needed to inform strategy, monitor progress, and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

### Action and Adaptability
Companies must be ready to take action and embrace drastic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Good leaders make the best-informed decisions possible at the time, but are also willing to correct course if data suggests it's the wrong path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

### The [[transforming_to_a_product_operating_model | Role of Product Operations]]
Product operations is an emerging role designed to help product management scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. It focuses on:
*   **Internal Data & Insights**: Helping surface data from financial systems and user analytics to track strategy progress and OKRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   **Customer & User Insights**: Standardizing external data collection, market research, and customer interviews to streamline the process and avoid bothering the same customers repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Process Standardization**: Defining cadences for strategy check-ins, roadmap reviews, and quarterly planning sessions, as well as standardizing processes that interact with other divisions like sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. This ensures efficiency without dictating internal team-level processes like stand-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

## Advice for Product Managers

To improve at strategy and avoid burnout from too much information:
*   **Focus on Execution**: Prioritize doing your job and then analyze what's working and what's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Deep Dive into Skill Gaps**: Identify specific areas for improvement (e.g., user research, data analytics) and focus learning efforts there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   **Practice Strategic Thinking**: Even if not in a leadership role, imagine what you would do as a CPO. Ask questions, dig into data, and gain "reps" in strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Talk to Others**: Engage with people who understand the market, financials, and other departments (e.g., sales, subject matter experts) to gain broader context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Adapt Frameworks**: Understand that basic product frameworks generally remain consistent, but adapt specific processes (like Agile) if they don't serve your team or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Retrospective**: Regularly assess if current practices are helping you improve as a product manager, and be willing to change your approach if not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

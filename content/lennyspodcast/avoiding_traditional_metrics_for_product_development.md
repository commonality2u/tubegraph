Shopify adopts a distinctive approach to product development, particularly within its core product teams, by largely [[importance_of_product_metrics_and_how_to_choose_them | avoiding traditional metrics and KPIs]] as primary drivers for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. This contrasts sharply with many companies that rely on a unified North Star metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>.

## Shopify's Unique Approach to Product Development

Archie Abrams, VP of Product and Head of Growth at Shopify, highlights that the company intentionally sets up different parts of the organization to think on varying time horizons and with distinct approaches to building product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>.

The three major product groups at Shopify are:
*   **Core Product:** Focused on a "hundred-year vision," building fundamental elements for commerce far into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>.
*   **Merchant Services:** Builds tools like payments and shipping, operating on a shorter to medium-term horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.
*   **Growth:** Concentrates on the end-to-end customer journey, focusing on bringing in and ensuring merchant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

For core product teams, [[importance_of_product_metrics_and_how_to_choose_them | metrics or KPIs are essentially banned]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. Instead, decisions are primarily made based on "taste and intuition" and building towards this long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>.

## The 100-Year Vision and "Taste"

Shopify's CEO, Toby, drives a "hundred-year vision" for the company, ensuring decisions are oriented toward the long-term success of merchants and Shopify itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:24">[01:23:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19">[01:42:19]</a>. This means:
*   **Prioritizing fundamental building blocks:** The focus is on creating the right technical foundation to build the future of commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:52">[01:48:52]</a>.
*   **Technical architecture dictates strategy:** Toby emphasizes that the "how" (technical architecture) is more critical than the "what" or "who" in a technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>. This often means taking longer to ship features to ensure a adaptable and flexible platform for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:38">[01:45:38]</a>. An example is the detailed discussion on building CSV importers using open-source libraries vs. internal development to ensure long-term optionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.
*   **Avoiding short-term incentives:** The company resists chasing immediate revenue opportunities (e.g., focusing solely on large enterprise businesses) if they don't align with the long-term goal of fostering entrepreneurship for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:01">[01:43:01]</a>.

Accountability in core product is maintained through:
*   **Conviction-based decision making:** Teams operate based on the conviction that a feature is the right technical foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:49">[01:48:49]</a>.
*   **Diverse inputs:** While data is considered, decisions are not overwritten by it. Qualitative insights and a strong "product sense" or "taste" are equally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:19">[01:49:19]</a>.
*   **Centralized review:** Every six weeks, R&D group leads, including Toby, review every single project across the company to ensure consistent quality and alignment with the long-term vision and technical principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>. All shipped projects require a "OK2 approval" from the relevant group lead (e.g., Glenn for Core Product), based on a short video review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a>.

## Focus on Absolute Numbers, Not Rates

A key principle, especially for the Growth team, is to optimize for the **absolute number of people** who achieve a certain outcome, rather than optimizing for conversion *rates* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "funnel constriction":** When teams are incentivized by local conversion rates (e.g., sign-up to activation rate), they are often implicitly driven to make the preceding step harder, thereby increasing their rate but reducing the total number of people in the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Total value focus:** Shopify's growth team measures success by the total GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) produced by a cohort of merchants over multiple years, rather than per-merchant metrics or short-term retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>. This [[effective_metrics_and_goal_setting_for_data_teams | power-law based metric]] means that a few highly successful merchants can make an entire cohort profitable, even if many others churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Lowering barriers:** This approach encourages lowering barriers to entry (e.g., reducing "monetary friction" like trial length or upfront costs) to get more people in the door, even if it might initially hurt conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

## Experimentation and Long-Term Impact

Shopify runs long-term holdout experiments, continuously monitoring the impact of changes for a year, two years, or even three years after initial deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **Automated follow-ups:** Experimentation tools automatically provide updated results at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, holding teams accountable for long-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:55">[02:21:55]</a>.
*   **Surprising outcomes:** Approximately 30-40% of experiments that show a short-term lift (e.g., increased paying shops or first sales) show no incremental long-term lift in GMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>. This is often due to pulling forward success that would have occurred anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Improved payment failure notifications showed short-term lift but no long-term GMV increase, suggesting those users weren't dedicated entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:16">[01:38:16]</a>.
*   **Neutral experiments can be positive:** Conversely, some experiments that show neutral or no short-term lift can have massive positive long-term impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Pre-configured sections in the online store editor showed no short-term conversion lift but significantly increased sales and GMV six months later, as it helped merchants create better-converting stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:20">[01:51:20]</a>. This encourages shipping "neutral" experiments if the intuition is strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.
*   **Empowering teams:** This long-term perspective allows teams to learn and refine their understanding of truly impactful input metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>.

## Challenges and Requirements for Success

This approach to product development, particularly the avoidance of traditional metrics for core teams, has specific requirements and challenges:
*   **Strong, opinionated leadership:** It necessitates a founder (like Toby) or a set of leaders with extremely strong opinions on "what good looks like" and a refined "taste" for product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>.
*   **Subjectivity:** Conversations about product direction can become highly subjective, requiring good discussion, openness, and debate among leaders and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:42">[01:49:42]</a>.
*   **Consistent quality bar:** A central "eye" on quality, held by a small number of key individuals (e.g., Toby, Glenn), is crucial to maintain a consistent bar for taste and prevent teams from building "whatever they want" in a haphazard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
*   **Trust and collaboration:** Healthy tension exists between core product (focused on taste/long-term vision) and growth (focused on driving numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:49">[01:54:49]</a>. This is navigated through trust, human relationships, and a commitment to shipping high-quality, polished products even when moving fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:11">[01:56:11]</a>.

Ultimately, for most companies, if they don't have a founder with exceptional taste and intuition, relying on [[measuring_developer_productivity | metrics for accountability]] and focus will lead to more successful product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

## Organizational Structure and Collaboration

Shopify's Growth organization comprises:
*   **Growth R&D:** Includes product, design, engineering, data, and traditional product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. It has three pillars:
    *   **Growth Products:** Covers the full merchant lifecycle from landing pages, sign-up, onboarding, monetization, to home feed engagement and merchant retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:26">[02:02:26]</a>.
    *   **Enablement:** Builds internal tools like experimentation platforms, communication platforms, and business intelligence tooling for growth and other Shopify teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
    *   **Customer Support Group:** Sits within growth, focusing on tooling and self-serve experiences to support the merchant journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Marketing:** Handles paid acquisition, media buying, affiliate marketing, email, content, and SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

Collaboration between core product and growth is critical despite their differing operational models. The Growth team ensures their high-quality work complements the core product's vision, even if their experimentation is faster-paced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:49">[01:54:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:01">[01:55:01]</a>. They prioritize getting more people successfully through each stage of the funnel (absolute numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

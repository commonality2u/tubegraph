From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Nikita Bier is a product visionary and founder known for successfully launching multiple apps to the top of the App Store, including TBH and Gas, which were acquired by Facebook and Discord, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:36">[02:04:36]</a>. He has a unique, experience-rooted philosophy on building and growing successful consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>.

## Early Ventures & Lessons Learned

### Potify and the Shift to Consumer Apps
Bier's first product was "Potify," a web app built in college to help American voters understand the financial impact of presidential policy proposals on their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:03">[06:36:03]</a>. It allowed users to input personal information like age and number of kids to see the monetary effect of tax proposals and government benefits, also simulating impacts on specific zip codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:46">[07:14:46]</a>. Potify went "super viral," gaining about four million users during an election season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:56">[07:39:56]</a>. This project evolved into a company called Outline, which secured government contracts, including one with the Obama Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:14">[08:04:14]</a>.

However, a government shutdown and contract cancellation led Bier to realize he disliked selling software to governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:04">[08:42:04]</a>. He pivoted to building consumer apps, believing his core competency was making things go viral online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:34">[08:58:34]</a>.

### The "Startup Studio" Model (Midnight Labs)
After returning initial investment money, Bier spent four to five years building a variety of consumer apps through a "startup studio" model, which he later revealed was called Midnight Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:31">[09:25:31]</a>. During this period, he launched approximately 15 apps, including mapping apps, chat apps, event meetup apps, and to-do lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.

One notable success was "Five Labs," an app that analyzed Facebook posts to determine personality based on language, using the same model as Cambridge Analytica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:14">[09:46:14]</a>. This app went viral in three days, accumulating tens of millions of profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:10">[10:00:10]</a>. This success led to further funding and a stronger focus on mobile development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:07">[10:09:07]</a>.

### Why Focus on Teens?
Through extensive experimentation, Bier and his team focused on building for teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:12">[10:45:12]</a>. He identified several key reasons:
*   **Malleable Habits:** Younger users' habits are less fixed, making them more open to adopting new communication products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   **Higher Invitation Rates:** Adults are less likely to invite others to new apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:28">[11:13:28]</a>. The number of invitations sent per user drops by 20% for every additional year of age from 13 to 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:04">[11:58:04]</a>.
*   **Daily Interaction:** Teens often see each other daily (e.g., in school), which is critical for spontaneous interaction and network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:16">[11:28:16]</a>.
*   **Urgency to Connect:** The number of people an individual texts peaks around age 21, then collapses, indicating a higher urgency to form connections during teen years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Build for Teens for Organic Growth
> If you build for adults, expect to acquire every user with ads, which requires substantial venture capital funding and is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:06">[12:27:06]</a>. Building for older cohorts makes it "basically impossible to grow that user base, especially to get density if you need actual network effects among users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:20">[12:41:20]</a>.

## TBH: Breakout Success

### The Idea: Latent Demand and Positive Anonymous Feedback
The concept for TBH (To Be Honest) originated from a high school senior who described a Snapchat trend where kids posted emojis and asked for positive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>. This indicated a "latent demand" for a "vehicle for disclosure" where teens could receive affirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:17">[25:46:17]</a>.

This insight combined with the observation that Saraha, an anonymous messaging app entirely in Arabic, was the number one app in the U.S., signaling a strong desire for anonymous communication despite poor user experience and negative messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:52">[26:03:52]</a>.

> [!info] [[strategies_for_achieving_productmarket_fit | Latent Demand]] for Product Ideas
> Look for situations where people are trying to obtain a particular value but are going through a "very distortive process" to get it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:01">[26:43:01]</a>. If you can crystallize their motivation and build a product that directly addresses it, you can achieve "intense adoption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:16">[26:52:16]</a>.

TBH innovated by allowing only positive anonymous feedback through pre-authored polls (e.g., "who has the best smile," "who's most likely to be president") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:37">[27:37:37]</a>. This approach made users feel better, eliminated bullying, and led to an "explosive adoption" with one school sending 450,000 messages in the first seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:00">[28:20:00]</a>.

### Viral Growth and Scaling Challenges
TBH immediately took off after being seeded in a Georgia school, spreading to 40% of the school in 24 hours and quickly to neighboring schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>. Bier predicted it would be the number one app in the U.S. in six days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:05">[21:48:05]</a>. At its peak, TBH was gaining 360,000 installs per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:10">[24:43:10]</a>.

The rapid growth caused servers to crash, leading to a controversial decision to "geofence" the app and roll it out state-by-state, giving the team time to scale servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>.

> [!tip] What Product-Market Fit Looks Like
> "If your product's working, you'll know. If there's any uncertainty, it's not working. And it really is a binary when it comes to consumer products. People are going to be fighting to get into it and you'll find new measures that you've never heard of, like our metric was hourly actives per day, not daily active users, hourly active users. So you'll you'll you'll start seeing that and it'll be abundantly obvious what product-market fit is, you'll know when you see it is the bottom line." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:55:00">[35:55:00]</a>

The initial growth strategy involved saturating a specific area with marketing messages, including targeted ads and Instagram follow-backs to students who identified their school in their bios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>. This method was used for testing and to achieve initial "intensity of adoption and density" for the network flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:00">[30:57:00]</a>.

> [!tip] User Research and Feedback
> Implement 24/7 live chat customer support in your app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>. This provides a "white glove experience," eliminates confounding variables about user problems, and is the best way to get direct feedback and conduct user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>.

### Sale to Facebook
Nine weeks after launch, TBH was sold to Facebook for over $30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The acquisition process was draining, with Facebook assigning 80 people to the deal compared to Bier's team of four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:00">[37:26:00]</a>.

## Reflections on Product Management at Facebook

### The Product Manager Role: A Skeptical View
Nikita Bier, despite being titled a "product manager" at Facebook, "doesn't believe product management is real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. He found that in large tech companies, product managers are "very little product management that you do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Instead, they primarily write documents, act as "team secretaries," and gather approvals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

> [!note] [[indepth_product_management_at_airbnb | Product Management]] and Design
> "Products live and die in the pixels. You should be designing the hierarchy, the pixels, the flows, everything â€“ that's on you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>
> Bier believes that product managers in large companies are often detached from the design process, which he considers his core strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:55:00">[39:55:00]</a>. He credits companies like Snapchat and Apple for letting designers "run the show," leading to novel products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:00">[49:52:00]</a>. For "zero to one" standalone app initiatives, he argues that the product manager *should* be designing the hierarchy, pixels, and flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:11:00">[51:11:00]</a>.

### Challenges for Large Companies in Innovation
Bier points out that large companies like Facebook struggle to launch entirely new products (`zero to one` initiatives) due to:
*   **Risk Aversion:** It's difficult to present ideas based on hunches without existing market signals because employees are focused on performance reviews and bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:11:00">[46:11:00]</a>. It's safer to copy existing successful products than to propose novel, unproven concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:22:00">[47:22:00]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Verbalizing Deep Motivations:** Explaining the nuanced, often emotional, reasons why people adopt apps (e.g., to find a mate, unplug from reality) can be challenging in a formal, "academic environment" of seasoned professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:39:00">[42:39:00]</a>.
*   **Slow Response to Market Signals:** Large companies can take 12 to 24 months to respond to competitive threats, allowing startups ample time to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>.

## Gas: Reinventing the Viral Loop

After four years at Facebook, Bier left and began to consider building another app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:58:00">[53:58:00]</a>. He was motivated by the question of whether TBH could have made more money if it had been monetized, as "Can I pay to reveal who sent me polls?" was the number one support message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:26:00">[56:26:00]</a>.

### Rebuilding for a New Era
Bier, with a new team, rebuilt the polling app concept under the name "Gas." The core idea was similar to TBH, but the underlying growth mechanisms had to be completely reinvented due to changes in the regulatory environment for sending text messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:07:00">[59:07:00]</a>. Unlike TBH, where invites were sent via Twilio, Gas required users to manually open a compose window and send each invite, significantly impacting the invite rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:20:00">[58:20:00]</a>.

The development was a "zero to one development cycle," as they had to figure out how to achieve virality again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:38:00">[59:38:00]</a>. The team tested multiple iterations, including renaming the app multiple times (e.g., "Crush," "Melt") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>. They discovered that the name and icon influenced invitation rates: "Crush" with a pink icon saw significantly lower invites from boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. Changing to "Gas" with a black flame icon increased invite rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

Gas was a "blowout success," growing larger than TBH, generating $10 million in sales, and accumulating 10 million downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. The team operated on "startup credits," resulting in almost pure cash flow without outside investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Ultimately, Gas was sold to Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>.

### Combating the Human Trafficking Hoax
During Gas's rapid growth, a hoax spread, falsely claiming the app was used for human trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>. This hoax, which plagues many viral apps, gained traction because creating such content offered teenagers attention and followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>.

Bier and his team fought the hoax relentlessly:
*   **Media Engagement:** They insisted that the *Washington Post* headline be "Gas App is Not for Human Trafficking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>.
*   **Direct Outreach:** They called school superintendents and police chiefs to retract public statements spreading the hoax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>.
*   **App Store Intervention:** They asked Apple to remove review-bombed negative reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.
*   **In-App Education:** Bier's girlfriend created a TikTok video explaining the hoax, which was shown to users attempting to delete their accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. This reduced daily account deletions from 3% to 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>.

> [!important] Ethical Growth
> Bier emphasizes the importance of operating "by the book" and "above board" with growth systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. He believes that if companies use user data unethically (e.g., inviting people on their behalf without explicit consent), "the internet... will come back and get even and defend itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

## Key Insights and Tactics for Building Consumer Apps

Bier's approach is rooted in practical experience and constant iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:17">[02:44:17]</a>.

> [!summary] Summary of [[insights_and_tactics_for_successful_consumer_apps | Insights and Tactics for Successful Consumer Apps]]:
> *   **Focus on Latent Demand:** Identify where people are already trying to achieve a value, even if through a "distortive process," and build a streamlined solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:01">[26:43:01]</a>.
> *   **Target the Right Audience:** Teens have malleable habits, high invitation rates, and frequent daily interactions, making them ideal for viral social apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
> *   **[[leveraging_first_principles_thinking_in_product_management | Relentless Focus on Core Value]]**: For TBH/Gas, it was about making teens feel good and receive positive affirmations, even designing systems to ensure everyone got votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.
> *   **Prioritization during Scale:** When an app goes viral, "everything breaks" and needs constant substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Ruthlessly prioritize and address the "largest fires first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a>.
> *   **Holistic Approach:** Marketing and product growth mechanisms are inseparable and must be aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:16">[01:33:16]</a>. From ads to in-app experience to invites, everything needs to be cohesive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>.

### Testing and Reproducible Processes
Bier emphasizes developing a "reproducible testing process" to maximize the chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Because consumer product ideas are unpredictable, focusing on process and taking "many shots at bat" reduces risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.

> [!tip] Test the Ideal Scenario
> When testing, try to achieve the "best possible version" of what the product could be, even if it requires manual work or non-scalable methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>. The goal is to eliminate "confounding variables" to get clear signal on whether the core product truly works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

For zero-to-one product development, focus on validating one thing at a time at 100% execution, while "half-assing the rest" to ensure clear signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. This includes layers of conditional statements (e.g., will people use the core flow, will it spread within their peer group, will it hop peer groups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### Optimizing "Time to Value"
In 2024, attention spans are extremely short, around three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>. If a product cannot demonstrate value within the first three seconds, users will likely churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>.

> [!tip] "Inverting the Time to Value"
> Craft the onboarding and initial experience to ensure the user reaches the "aha moment" in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. For example, with Dupe, the key was allowing users to simply type `dp.com` in front of any URL to find cheaper versions of products, an "iconic" and memorable trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>.

This requires "extraordinarily creative" use of available tools and APIs in non-traditional ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:23">[01:30:23]</a>. For instance, relying on users to exchange usernames is unrealistic; instead, design mechanisms that facilitate one-tap value exposure, like quick friend finding via contact sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>.

### The Impact of iOS Contact Permissions
iOS 18's changes to contact permissions will make it significantly harder to find and invite friends on apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>. The new flow, which requires users to individually select contacts from an alphabetical list after granting initial permission, is "egregiously bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>.

> [!warning] Future of Social Graphs
> Bier expects it to be "very difficult to find friends on apps going forward" and believes most new apps "will not have social graphs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:24">[01:26:24]</a>. This change will likely further entrench incumbents like Facebook and Snapchat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:28">[01:26:28]</a>. Founders relying on contact sync for growth need a "Plan B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>.

## Nikita Bier's Current Approach and Advising

Today, Nikita Bier advises around 35-36 companies, primarily consumer mobile companies, ranging from product concept stage to venture-backed billion-dollar businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a>. He works with companies through intro.co, aiming to return 10x their investment in the first 30 days by getting "table stakes growth things out of the way" and identifying "two to three step-function changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:47">[01:34:47]</a>. He actively engages in the design process, going into Figma with teams to refine pixels and flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>.

Bier has accumulated "growth hacks that still nobody knows about" over his years of building apps, which he shares with relevant companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. He has advised companies like Dupe and Saturn, helping the latter rebuild their FriendFinder, leading to it becoming a top productivity app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:14">[01:36:14]</a>.

While he appreciates the quality of life and financial gains from building and selling quick viral hits, he hasn't ruled out building a "venture-scale business" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. However, he would only do so under "very specific set of operating principles" to keep teams lean and maintain hands-on involvement in product development, unlike traditional large tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.

You can follow Nikita Bier on Twitter to "enjoy his shitposts" and stay tuned for his next viral hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:41">[01:37:41]</a>.

In a product-led sales environment, the internal configuration of collaboration differs significantly from traditional sales models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This shift mandates a deeper and more integrated relationship between product and sales teams.

## Traditional vs. Product-Led Sales Collaboration

Traditionally, the go-to-market structure often separates functions:
*   Marketing generates pipelines for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Sales sells the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   Product engages with paid users to drive retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   Product merely "throws features across the fence" for sales to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

In [[The Role of Product in Sales | product-led sales]], this relationship fundamentally changes:
*   Product is responsible for acquiring and activating customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Product actively creates the pipeline for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   The primary collaboration point is directly between product and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Product Accountability in Product-Led Sales

A critical aspect of successful [[The Role of Product in Sales | product-led sales]] is that the product team must take accountability for the sales pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> and the selling of the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Trying to implement [[The Role of Product in Sales | product-led sales]] solely through marketing efforts is a "recipe for disaster" leading to failure within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

In B2B, there has been a tendency to alleviate product management from monetization ownership, where product teams build and "throw it over the fence" for marketing and sales to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. When a sales-led growth company transitions to [[transition_from_productled_growth_to_productled_sales | product-assisted tactics]] or [[product_led_growth | product-led growth]], the biggest challenge is educating the product team on how the product can sell itself, focusing on monetization awareness, conversion friction, and clear value metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

Product teams must overcome their discomfort with owning monetization targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. While individual product managers may not directly own revenue targets, product leadership should be accountable for revenue, and product teams should be responsible for key performance indicators (KPIs) like free-to-paid conversion rates, package mix, [[Impact in product management | product qualified accounts (PQA)]], and [[Impact in product management | product qualified leads (PQLs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

## Key Collaboration Areas and Best Practices

To foster effective [[Engineering and Product Management Collaboration | collaboration]], consider the following:

### 1. Data and Qualification

*   **PQA Ownership**: Product teams should own the [[Impact in product management | PQA]] target, defining and iterating on what constitutes a qualified account for sales engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>. This requires continuous partnership with the analytics team to identify correlative signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.
*   **Early Sales Involvement**: Involve sales early in defining what signals excite them and what differentiates hand-raisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.
*   **Feedback Loops**: Establish strong feedback cycles with sales to ensure PQA definitions are continuously evolving and remain relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-Sending**: Do not send every single user to sales, as this can quickly lead to sales disregarding the product channel due to low close rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>.
*   **User Journey First**: Prioritize the user journey and engage sales only when it's the "right time" for the user, ensuring the sales interaction adds value rather than being disruptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. Accounts can go in and out of PQA status, so sales efforts should be sun-setted if contact isn't made and renewed later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.

### 2. Organizational Structure and Support

*   **Dedicated Resources**: For sales-led growth companies adding PLS, consider having a sales team member run a pilot with product, separating it from the main sales engine initially to prototype effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>.
*   **Founder/Product-Led Sales**: For [[product_led_growth | product-led growth]] companies, initially handle sales internally (e.g., support teams, finance, or even founders) to truly understand the sales process for customers before hiring dedicated salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. Notion, for example, didn't hire its first salesperson until past $10 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>, and Miro handled sales through their support team until $5-7 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>.
*   **Marketing Integration**: Marketing plays a crucial role in finding and connecting buyers to product usage, especially since most usage won't have an immediate buyer within the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Strong product marketers can provide invaluable support with messaging, outreach, and sales enablement materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.
*   **New Rituals**: Create new rituals and communication channels to foster alignment and collaboration between product and sales teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>.

### 3. Monetization Awareness and Product Design

*   **Expose Paid Functionality**: Ensure that paid features are visible and exposed to free users in the product, even if they are walled off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>. Product design reviews should consider how functionality is exposed across all customer states (free, lower paid, target paid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>.
*   **Monetization Awareness**: Track how many activated accounts view the pricing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, and use surveys to assess if customers understand what's included in paid plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. The "rule of three" from advertising suggests users need to see monetization triggers three times to remember them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.
*   **User Profiling**: Don't skip onboarding questions; profile users upon sign-up to understand who they are, their company size, department, seniority, and use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>. This data is crucial for segmentation, personalization, and determining if you have a buyer within the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Growth**: Understand that escalating an individual user problem to an enterprise solution typically takes 12+ months of usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. This process builds for long-term growth, as contracts are often closed from sign-ups that occurred the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.

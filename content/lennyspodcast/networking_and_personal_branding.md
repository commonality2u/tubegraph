This article explores key strategies for cultivating influence and advancing one's [[career_development_and_growth_strategies | career]], drawing insights from Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and author of "The Seven Rules of Power." These strategies, though sometimes perceived as uncomfortable, are presented as essential skills for navigating the realities of professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Jeffrey Pfeffer teaches that these are not about personality but are [[career_transition_advice_and_mentorship | skills that can be mastered]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>. The core premise is that to get things done and advance, one must build and wield power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## The Seven Rules of Power
Pfeffer's framework for building power includes seven rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>:
1.  Get out of your own way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>
2.  Break The Rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>
3.  Appear powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>
4.  [[building_a_brand_for_startups | Create a powerful brand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>
5.  [[strategies_for_creating_brand_awareness_and_effective_marketing | Network relentlessly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>
6.  Use your power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>
7.  Understand that once you've acquired power, what you did to get there will be forgiven or forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.

## [[building_a_brand_for_startups | Creating a Powerful Brand]] (Rule Four)
Building a powerful brand is crucial for [[career_development_and_growth_strategies | career advancement]] because there are fewer positions at the top, and individuals must differentiate themselves to be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. If people don't know who you are, they cannot choose you for opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

### Strategies for Brand Building
*   **Differentiation:** Keith Ferrazzi, working at Deloitte Consulting, started the Lincoln Quality Award instead of focusing on spreadsheets, creating value for the firm and himself. This led to his appointment as a partner and the first Chief Marketing Officer at Deloitte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Proactive Value Creation:** Tristan Walker, aiming to get hired at Foursquare, started signing up partnerships on his own, which eventually compelled the founder to hire him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   **Strategic Visibility:** Laura Chow, a successful venture capitalist at a less visible firm, actively built her brand through writing, starting a podcast featuring influential people, contributing to books, and hosting networking dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. She even leveraged her unique height and distinctive style to be more memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

While many associate personal branding with self-promotional activities like posting on LinkedIn, it can be reframed as amplifying the impact of your team or scaling yourself by sharing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Visibility without substance is useless, but substance without visibility remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_creating_brand_awareness_and_effective_marketing | Networking Relentlessly]] (Rule Five)
Many find networking uncomfortable, often viewing it as "dirty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. However, it's essential for acquiring power and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

### Principles of Effective Networking
*   **Generosity:** The first principle of networking is generosityâ€”focusing on what you can do for others, who you can introduce them to, or how you can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Acquisition:** A broader social network leads to knowing more people and acquiring more knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.
*   **Strategic Time Investment:** Omid Kordestani, an early Google employee, attributes his success to relentlessly networking inside and outside Netscape instead of strictly "doing his job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. This allowed him to become known and sought after when Google needed its first business person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>, ultimately making him a very powerful and wealthy individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Discomfort:** To make networking less "cringey," identify 10 people important to your career goals and strategize how to meet them, perhaps through shared articles, introductions, or holding small dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>.
*   **Become a Broker:** Connecting people who can benefit from knowing each other is a powerful form of networking. Venture capitalists, investment bankers, and real estate agents all act as brokers, connecting different parties for mutual benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. The more people you know, the more you can get done through others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
*   **Pursue Weak Ties:** Building connections with people different from you, rather than just those you're strongly tied to (friends, family, close colleagues), allows you to learn non-redundant information and encounter people you don't already know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. Research suggests jobs obtained through weak ties are often better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

## [[standing_out_in_interviews_and_job_candidacy | Showing Up in a Powerful Fashion]] (Rule Three)
How you present yourself visually and audibly significantly impacts how others perceive your power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. People respond mostly to how others look, secondarily to how they sound, and least to the content of what they say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

### Elements of a Powerful Presence
*   **Body Language and Appearance:** Tall people often earn more, and attractive people (within an optimal range) tend to earn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. Wearing heels to appear taller or adopting a unique style can contribute to a powerful impression, as exemplified by Laura Chow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.
*   **Vocal Presence:** A louder voice and more disinhibited laughs can convey power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.
*   **Confidence in Delivery:**
    *   Do not read from notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>.
    *   Maintain eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.
    *   Keep it brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.
    *   Avoid preemptive apologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
    *   Use more gestures and open body posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.
*   **Strategic Use of Emotion:** Anger, when outside the norm, can signal power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. Humor, as Salmah Rushdie noted, allows one to tell people anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.
*   **Physical Presence:** Invading personal space through gentle touching (e.g., on the arm or shoulder) and standing close can convey power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

These are learned skills. Just as an actor masters their craft, individuals can learn to command a room and present themselves powerfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>. Regis McKenna and his team famously helped Steve Jobs develop his presentation skills, transforming him from someone who couldn't sell water to someone who could sell anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. Jack Valenti, despite being 5'2", appeared taller due to his presence, body language, and mastery of material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

## From Knowing to Doing: Practicing Power
Pfeffer emphasizes overcoming the "Knowing-Doing Gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. His class assignments focus on implementation, such as:
*   Setting clear career goals and defining what success looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.
*   Assessing one's strengths and weaknesses in "attributes of power" and developing a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.
*   Actively creating resources or opportunities that provide leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.
*   Practicing powerful communication through video and receiving feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.
*   Developing a personal brand statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.

The approach involves starting with small, uncomfortable steps and gradually pushing oneself out of the comfort zone, similar to the 15% rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>. This deliberate practice, often with the help of coaches or a "personal board of directors," helps individuals build their power skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

Ultimately, these skills are tools. Like a hammer or a knife, they can be used for good or ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. As Pfeffer states, "If you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Laura Esserman, a breast cancer surgeon, provides a prime example of someone who learned to leverage power and influence to drive profound changes in medicine, despite initial reluctance and facing entrenched interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.

### The Price of Power
While acquiring power offers significant advantages, it comes with a price, often a lack of autonomy and increased public scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>. High-power positions often mean less control over one's schedule and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Privacy diminishes, and every aspect of one's life can be publicly dissected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. There is a "trust dilemma" where it becomes unclear if people associate with you for who you are or the position you hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>. This often impacts not only the individual but their family as well, with observed increases in suicides and divorce rates among powerful individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>.

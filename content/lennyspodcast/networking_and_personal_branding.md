Growing one's power and influence is crucial for [[career_growth_and_strategic_positioning | career advancement]], leading to promotions, job satisfaction, and reduced stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This is not about personality, but about skills that can be mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and author of *The Seven Rules of Power*, teaches that political skill is associated with positive outcomes like higher salary, promotions, and less stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The realities of acquiring power often don't align with conventional upbringing or societal ideals, which can make people uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. However, just as a hammer can be used for good or ill, so too can power; it is the tool, not the inherent nature, that matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Building a Powerful Brand

A key aspect of gaining power is to [[the_value_of_distinctiveness_and_fame_in_branding | create a powerful brand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. With fewer positions at the top of any hierarchy, differentiating oneself is essential for promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. People cannot choose what is not in their awareness, so it's not enough to be skilled; you must be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### Strategies for Personal Branding

*   **Differentiation**: Do something that makes you stand out and creates value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. For example, Keith Ferrazzi at Deloitte Consulting started the Lincoln Quality Award to boost the firm's brand recognition, eventually becoming its first Chief Marketing Officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Tristan Walker, seeking a job at Foursquare, initiated partnerships independently until the founder noticed and hired him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   **Visibility**: Laura Chow, a venture capitalist, built her brand by writing, starting a podcast with influential guests, contributing to a book, and hosting networking dinners to become known in the consumer tech space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. She also strategically emphasized unique physical traits, like her height, to be more memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Substance with Visibility**: While visibility is crucial, it must be paired with substance. Visibility without substance leads to being perceived as useless, but substance without visibility remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   **Reframing Self-Promotion**: Instead of self-promotion, think of it as amplifying the team's impact or scaling yourself by sharing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

## Networking Relentlessly

Another rule of power is to [[lowcost_growth_channels_and_community_engagement | network relentlessly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Many find networking uncomfortable because they view it incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

### Principles of Effective Networking

*   **Generosity**: The first principle of networking is generosity – asking "What can I do for you?" or "Who can I introduce you to?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. The broader your network, the more people and knowledge you acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.
*   **The Power of Asking**: As seen in personal relationships or business deals, people are unlikely to help or collaborate if you don't ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>. The worst outcome of asking is "no," leaving you no worse off than if you hadn't asked at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.
*   **Omid Kordestani Example**: Omid Kordestani, an early Google employee, spent his time at Netscape networking extensively both internally and externally, becoming widely known in Silicon Valley. This deep network led to him being the top recommendation for Google's first business person, securing his role as employee number 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.
*   **Making it Less "Cringey"**: Instead of traditional networking events, consider holding dinners (like John Levy suggests, where guests cook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>, sending relevant articles to contacts, or making introductions between people who could benefit from meeting each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. This is about connecting people who benefit from being connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
*   **Become a Broker**: Act as a connector between individuals or groups, similar to how venture capitalists connect ideas with money, or real estate agents connect buyers and sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
*   **Pursue Weak Ties**: Your close connections (strong ties) often share similar knowledge and networks. Building relationships with people who are more different from you (weak ties) helps you acquire non-redundant information and meet new people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. Research shows that jobs obtained through weak ties are often better than those found through formal applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>.

## Mastering the Skills: The "Knowing-Doing Gap"

Building power through branding and networking are learned skills, not innate personality traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. To effectively apply these principles, one must overcome the "knowing-doing gap"—the disconnect between understanding a concept and implementing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### Practical Application

*   **"Doing Power" Assignments**: Courses like Jeffrey Pfeffer's include assignments requiring students to put principles into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Examples include:
    *   **Goal Setting**: Define what success looks like for the class and what you want to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.
    *   **Self-Assessment & Development Plan**: Rate yourself on attributes of power (e.g., energy, focus, tolerating conflict) and build a development plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.
    *   **Resource Creation**: Actively create resources that provide leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.
    *   **Personal Brand Statement**: Define how you want to be known and seek feedback to refine it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.
*   **Gradual Progression**: Just as you wouldn't expect to swim the English Channel overnight, small, consistent efforts are key. Push yourself slightly outside your comfort zone, but not so much that it feels unachievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. This aligns with the "15% rule" of pushing just beyond your comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>.
*   **Seek [[role_of_mentorship_and_community_in_professional_development | social support]] and Coaching**: It's hard to do things alone. [[Building support networks Job search councils | Getting a coach]] or a personal board of directors provides advice, support, and accountability, which is essential for personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>. [[asking_for_help_and_leveraging_networks | Asking for help]] is an important part of getting out of your own way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>.

By approaching power acquisition as a set of learnable skills, individuals can overcome discomfort and make significant [[career_advancement_strategies | strides in their careers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

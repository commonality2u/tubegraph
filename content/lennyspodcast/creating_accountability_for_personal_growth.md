Graham Weaver, a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business and founder/CEO of Alpine Investors, observes that a common question he receives from students is, "What should I do with my life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of getting out of "autopilot mode" to lead a more intentional and fulfilling life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Escaping Autopilot Mode

Many people operate on autopilot, going through daily routines without intentionality or understanding why they do what they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. An unconscious daily routine might involve working out, commuting, emails, and meetings, without ever asking "where do I want to be going with my life? What's important to me in this world?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. This happens because a significant portion of our thoughts (95-98%) are subconscious, programmed by media, friends, parents, bosses, and societal pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

To break free, it's crucial to:
*   **Create Space** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>: Step out of the "fog of war" and make room for reflection.
*   **Ask Deep Questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>: Understand your intentions for each area of your life (career, relationships, health, spirituality, family) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Align Actions with Intentions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>: Ensure your calendar and daily activities reflect your true intentions.

This intentionality is the "magic" that helps you look back without regret and feel like you're fulfilling your purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Key Questions for Intentionality

To find what truly excites you, consider these questions:
*   "What would you do if you knew you wouldn't fail?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>
*   "If you didn't have to make money, what would you do?" (This reveals what you enjoy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>
*   "What's play for you that is work for other people?" (From Naval Ravikant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>
*   "What's the thing you really want to do but you're just too embarrassed to say it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>
*   "Who are some people that you admire and want to be more like, and what do they do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>
*   "What are some things you want to learn and how do you want to grow over the next 5-10 years?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>

## Frameworks for Personal Growth

Weaver shares several exercises to help individuals identify and pursue their true calling. These frameworks facilitate [[frameworks_for_growth_in_product_management | growth in product management]] and beyond.

### The Genie Framework

This exercise helps uncover what you truly want to commit your life to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
Imagine you find a magic lamp, and a Genie appears, offering one wish: whatever you dedicate your whole life and career to will turn out great. It will likely take longer and be harder than expected, but you'll be happy you pursued it, and it will exceed your wildest imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The question then is: "What would you wish for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

The answer often comes from the heart, absent the fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This "genie goal" is what you should pursue. While immediate action might be constrained by financial obligations or needed experience, the long-term goal is to embark on that path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### The Nine Lives Exercise

This exercise aims to make the intimidating task of finding a life passion more approachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.
1.  **List Nine Lives**: Envision nine different lives you could lead.
2.  **Life One**: This is your current life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.
3.  **Future Lives**: The remaining lives must start from today and be exciting to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. Examples include starting a private equity firm, becoming an author, a professor, an actor, or a social media content creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

The purpose of this exercise is twofold:
1.  **Identify Energy Sources**: Recognize which "lives" give you the most energy and consider how to incorporate aspects of that life into your current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. Even a small integration can boost your energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.
2.  **Long-Term Vision**: Realize that it's possible to experience many of these "lives" over the course of your full life, perhaps not simultaneously, but sequentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.

## Overcoming Obstacles to Growth

### Confronting Limiting Beliefs

Limiting beliefs are most dangerous when subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. To overcome them:
1.  **Write Them Down**: Get them out of your subconscious and onto paper. This immediately strips them of much of their power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
2.  **Translate to To-Do Items**: A scary, nebulous fear transforms into a concrete problem to solve, just like any other problem you've overcome in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

### Embracing "Worse First"

"Everything you want is on the other side of worse first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Any significant positive change, whether a better body or a new career, involves initial discomfort, pain, or difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. If you optimize only for immediate comfort (tomorrow), you will plateau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. Instead, ask what your five-year-future self would want you to do now, even if it means short-term pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.

### The "Not Now" Trap

Students often say "not now" instead of "I'm giving up" on their dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. However, "not now" can easily become "not ever." It's essential to realize that the "right time" to make a change rarely feels secure or safe; you'll likely always feel some fear or unreadiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. Waiting for perfect conditions means waiting your whole life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>.

### When to Quit

Quitting is acceptable when you can no longer see or believe in the vision, or when you are no longer excited about it for a sustained period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. While excitement might wane during difficult times, look for "green shoots" or "bright spots" that indicate progress. Scaling these bright spots can transform a struggling endeavor into a successful one over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.

## Strategies for Accountability

[[Importance of feedback and self-awareness in career growth | Accountability]] is crucial for [[developing_a_growth_model | personal growth]] and achieving goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.

### Executive Coaches

Hiring an executive coach is akin to hiring a personal trainer for your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. A coach can:
1.  **Create Space for Questions**: They provide dedicated time to reflect on big life questions across career, relationships, health, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.
2.  **Hold You Accountable**: Coaches ensure you follow through on your intentions and goals. Even a simple form outlining yearly goals, weekly progress, and call outcomes can be incredibly powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.

### Peer Accountability

If a coach isn't feasible, find a like-minded friend to hold each other accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. Regularly meet to discuss your dreams, hopes, and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. Talking about your goals activates different parts of your brain more effectively than just thinking or writing about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>.

### The Power of Writing Down Goals

Regularly writing down your primary goal and three actions you'll take towards it daily is a simple yet incredibly powerful practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>. This locks your subconscious mind into your goals, who you want to be, and how you want to show up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.

## The Internal Game of Life

Weaver states that the "true Game of Life is an internal one, not an external one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. While basic external needs are important, for most, the vast majority of life is internal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. Much of what we strive for—happiness, worthiness, respect, admiration—is based on stories we've created about what we need to achieve externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. Realizing these are "just a story" is initially terrifying but ultimately liberating, offering agency over what truly matters to you on an [[importance_of_selfawareness_and_personal_operating_principles | internal scorecard]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.

As Weaver experienced personally, achieving an external goal (like financial success) might not change internal feelings of self-worth or happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. This realization shifts the focus to finding joy internally, rather than through external achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.

Ultimately, with only one life, it's vital to take the time to define what a "wonderful, amazing, incredible life" looks like across all domains—career, relationships, health, finances, and spirituality. Getting clear on this vision is the first, most magical step toward making it a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>.

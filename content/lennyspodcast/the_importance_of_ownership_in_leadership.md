[[Leadership and company culture | Company culture]] at Amazon, particularly under Jeff Bezos, was built on core [[Cultural elements fostering team ownership and impact | leadership principles]] that emphasized taking ownership and fostering an [[Entrepreneurial mindset and leadership insights | entrepreneurial mindset]]. This principle, "Ownership," highlights the critical role individuals play in the success of their teams and the broader organization.

## The Amazon Leadership Principle of Ownership

The "Ownership" principle at Amazon was developed through several revisions of its core [[Cultural elements fostering team ownership and impact | leadership principles]] over 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>. When consolidating various lists of values and principles, the concept of "ownership" was initially removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. However, a group of directors, including Ethan Evans, recognized its vital importance and advocated for its reinstatement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

Ethan Evans specifically proposed the impactful phrase, "An owner never says, 'that's not my job'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This phrase became a part of the official Amazon [[Cultural elements fostering team ownership and impact | leadership principle]] and has remained to this day, influencing millions of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>. This demonstrates that good ideas can influence decision-makers even at the highest levels of a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.

## Learning from Failure: A Case Study in Ownership

Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon, shares a significant [[Lessons in leadership and team management | lesson in leadership]] from a major project failure during his tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>. Tasked with launching the Amazon App Store, a critical feature that allowed users to "test drive" apps in a web browser, the system encountered database problems on launch day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. This delayed a public launch letter from Jeff Bezos himself, leading to considerable frustration from the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

To navigate this crisis, Ethan applied key principles of ownership and [[Managing up and leadership communication | communication]]:
*   **Admit and Own the Problem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>: Despite the immense pressure, Ethan immediately owned the issue, stating, "Yes, it's not working, it's my fault, I will deal with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>. Deflecting blame is counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.
*   **Proactive and Timely Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>: Ethan began sending hourly updates to Jeff Bezos and other senior [[Leadership and management development | leaders]], detailing the problem, the plan, and the next update time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>. This consistent communication aimed to rebuild trust and prevent micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.
*   **Seek and Accept Help** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>: When senior [[Leadership and management development | leaders]] reached out to offer assistance, Ethan accepted help from AWS engineers who provided a solution to the database problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.
*   **Face the Challenge Directly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>: Instead of avoiding an in-person meeting with Jeff Bezos, Ethan chose to attend and even sat next to the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>. This direct engagement helped to rebuild trust and foster a more human conversation, where anger is harder to sustain face-to-face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.
*   **Persevere and Re-earn Trust** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>: Despite the public failure and initial loss of trust, Ethan continued to work hard and demonstrate his ability to learn and launch reliably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. He was ultimately promoted to Vice President two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.

This experience highlights that major mistakes are not necessarily career-ending if handled with ownership, proactivity, and a commitment to learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. Ethan advises against quitting due to shame, emphasizing that people often feel more "dead in the water" than they actually are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

## Ownership and Career Progression

The "Magic Loop" is a five-step process for career growth, which implicitly relies on ownership of one's career journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. It begins with performing one's current job well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, then proactively asking how to help one's manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, and following through on those commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The "magic" occurs when the individual then asks how they can help their manager in a way that also helps them achieve their own career goals, such as a promotion or new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

This loop works because managers are inclined to help those who help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. It transforms the employee-manager relationship from an oppositional one to a partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, where the employee takes active ownership of their professional development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. It encourages clarity on personal goals and proactively addressing skill gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

For senior roles, particularly at the director and VP levels, ownership evolves from asking what needs to be done to anticipating needs and proactively acting on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. [[Effective leadership and strategic thinking | Leaders]] are expected to think strategically and long-term, not just manage details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Success at these levels requires demonstrating next-level skills before being promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

## The Connection to Inventiveness and Bias for Action

Jeff Bezos considered himself primarily an inventor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, aiming to build Amazon as "The Invention Machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. [[Curiosity and its role in leadership | Inventiveness]] involves systematically dedicating time to thinking and combining existing concepts to create new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. This requires ownership of the problem space and a proactive approach to finding solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

Another key Amazon [[Cultural elements fostering team ownership and impact | leadership principle]] connected to ownership is "Bias for Action," which emphasizes speed and the reversibility of many decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. This principle encourages [[Effective leadership and strategic thinking | leaders]] to move quickly and be decisive, even at the risk of making "bad gambles," because waiting for perfect certainty can lead to being outmaneuvered by competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. This highlights the importance of taking initiative and owning the outcome, rather than being paralyzed by fear of failure. Ethan's own misstep with the App Store launch was a result of prioritizing date over perfect certainty, a manifestation of Bias for Action that required him to learn a new lesson in balancing speed with avoiding negative "New York Times headlines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

In conclusion, ownership in [[Lessons in leadership and team management | leadership and team management]] is about taking full responsibility for one's actions and outcomes, proactively seeking opportunities to contribute, managing relationships, and continuously learning from both successes and failures. It is a cornerstone of [[Leadership and management development | professional development]] and organizational success.

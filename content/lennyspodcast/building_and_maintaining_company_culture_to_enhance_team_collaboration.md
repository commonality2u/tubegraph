Mahika Kapor, a design engineering PM hybrid at Figma, is highly regarded for her ability to lead new "0 to 1" products and cultivate strong company culture. Colleagues praise her knack for [[Creating a Strong Product Culture | creating a vision]] and inspiring others [00:00:12]. Her insights emphasize that culture is paramount for enhancing team collaboration and ensuring success within an organization [00:01:38].

## The Importance of Culture
Mahika believes that [[impact_of_company_culture_on_product_development | culture is everything]] [01:05:07]. Product management (PMing) is inherently a collaborative function, and fostering great relationships between teams is crucial for product success and making daily work more enjoyable [00:59:22]. When team members feel like they are working with friends, it makes the day-to-day experience much more fun [00:59:34].

Culture builds trust between groups of people [01:05:07]. While roadmaps and products may change, the connection felt between colleagues makes a team more durable. This means that when challenges arise, the team's instinct is to rally and collaborate to find solutions rather than disengage [01:05:36]. Passion for work stems from both passion for the vision being built and passion for the people you work with [01:05:23].

## Figma's Culture Initiatives
Mahika has been instrumental in shaping Figma's internal culture, acting as a "culture carrier" for the company [00:58:02]. Some notable initiatives she has contributed to include:

*   **Hot Seat**
    This tradition was started by Mahika at Figma's first post-pandemic PM offsite in March 2022 to help the team, then under 15 people, get to know each other outside of work [00:59:45]. In "Hot Seat," each person gets two minutes on the clock, and others can ask them anything [00:59:50]. The game often delves into people's backgrounds and motivations, fostering a deeper understanding of what drives individuals [01:00:40]. The tradition has since spread throughout the company, used when new team members join or when meeting significant others [01:01:14].

*   **The Figgies**
    Inspired by Figma's annual sales kickoff awards ceremony, Mahika orchestrated "The Figgies," an Oscar-style awards event for the product team [01:01:45]. This involved decorating a boardroom with a red carpet and gold curtains, purchasing Oscar trophies, and voting for humorous and absurd categories, such as "most likely to name their child Figma" [01:02:33]. The aim was to make people feel appreciated for their unique quirks and energy, celebrating the team's diversity [01:03:01]. Mahika notes that this high-impact event was achieved with a very low budget and minimal effort, demonstrating that impactful cultural initiatives don't require extensive resources [01:06:46].

## [[Developing and Implementing Company Values | Company Values]] and [[Building a Startup Culture | Entrepreneurial Culture]]
Figma's [[Developing and Implementing Company Values | core values]] significantly contribute to its culture:
*   **Play** [01:03:37]: This value emphasizes that work should be fun, encouraging team gatherings and activities that foster connection even in a remote-first environment [01:03:45].
*   **Run With It** [01:17:04]: This value encourages employees to independently pursue new ideas, seeing such initiatives not as distractions but as manifestations of the company's core values. This fosters an [[building_a_startup_culture | entrepreneurial culture]] where new ideas can flourish from the bottom up [01:17:08].

Many of Figma's most successful product launches, including multi-edit, Jambot (an AI plugin), and the entire widgets platform, originated from hackathons and bottom-up initiatives [01:17:24]. This demonstrates Figma's commitment to [[building_a_culture_and_platform_for_experimentation | celebrating and supporting internal entrepreneurship]] [01:18:01]. To stay competitive, a company must remain entrepreneurial, constantly thinking about what's next and defining industry standards [01:16:39].

## Cultivating New Ideas and Spreading Hype
Mahika likens pushing a new idea to being the "Keeper of the Flame," responsible for stoking the embers and ensuring the idea spreads like wildfire [01:19:11]. This involves:

1.  **Having the Right Idea:** This stems from deep user empathy, achieved by constantly engaging in conversations with users to understand their pain points, tool usage, and general perceptions [01:21:18]. It's also critical to ensure the idea aligns with broader company goals, such as Figma's transition from building for designers to covering the entire product development cycle [01:21:50].
2.  **Securing Buy-in:** Mahika emphasizes the need for "optimism that borders on delusion" and an "almost reality distortion field" to get leadership and teams excited about a new idea [01:23:18]. She shares her experience of pitching her current product multiple times, initially with limited success, until a hackathon. During the hackathon, she strategically made the new product feel more real by subtly changing icons and leveraging the demo day for maximum impact [01:25:21].
3.  **Spreading the Idea:** This is where the hype factor comes in. Figma's multi-month "dogfooding" process, where products are put on staging early, is crucial [01:27:10]. This not only provides valuable feedback but also invests people in the product's success. When individuals see their feedback implemented, they feel they "shaped that part of the product," fostering collective ownership and driving the product forward [01:28:23].

Mahika believes that if you have a unique insight, it's your responsibility to "shout it from the rooftops" to get others on board. This individual initiative contributes to a more entrepreneurial culture within the company [01:29:41].

## Individual Motivation and Team Dynamics
Understanding individual motivations is key to [[building_and_managing_a_successful_tech_team | running a team successfully]] and driving ideas forward [01:30:09]. Different team members, from engineers to designers and researchers, have varying desires for involvement in the product visioning phase [01:30:20]. Some prefer clear solutions, while others need to contribute to feel passionate about a project [01:30:33]. Directly asking team members how much they want to be involved in product decisions and making decisions in the open, even with a leading point of view, ensures everyone has the opportunity to voice their perspective and push back, fostering a truly collaborative environment [01:31:21].

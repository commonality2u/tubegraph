The journey of Whiz, a rapidly growing software company, exemplifies the critical role of [[Product Market Fit | product-market fit]] and attentive [[The impact of user feedback on product development | user feedback]] in a startup's success. As the first product manager at Whiz (initially called Beyond Networks), Ros Herberg experienced firsthand the challenges of an unclear product direction and the transformative power of a pivot based on genuine [[customer_feedback_and_product_improvement | customer feedback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Identifying a Lack of Product-Market Fit

When Ros joined Whiz, the founders didn't have a solid idea figured out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. They eventually landed on an idea for network security, despite the founding team's background in cloud security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. In the initial weeks, the team would hold 10 to 15 meetings daily with potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. During these calls, where the team presented their idea via a deck without a solid product, potential customers would often respond with polite affirmations like "Oh, sounds interesting" or "Would love to hear more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

However, these positive reinforcements were misleading. Ros, as the first product manager, found herself confused, still not understanding exactly what they were going to build after weeks of calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. She realized that customers aren't incentivized to deep-dive or reveal their lack of understanding; they might simply be polite or assume the smart founders are building something interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

This confusion led Ros to directly ask, "What exactly are we doing here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This question, though scary to ask, opened a deep discussion and revealed that the team was "listening in the wrong way," looking for positive reinforcements rather than signs of deep enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This realization led to a pivot to cloud security, an area where the team had prior expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

## Signals of Product-Market Fit

Once the team pivoted to cloud security, the conversations with customers changed dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. The signals of [[Product Market Fit | product-market fit]] were clear:

*   **Change in Questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>: Instead of general interest, customers started asking specific questions about pricing ("How are you pricing this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>) and purchasing ("When can we start doing a PO?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>).
*   **Proactive Engagement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>: Customers would proactively offer to connect the team to relevant people in their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Commitment to Next Steps** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>: Customers would push for the next step, like a Proof of Value (POV), and even complete demanding technical questionnaires quickly, demonstrating genuine desire for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. This indicates strong "pull" from the customer, as opposed to the company pushing the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

The ability to schedule 10-15 calls a day, especially during the early COVID-19 pandemic when CISOs were more available, was crucial for gathering this intensive [[customer_feedback_and_product_improvement | customer feedback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

## Strategies for Achieving Product-Market Fit

### Prioritizing Clear Communication

A key [[strategies_for_achieving_productmarket_fit | strategy for achieving product-market fit]] highlighted is the need for crystal-clear communication about the product. Ros, reflecting on her transition from product to marketing, realized that product teams often use technical jargon or fuzzy descriptions that don't translate well when scaling the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. For example, using technical initials like "CNAPP" (Cloud Native Application Protection) when buyers are Googling "Cloud security solution" creates a disconnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

This led to the concept of the "dummy explanation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. It's vital for companies to constantly remind themselves that customers don't live in their "bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. Every message must be understandable by anyone, without assuming deep knowledge of the product or market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.

### Founder-Led Sales (Initially)

In the early days of Whiz, things moved so fast that the founders themselves were closing deals before a dedicated sales team was hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. This hands-on approach allowed them to learn invaluable lessons directly from the sales process. It demonstrated that if the core founding team cannot achieve initial sales (or other core functions), it's "wishful" to expect an external hire to solve that problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This direct engagement ensured the product's value was deeply understood and communicated.

### Cultural Openness

The culture at Whiz, particularly the founding team's willingness to allow employees like Ros to question fundamental assumptions (e.g., "I don't understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>), was crucial. This openness allowed for the critical pivot that ultimately led to hypergrowth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. A culture that encourages vulnerability and allows for questions, even from junior employees, can be a significant asset in identifying [[challenges_in_achieving_productmarket_fit | challenges in achieving product-market fit]] and adapting quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

Whiz's journey, hitting $100 million ARR just 18 months after founding, highlights that achieving [[Product Market Fit | product market fit]] is not just about having a good idea, but about continuous [[integrating_customer_feedback_into_product_development | integration of customer feedback]], clear communication, and a strong internal culture that enables rapid adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39">[01:39]</a>.

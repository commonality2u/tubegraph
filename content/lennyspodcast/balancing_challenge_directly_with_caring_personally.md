Balancing challenging directly with caring personally is the core idea behind [[Radical Candor]]. This approach, developed by Kim Scott, emphasizes that effective feedback and management occur when these two dimensions are equally present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Kim Scott's book, *Radical Candor*, has sold over 1 million copies and has been translated into 23 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Two Dimensions of Radical Candor

Radical Candor is understood through a 2x2 framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>:
*   **Vertical Axis**: Care Personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   **Horizontal Axis**: Challenge Directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>

### What Radical Candor Is Not

Kim Scott identifies three common pitfalls when one or both dimensions are neglected:

#### 1. Obnoxious Aggression
This occurs when you [[Overcoming fear of giving candid feedback | challenge directly]] but fail to show that you [[Overcoming fear of giving candid feedback | care personally]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. It's often mistaken for Radical Candor, but it involves acting like a "garden variety jerk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This approach is problematic because it hurts others and is inefficient; when someone is subjected to obnoxious aggression, they enter a "fight or flight" mode and literally cannot hear what is being said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It can also lead to a reaction of avoiding future direct challenges, resulting in manipulative insincerity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

#### 2. Ruinous Empathy
This is the most common problem, occurring when you remember to [[Overcoming fear of giving candid feedback | care personally]] but fail to tell someone something they would be better off knowing in the long run due to fear of hurting their feelings or offending them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Approximately 90% of mistakes fall into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Ruinous empathy creates a "false harmony" that is ultimately detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

> [!example] The "Bob" Story
> Kim Scott recounts a story of "Bob," a charming and popular employee whose work was consistently terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. Scott, concerned about hurting his feelings, would offer vague feedback like, "Bob, this is such a great start, you're so awesome, we all love working with you, maybe you can make it just a little bit better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This continued for ten months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. Eventually, Scott had to fire Bob because his poor performance was negatively impacting the entire team, causing frustration and delaying deliverables for high-performing employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Bob's question, "Why didn't anyone tell me? I thought you all cared about me," highlighted that Scott's ruinous empathy, combined with a fear of damaging her own reputation (manipulative insincerity), ultimately caused greater pain and harm to Bob and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

#### 3. Manipulative Insincerity
This is the "worst place of all," where neither care nor challenge is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. It often stems from self-protective motives or extreme frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Impact of Radical Candor
When individuals develop the skill of Radical Candor, it leads to:
*   Building better relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
*   Doing better work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
*   Increased success and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>

## Practical Advice for Giving Feedback (Challenging Directly)

While there's no single "script" for Radical Candor because it needs to sound authentic to the individual, there are key considerations:

*   **Be Humble**: Approach conversations with the understanding that you might be wrong; candor is a dialogue, not a monologue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **State Your Intention to Be Helpful**: Make it explicit that the feedback is meant to help the other person, not to dominate or harm them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Do It Immediately**: Deliver feedback as soon as possible, unless you are too upset to communicate effectively or the other person is too upset to hear you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Delaying feedback often means it will never be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **Communicate Synchronously**: Have these conversations in person or, if not possible, via phone call. Avoid email or text, as there is "more noise than signal in facial expressions and body language" in video calls, and written communication lacks the ability to gauge real-time reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
*   **Praise in Public, Criticize in Private**: This general rule helps reinforce positive behaviors broadly and address sensitive issues respectfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Focus on Behavior, Not Personality**: Feedback should be about specific actions or behaviors, not inherent personality traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Use the **CORE** framework:
    *   **C**ontext: Where and when did it happen? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>
    *   **O**bservation: What did the person do/say? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>
    *   **R**esult: What was the impact? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>
    *   **E** (Next Step): What should they do differently or continue doing? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>
    > [!example] Kim Scott's "Um" Story
    > Kim Scott's boss at Google provided Radical Candor when Scott frequently used "um" during presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. The feedback progressed from gentle ("You said 'um' a lot in there, were you aware of it?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a> to direct ("I can tell when you do that thing with your hand [brushing off feedback] then I'm gonna have to be a lot more direct with you. When you say 'um' every third word, it makes you sound stupid") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This directness, coupled with a demonstrated care for Scott's career, was the "kindest thing" for her career at that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The boss knew Scott well enough to use these specific words, which she wouldn't have used with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Practical Advice for Getting Feedback (Caring Personally)

To foster a culture of Radical Candor, especially in a company where people may not be ready for direct feedback, the most important first step is to **solicit criticism** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. This builds relationships and makes it easier to give and receive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.

1.  **Ask a Good Question**: Avoid generic questions like "Do you have any feedback for me?" as they often elicit "Oh, no, everything's fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead, ask something authentic to you that demands a response. Examples include:
    *   "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>
    *   "Tell me why I'm wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>
    *   "What's one thing I could be doing better?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>
    *   "What could I have done this week to better support you in your work?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>

2.  **Make it a Routine**: Managers should solicit feedback weekly from each direct report, typically budgeting five minutes at the end of a one-on-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. Also ask cross-functional peers and your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>.

3.  **Embrace the Discomfort**: The other person will likely feel uncomfortable. The simplest way to manage this is to "close your mouth and count to six" to allow them space to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. If they still offer no feedback, explain that you are not perfect and genuinely need their insights to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

4.  **Listen to Understand, Not to Respond**: It's natural to feel defensive, but manage this reaction by asking follow-up questions to truly understand their perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

5.  **Reward the Candor**: This is the most crucial step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.
    *   **If you agree**: Fix the problem and make your listening tangible by being loud about the change you made based on their feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>. Ask for follow-up feedback (e.g., "Did I overcorrect or undercorrect?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
    *   **If you disagree**: Acknowledge the part you can agree with (5-10% of their feedback) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. Then, state, "As for the rest of it, I want to think about it and get back to you," and actually follow up with a respectful explanation for your disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. Unspoken disagreement, not disagreement itself, poses a risk to relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

> [!tip] It Saves Time
> While it may seem like a lot of work, practicing Radical Candor saves tremendous amounts of time in the long run by preventing bigger problems, akin to "a stitch in time saves nine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. These "two-minute impromptu moments of management" are more important than being on time to the next meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

## Overcoming "People Pleaser" Tendencies

Many leaders, often out of a desire to be liked, struggle to give direct feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. To overcome this:
*   **Shift Focus**: Realize your job is not to be liked, but to genuinely care about others and to be "others-focused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
*   **Reframe Kindness**: Understand that it's actually **unkind** in the long run *not* to tell someone if they are making a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.
*   **Connect to Career Goals**: When giving feedback, focus on what the other person wants for their future and how the feedback will help them achieve their goals (e.g., getting promoted) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Managers should have real, meaningful [[career_conversations | career conversations]] to understand what motivates their direct reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

## Addressing Company Culture Challenges

When a company culture is not welcoming of direct feedback, leaders can still initiate change:
*   **Lead by Example**: Begin by consistently soliciting criticism yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.
*   **Show Impact**: Explain to leaders and team members the practical inefficiencies of obnoxious aggression (e.g., people can't hear you) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a> and the detrimental effects of ruinous empathy (e.g., losing top performers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. Frame it in terms of "enlightened self-interest" – how it helps their own success and the company's results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.
*   **Share Personal Mistakes**: Leaders sharing stories of when they acted like a "jerk" helps others adopt a [[Overcoming fear of giving candid feedback | growth mindset]] and feel more comfortable identifying their own areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.

## Distinguishing Radical Candor from Harmful Approaches

Radical Candor is not about being a "total jerk but really competent" or "really nice but incompetent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>. It offers a "better way that works better and doesn't hurt people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

> [!caution] Not Bridgewater's "Radical Transparency"
> Kim Scott explicitly distinguishes Radical Candor from the highly confrontational and public feedback culture at Bridgewater Associates, as described in *The Fund* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>. Scott cites an anecdote where public, personal criticism led to an employee crying, and the recording was then circulated company-wide as an example of feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Scott calls this "deep dark obnoxious aggression" and notes that Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio's book *Principles* has very little focus on "caring personally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.

While figures like Steve Jobs could be "obnoxiously aggressive," he also built profound relationships where even harsh feedback was understood within a context of deep care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Radical Candor is "measured not at the speaker's mouth but at the listener's ear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.

## Radical Respect

Kim Scott's upcoming book, *Radical Respect*, is a prequel to *Radical Candor* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. It addresses the foundational element of respect necessary for genuine care and challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. The book was inspired by feedback from a Black woman CEO who faced accusations of being an "angry black woman" when giving even gentle criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>. *Radical Respect* covers:
*   What leaders can do.
*   Actions if you are harmed by bias, prejudice, or bullying.
*   How to be a great "upstander" or better colleague.
*   How to become part of the solution when you are the "culprit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

## Tactical Next Step

To start building the muscle of Radical Candor, write down your authentic "go-to question" for soliciting feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. Practice it in front of a mirror, then with a friend, and refine it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>. Then, put five minutes in your calendar to ask that question of someone you work closely with, either in a dedicated interaction or by adding it to your next one-on-one agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.

Ultimately, remember: "You do not have to choose between being successful and being a jerk. You can be a successful kind person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.

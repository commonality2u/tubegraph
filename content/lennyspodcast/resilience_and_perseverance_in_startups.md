Dalton Caldwell, a managing director and group partner at [[lessons_from_y_combinator_experience_with_startups | Y Combinator]] (YC) for over 10 years, emphasizes the critical role of resilience and perseverance for startup founders. Having worked with more startups than almost anyone, including early days of companies like Instacart, Retool, Brex, DoorDash, and Webflow, Caldwell provides tactical advice on the startup journey, stressing the importance of not losing hope and preventing a startup from dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## The "Don't Die" Mantra

A core philosophy shared by Dalton Caldwell is the simple, pragmatic advice: "sell, make money, don't run out of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Caldwell's mantra is simply "just don't die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This constant affirmation reminds founders that continuing to keep going and performing "high quality reps" is the essence of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Even the best in the world need to be coached and reminded of the fundamentals and basics to stay in the right mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## The Irrational Act of Persistence

Based on analysis of numerous startup stories at YC, the underlying theme is that, rationally, founders often *should* have given up at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. For example, Airbnb's founders probably should have shut down three or four times before even joining YC; their venture objectively wasn't working, and they were essentially ruining their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Yet, it was a "purely irrational act" for them to keep working on their "goofy startup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

This [[key_attributes_of_successful_startup_founders | irrational intention to keep going]] is crucial, even when the world indicates failure and founders feel completely defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Many founders must go through multiple near-death experiences before eventually getting "lucky" and appearing as an overnight success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

### Why Startups Fail: Losing Hope

While [[common_reasons_startups_fail_and_how_to_avoid_them | not talking to customers]] is a common reason for [[common_reasons_startups_fail_and_how_to_avoid_them | startup failure]], Caldwell argues that a deeper cause is often founders losing hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>. It's rare for a company to die simply because it ran out of money while the founders were still positive and had more ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:00">[38:22:00]</a>. More often, startups fail when founders still have some money left but decide they're "done," "out of ideas," or no longer want to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:30:00">[38:30:00]</a>. Losing conviction due to a product not working or conflicts with co-founders are common causes of shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a>.

## When to Consider Giving Up

While persistence is vital, there are nuanced situations where giving up might be the right move. Caldwell advises founders to consider:
*   **Enjoyment** Do you still enjoy what you're doing? Do you enjoy spending time with your co-founders? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>
*   **Love for the Product and Customers** Do you still love your customers and your product? In the Airbnb story, the founders genuinely loved Airbnb and working with each other, even when things were going badly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. This passion can be a signal to keep going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Well-being** Is the venture profoundly affecting you negatively, including your relationships with people in your life or your team? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>
*   **Ideas for Growth** Have you truly run out of ideas to make it grow? If you have half a dozen or a dozen "really good grow ideas" that haven't been tried yet, give them a shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>.

Caldwell notes that if you're having a really bad time, it's not a big deal to shut down a company. Most people won't remember in 10 or 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. As long as you maintain integrity and handle yourself well, people will remember you fondly. Life is short, and forcing yourself to do something that makes you miserable just to avoid "losing face" has a significant opportunity cost on your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.

## Near-Death Experiences are Universal

It's common for founders to feel like "all hope is lost" at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Every single founder goes through a "near-death experience" where they seriously wonder if it's all going to be over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:51:00">[39:51:00]</a>.

### Brex and Retool: From "Worst" to Success

Caldwell recalls a specific YC batch (Winter 2017) where founders felt their batch was struggling. One company, Vyond (which later became Brex), was a VR headset company from Stanford dropouts that felt ashamed of their idea and considered shutting down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. Another, Cashew (which became Retool), a P2P Venmo competitor in the UK, was also struggling and not growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

If one had asked people in the batch what the "worst" company was, they likely would have pointed to Vyond and Cashew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. However, through a [[startup_pivot_and_adaptation_in_tech_space | pivot]]:
*   Vyond changed its idea, got excited about it, and renamed to Brex, which became a decacorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.
*   Cashew changed its idea, renamed to Retool, and also became hugely successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

In retrospect, the companies that objectively seemed the worst in that group became the most successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. This illustrates that founders often "come this close to it all being over, and through sheer will, kind of just keep it going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:00">[40:11:00]</a>.

## Building Conviction and Optimism

Conviction in a startup often isn't present from day one but is built over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:32:00">[51:32:00]</a>. As the product gains traction and customers reflect back positive data, founders become more obsessed with their company, creating a "network effect virtual cycle" of growing belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:34:00">[51:34:00]</a>.

The most successful founders deeply want their companies to succeed and truly believe in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:00">[49:00:00]</a>. They possess a deep internal conviction that they are "the one" and will not accept failure, even when faced with overwhelming negative data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:00">[49:15:00]</a>. This internal gravitational force can be so powerful that it warps the world to bend to their will, convincing employees and others that success is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:48:00">[49:48:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Fear of Failure

Failures are a part of the startup journey. Caldwell himself has made bad investments and experienced many things in his own startups that "didn't work out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>. The key lesson is not to let failures get to you too much, and to "keep going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. If you persist, these failures often won't define you and will eventually be forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>. Fear of failure should not dominate thoughts; instead, energy and positivity should be used to continue striving for good work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. Maintaining optimism and energy is essential for a long career in the startup world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

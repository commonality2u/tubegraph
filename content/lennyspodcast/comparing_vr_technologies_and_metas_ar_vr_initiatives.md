Andrew "Boz" Bosworth, Chief Technology Officer of Meta, has been instrumental in the company's AR/VR efforts, leading [[the_evolving_landscape_of_ai_technology | Meta's Reality Labs]] organization since its creation in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:38">[01:37:38]</a>. This division focuses on augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality, and consumer hardware, including Quest and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58">[01:42:58]</a>.

## Evolution of Products and Personal Passion
Bosworth's career at Meta, which began in 2006 as one of Facebook's first engineers, has seen him build impactful products like the Facebook News Feed and the original Facebook mobile ads platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>. The News Feed was the first algorithmically ranked content feed for any social network and utilized Facebook's very first [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | AI code]] to rank content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:06">[03:31:06]</a>. This history underscores Meta's long-standing investment in and application of advanced technologies, including [[the_evolving_landscape_of_ai_technology | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>.

Bosworth initially had reservations about working on ads or hardware, having identified as an [[the_evolving_landscape_of_ai_technology | AI]] infrastructure product person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:44">[03:59:44]</a>. However, he found passion in these new areas, highlighting that sometimes you need to "give yourself the space to understand if I can get passionate about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:39">[03:38:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:15">[03:42:15]</a>.

## Comparing VR Headsets: Apple Vision Pro vs. Meta Quest 3

Boz and Mark Zuckerberg jointly tried the Apple Vision Pro headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. Their initial reaction was a "sigh of relief" because the technology inside the Vision Pro did not represent a "fundamental breakthrough" that Meta couldn't have achieved, with the exception of Apple silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.

### Key Comparative Points:

*   **Display Resolution & Performance**: While Apple silicon offers a 2x linear scaling advantage, display resolution scaling is a quadratic proposition, meaning the benefit isn't as significant as one might expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. The Apple Vision Pro excels in high-resolution movie watching while stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.
*   **Pass-through Technology**: Apple's pass-through is noted for its quality when stationary and looking straight ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. However, Meta's Quest 3 offers less persistence and motion blur in mixed reality use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.
*   **User Interface (UI) & Polish**: Apple received praise for its "beautiful UI polishes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **Eye Tracking**: Apple's eye tracking system requires prescription inserts, as it shoots cameras through the lens, which is why it doesn't support wearing regular glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. Quest Pro's eye tracking, coming from the side, allows for corrective lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.
*   **Hand Tracking & Controllers**: Meta believes its hand tracking is superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>. Bosworth was "really adamant" that hand tracking and mixed reality were critical features for Meta's headsets to become mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:25">[02:41:25]</a>. He pushed for high performance benchmarks for hand tracking, even when teams told him it was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:51">[02:50:51]</a>. Quest also includes controllers, which Boz argues expands capabilities, similar to how a mouse complements a keyboard for computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>.
*   **Field of View & Comfort**: The Apple Vision Pro's field of view is described as "really small" and distracting, especially once eye relief is factored in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. Meta's displays are brighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>.
*   **Price and Value**: The Quest 3 is positioned as the "best value headset," costing significantly less at around $500 compared to Apple Vision Pro's $3500 price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. Bosworth encourages people to try both devices and consider if they'd prefer seven Quest 3s or one Apple Vision Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. He highlights that Quest 3 can also do remote desktop and support multiple virtual monitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.

Boz concludes that if given a choice, he would personally take the Quest 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. Mark Zuckerberg's public video comparing the two products was a direct communication of their belief that Quest 3 is a "literally a better device" and not a strategic "four-dimensional chess" move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.

## Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses

Beyond VR headsets, Meta has also developed Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Bosworth personally uses these for filming his children without putting a camera in their faces, finding it "awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. He also highlighted the multimodal [[the_evolving_landscape_of_ai_technology | AI]] assistant capability, where users can use the camera to ask Meta's [[the_evolving_landscape_of_ai_technology | AI]] assistant about things they see, even receiving directions or information about surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.

There are also strong rumors about Meta developing glasses with full AR capabilities, with internal demonstrations showing features like displaying notes during speeches and controlling slides with gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. Boz even jokingly referred to a Mercedes-Benz EQS car as the "best augmented reality product" due to its advanced display features that project turns in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24">[01:35:24]</a>.

## Conclusion

Meta's commitment to AR/VR and mixed reality is a significant long-term investment, alongside [[the_evolving_landscape_of_ai_technology | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. While the company faced public perception challenges and stock downturns, which it attributes partly to ineffective communication about future investments, it remains steadfast in its vision for these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>.

Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe, shares insights into how design, quality, and beauty are not merely aesthetic considerations but fundamental drivers of business growth and team performance. She discusses strategies for embedding a culture of quality throughout an organization, drawing from her experience at hypergrowth companies like Airbnb, Lyft, and Stripe.

## The Indispensable Role of Beauty and Quality in Product Design

The perception that functionality is paramount and beauty is secondary or opposite is a misconception [00:00:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. In fact, beauty enhances functionality by making products easier to use, more approachable, and more compelling [00:00:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Data from Google's digitized books shows a dramatic decrease in the use of the word "beauty" from the 1800s to the 2000s, reflecting a cultural shift towards prioritizing pure functionality [00:22:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

Beyond usability, beauty also builds trust [00:00:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. When users see meticulous attention to detail in a product's design, it assures them that the creators care about all aspects, even those not immediately visible [00:00:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This emotional connection is often overlooked in business discussions but is crucial [00:00:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Katie Dill identifies different levels of quality in product development:
*   **Baseline Quality**: The product works and provides value, fulfilling its basic job [00:11:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Error-Free and Well-Rounded**: The product performs consistently without errors [00:12:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Exceeding Expectations**: The product delights users by offering unexpected benefits [00:12:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

User expectations should drive the level of quality pursued [00:12:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. While users might not directly ask for higher levels of polish, competition demands it. Early cars, for instance, had little competition and thus lower quality standards; modern cars, however, distinguish themselves through intricate details like stitching and the sound of a door closing [00:15:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### [[impact_of_design_on_business_growth | Quality as a Driver of Growth]]
The notion of "growth versus quality" is a false dichotomy; quality is inherently growth [00:15:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Products that are easier to use and more understandable naturally attract more users and encourage deeper engagement [00:15:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

At Stripe, the growth team is hyper-focused on building better experiences because of its direct correlation with business metrics [00:16:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   **Onboarding Flow**: Improvements in onboarding to make products easier to understand have directly led to increased activations [00:16:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Checkout Experience**: Research revealed that 99% of top e-commerce sites have checkout flow errors that hinder seamless, quicker transactions [00:16:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. By maniacally focusing on improving the quality of the checkout experience, Stripe has seen a **10.5% increase in businesses' revenue** [00:17:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

Stripe powers payment processing for millions of businesses globally, from startups to large enterprises such as Amazon, Hertz, Shopify, Spotify, and X [00:18:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

Designers approach problem-solving by focusing on the emotional experience and how users feel, rather than just optimizing for clicks [00:19:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. This requires multi-disciplinary teams working closely together, where different perspectives act as checks and balances [00:20:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. Great products combine utility, usability, and desirability [00:20:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. Without utility, craft alone is like "Blu-ray or Path" â€“ beautiful but ultimately useless [00:20:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>).

At Stripe, beauty is a key priority even for a B2B financial infrastructure company because it:
1.  **Increases trust**: Meticulous detail signals care and reliability [00:24:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
2.  **Facilitates use**: Leads to better user outcomes and empowers businesses [00:24:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
3.  **Begets beauty**: Encourages users to create beautiful things themselves [00:25:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a> (analogized to the "peeling mushrooms" scene in "The Bear") [00:25:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
4.  **Fosters pride**: Attracts and retains talent who value their craft [00:25:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

## Strategies for Operationalizing Quality

The "gravitational pull is to mediocrity," meaning achieving excellence requires concerted and sustained effort [00:26:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.

### Key Themes for Building Quality
Based on conversations with other design and product leaders, Katie identifies four key themes for operationalizing quality:

1.  **Quality is a Group Effort**: It cannot be delegated to a single person or QA team; it requires organizational-wide commitment [00:29:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Internal standards and communication directly reflect in external product quality [00:29:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
2.  **Vision and Alignment**: Even with talented individuals, subjectivity can lead to disconnected parts. A clear vision and plan (like architectural blueprints for a house) are crucial to ensure all pieces fit together harmoniously [00:30:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.
3.  **Editing and Courage**: Leaders must have the courage to say "no, this isn't good enough" and push for further iteration, even when teams have put in significant effort [00:31:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
4.  **User Perspective**: Truly understanding quality means viewing the product from the user's entire journey, not just isolated features [00:32:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

### "Walk the Store" Program at Stripe
To combat quality regression over time (where new features inadvertently degrade the overall experience) and overcome organizational silos, Stripe implemented the "Walk the Store" program [00:33:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.

*   **Objective**: Increase awareness and accountability among leaders for the quality of user journeys [00:34:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    *   **Identify Critical Journeys**: 15 "critical user journeys" are chosen as key areas that must be high quality [00:34:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
    *   **Assigned Ownership**: Each journey has assigned engineering, product, and design leaders responsible for its quality [00:35:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.
    *   **Regular Walkthroughs**: Leaders "walk the store" on a quarterly cadence, experiencing the product as a user would, starting from an internet search, going through the website, docs, and dashboard [00:35:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
    *   **Friction Logging**: They log friction points, note what's working/not working, and file bugs, reaching out to relevant teams [00:35:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>. This process doesn't replace user research but supplements it with a visceral understanding of pain points [00:35:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.
    *   **Scoring and Calibration**: Journeys are scored qualitatively using a color-based system (e.g., yellow, yellow-green) to avoid fixation on subjective numerical values [00:45:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. Scores are discussed in "Product Quality Review" (PQR) calibration meetings with cross-functional leadership [00:43:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Shared Quality Bar**: Leaders' participation helps cascade the importance of owning journeys and uplevels the shared understanding of the quality bar across the company [00:37:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.
    *   **Upstream Improvements**: Leaders gain insights into bigger opportunities and necessary process changes, like improving SEO alignment with later journey stages [00:37:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
    *   **Cultural Shift**: Engineers and product managers, initially skeptical, become "converts" to the importance of broad quality ownership [00:38:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

### Prioritizing Quality Initiatives
While some companies allocate fixed percentages of time for bug fixes vs. new features, Stripe relies on:
1.  **Hiring Judgment**: Hiring individuals with great judgment and pride in their work [00:47:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
2.  **Leadership Advocacy**: High-level advocacy for quality across the company fuels team planning [00:47:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.
3.  **Demonstrating ROI**: Showing how quality improvements directly lead to better business outcomes (e.g., reducing support calls by making an invoice status clear) reinforces its priority [00:49:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. Every company has examples where quality boosts business metrics, which should be shared widely [00:49:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

### Performance Evaluation and Organizational Culture
*   **Defining Impact**: Performance rubrics should define "impact" broadly, beyond just short-term metric movements, to include long-term, multi-quarter, or multi-year projects that are instrumental to business success [00:50:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>.
*   **Level Ladder System**: Stripe's level ladder system guides expectations for roles, emphasizing the importance of quality [00:52:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Operating Principles**: "Meticulous Craft" is a core operating principle, expected from everyone, from API developers to support staff [00:52:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

## [[building_highfunctioning_design_teams | Building and Scaling Design Teams]]

Katie Dill highlights a formula for team performance: **Performance = Potential - Interference** [00:55:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.
*   **Increase Potential**: This involves hiring excellent talent, developing their skills, and fostering growth [00:55:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>.
*   **Decrease Interference**: Leaders must identify and remove obstacles that hinder great work, which can lead to burnout and reduced success [00:55:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. As companies grow, processes must constantly adapt to new dynamics [00:56:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

### Improving Awareness and Collaboration
To counter the loss of awareness in growing companies, Katie implemented a shared Google Slides deck where designers (and other functions) share screenshots or prototypes of their work every month [00:57:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Visibility**: Designers see what others are working on, fostering collaboration and identifying shared patterns or overlaps [00:58:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.
    *   **Cross-Functional Awareness**: Product managers, engineering leaders, and company leaders gain a holistic view of ongoing projects [00:58:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>.
    *   **Efficiency**: Uncovers redundancies early, saving time and improving overall work quality [01:01:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.
*   **Execution**: Keeping it low-maintenance and easily accessible (e.g., Google Slides over Figma for broader audience access) ensures consistent participation [01:11:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>.

### Addressing Organizational Interference: Colocated Teams
A significant interference pattern observed at both Airbnb and Lyft was the physical and organizational separation of design teams from engineering and product [01:02:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. While this created a "safe space for creative discovery," it led to wasted work, misalignment, and slower iteration cycles as designers worked in isolation from key decision-makers [01:03:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.

The solution involved reorganizing teams to have designers, engineers, and product managers physically sit and work together, fostering shared goals and daily collaboration [01:04:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. This embedded model significantly increased efficiency and clarity, while still maintaining dedicated creative spaces for critique and working sessions for the design function [01:04:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

### Embracing Bold Ideas and Vision Work
There's often a "fear of bold ideas" or a tendency towards incrementalism because large changes are harder to measure and feel riskier [01:07:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>. However, incremental changes rarely make the entire product better [01:08:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

Katie advocates for "Reach for the stars and land on the Moon" [01:09:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>:
*   **Vision Work**: This involves sketching out an "11-star experience" that represents the ideal, comprehensive version of the product or user journey [01:09:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.
*   **Strategic Planning**: This North Star vision then guides the process, allowing for measured, thoughtful risk-taking and breaking down the large vision into actionable, shippable pieces [01:10:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>. This ensures incremental steps contribute to a cohesive and ambitious long-term outcome.

## Hiring Designers
When hiring, prioritize:
1.  **Taste and Character**: It's easier to teach tools and processes than to instill great taste and strong character [01:11:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. Look for natural inclination towards great design [01:11:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.
2.  **Humility**: A humble designer is more open to user feedback, curious about challenges, and collaborative within a team [01:12:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.
3.  **Hustle or Hutzpah**: The courage to propose new ideas, to say "this is not good enough," and to rapidly execute on improvements is essential in creative roles [01:12:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.
For early-stage companies, while a "doer" is needed, it's beneficial to have a senior leader or advisor who brings a user-focused, organizational strategy lens [01:13:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>.

## Final Thoughts
At its core, design is intentionality [01:19:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. It's about thinking deeply about who the product is for and how every decision impacts the user [01:19:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>. While design expertise brings creativity and taste, anyone can bring more care and intentionality to their work, leading to better outcomes [01:20:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>.

A key lesson from learning to fly that applies to leadership is the importance of showing trust [01:31:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. Just as an instructor pulls back to show faith in a student's ability to land a plane, leaders should empower their teams to take on challenges, demonstrating confidence in their capabilities [01:32:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>.

Many people tend to adopt a specific "public speaking voice" when addressing an audience, shifting from their normal conversational tone to a more "professional" version of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This often results in a less authentic and effective delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The goal is to speak conversationally, which is significantly more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Power of Conversational Speaking
Becoming a better speaker is a significant accelerant for one's professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. [[improving_public_speaking_skills | Improving public speaking skills]] is considered a "meta-skill," meaning that as you get better at speaking, your life generally improves across various domains, similar to how improved fitness can enhance overall well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. When breakthroughs are made in speaking, it can positively impact how one feels at work, among friends, with strangers, and even within family relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Humans are naturally evolved to speak; babies learn without formal education, indicating an "incredible hardware" for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Over time, "bugs in the software" (bad habits or anxieties) can develop, leading to avoidance and hindered progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The key is to debug and upgrade this software to unlock one's full speaking potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions and Core Insights
A major misconception about [[improving_public_speaking_skills | public speaking]] is underestimating its transformative potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. If you don't enjoy speaking, you might be "doing it wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Enjoyment can serve as a barometer: if it's not enjoyable, something is likely making it unenjoyable and unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. When individuals feel completely like themselves, communication is highly enjoyable, serving as a means to connect and share thoughts, feeling very empowering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Pressure in business settings, however, often leads people to overthink and try to control words, hindering natural, subconscious communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

Speaking is fundamentally a subconscious, flow-oriented process, not a conscious one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. The best speaking happens when one is not thinking about speaking itself, but is completely attuned to the message being conveyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The goal is to enter and maintain a flow state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This perspective shifts focus from treating symptoms (like filler words) to addressing root causes (like discomfort with slowing down or pausing under pressure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Solving root causes leads to more natural improvements, such as reduced filler words, less racing, and increased mind space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

## Tactical Tips for More Conversational Speaking
Rather than focusing solely on external tactics, effective [[strategies_for_effective_public_speaking_and_reducing_nervousness | public speaking strategies]] delve into root causes and internal shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Three key tactical shifts can immediately improve how one speaks:

### Look Up While Thinking
When gathering thoughts, many people tend to look down, which can appear uncertain or distracted, especially on video calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Instead, try looking up. Looking up makes you appear thoughtful and confident by default, as confident speakers are willing to pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This reduces the likelihood of being interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. To build this habit, write "think up" on a sticky note and place it visibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

### End Strong
People often "end weak" by trailing off or expressing doubts at the conclusion of their statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This is similar to how freestyle rappers' brains "blow up" with self-awareness as they near the end of a flow state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Ending weak can impose a lens of uncertainty on the audience, overshadowing the quality of the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

To end strong, anticipate that self-awareness will increase towards the end of your statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Ensure you "land the plane" by making your ending sound conclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Utilize "summary prompts" like "so to wrap up," "in summary," or "my point here is" to naturally guide your brain to conclude the thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

### Stay in Character
Speakers often self-sabotage by "leaking" their insecurities, such as nervously laughing or expressing doubts like "I don't really know if that makes sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. While speakers intensely feel their internal nervousness, audiences typically cannot perceive it unless it is extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Leaking insecurities forces a filter onto the audience, making them see you as uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

The solution is simple: do not share your insecurities and "stay in character" from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. The cue for yourself can be "stay in it," especially when feeling turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. When you stay in character, audiences respond to you as a confident speaker, which reinforces your own confidence in a positive cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. Many people are nervous in meetings, but you often can't tell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

## Practice Through Play: Public Speaking Games
To [[importance_of_practicing_public_speaking | improve public speaking]], you must actively practice speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. Reading articles or watching videos alone will only go so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. Games are an effective way to practice because they are fun, provide intrinsic rewards, and offer short, deliberate practice reps followed by immediate feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. This rapid feedback loop allows for continuous adjustment and internalization of lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. Games are designed to create "turbulence" to highlight areas for improvement, similar to how a flight simulator trains pilots for difficult scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. This builds resiliency and the ability to recover gracefully from mistakes, leading to confidence in any speaking scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.

[[techniques_for_enhancing_public_speaking_skills | Public speaking games]] expand one's comfort zone, pushing back the "sides of the box" that limit natural communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>.

### Conductor
This game involves speaking on a random topic while adjusting the intensity or energy of your voice to match numbers displayed on a screen (1-10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. A "breathe" prompt requires pausing and relaxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

*   **Benefit:** Tapping into different energy levels creates different emotions, and words naturally follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>. For example, raising energy can bring conviction, while slowing down allows for more introspective thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. It also helps identify whether you are more comfortable with high or low energy speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.
*   **How to Play:** A friend can call out random numbers, or you can even just use hand gestures to change your energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.

### Triple Step
This game is designed for individuals who struggle to maintain a single thought or get easily distracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. The speaker is given a random speech title and then must seamlessly integrate random words or phrases that appear during their speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. The goal is to make the words appear as if they were always part of the speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>.

*   **Benefit:** Builds resiliency and composure under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>. It helps train the brain to stay focused on a clear direction while integrating unexpected elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. It also serves as an excellent warm-up to light up the brain before important meetings, interviews, or podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

## Preparing Talks with Conversational Flow
Traditional talk preparation involves writing extensive notes and scripts, which are then painfully memorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. This linear memorization can lead to getting lost if one point is forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>. A more effective approach prepares talks by speaking, not writing, to foster natural internalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>.

### The Accordion Method
This method helps create extreme clarity and understand the essence of your talk by intentionally "going down the accordion" (reducing time) and then "back up the accordion" (expanding time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:32">[01:26:32]</a>.

*   **Process:**
    1.  Start by getting all ideas out, either by writing them down or speaking them freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>.
    2.  Set a timer for a chosen duration (e.g., 3 minutes) and speak, adhering to the "stay in character" and "end strong" rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. The focus is on getting ideas out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.
    3.  After the first rep, reflect on what worked and didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:15">[01:29:15]</a>.
    4.  Progressively reduce the time constraint (e.g., to 2 minutes, then 1 minute, then 30 seconds), speaking again each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>. This forces you to eliminate noise and non-essential content, leaving only the core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>.
    5.  Once at the shortest duration (e.g., 30 seconds), you'll have a clear sense of your talk's essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:49">[01:29:49]</a>.
    6.  Then, "go back up the accordion" by doubling the time (e.g., from 30 seconds to 1 minute, then 2 minutes, then back to 3 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. At each step, intentionally reintroduce aligned content or new elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>.
*   **Result:** By the end, the talk is not memorized but *internalized*, allowing for natural delivery and adaptability across different time frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>. It provides a deep sense of the speech's core, making mistakes less impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. This method can be used for entire talks (macro level) or specific sections where clarity is needed (micro level) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>.

### The Bow and Arrow Technique
This technique shifts the focus from "what we want to say" to "what we want our audience to remember" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>. Typically, audiences remember only one key takeaway from a talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>.

*   **Arrow (The One Thing):** This is your core message, a single sentence that your audience should remember above all else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:22">[01:39:22]</a>. This "North star" provides clarity for both the speaker and the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.
*   **Bow (The Support):** To give the "arrow" impact, you need to "pull the bow back" by adding weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:59">[01:39:59]</a>. This involves incorporating interesting anecdotes, relevant data points, or emotional stories that support and illustrate your one thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>.
*   **Application:** The process of defining your arrow and bow is often iterative, with one informing the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:33">[01:40:33]</a>. When preparing a talk, you might write a tentative arrow, then consider supporting elements, and refine both through practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:46">[01:40:46]</a>. For presentations with slides, each slide should also have its "one thing" in the title, ensuring every element is intentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:26">[01:42:26]</a>.

## Trusting Your Natural Ability
A common concern is that these methods encourage "bullshitting" or talking without substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. However, if the thought of being a "bullshitter" even crosses your mind, you likely have a keen skill set for discerning genuine communication and will naturally avoid it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>. The goal is to match high-level communication skills with strong ideas, allowing for natural, free expression while maintaining an internal compass to stay true to your message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>.

Speaking is a high-performance skill, and embracing the journey of [[improving public speaking skills | improving]] it can be addictive and energizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>. The fear often lies in thinking about doing the exercise, but once you begin, it becomes empowering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>. The more constrained one feels with their speaking, the more transformational the journey to conversational speaking will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:13">[01:44:13]</a>.

At Notion, co-founder and CEO Ivan Zhao emphasizes the critical role of [[operationalizing_the_principle_of_meticulousness_in_product_development | craft and values]] in guiding product development and building a lasting company. This philosophy underpins everything from product design to [[role_of_company_culture_in_product_management | company culture]] and strategic decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.

## Defining Craft

Craft, in this context, is described as applying one's personal values to technical know-how to create clever tradeoffs and build something new and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. Zhao likens his approach to that of a wood cabinet builder, constantly asking how to make something "more beautiful and more useful and feels nicer on your hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. This perspective encourages a meticulous attention to detail and a commitment to [[balancing_speed_and_quality_in_product_development | quality]] that transcends typical tech cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.

### Craft in Action: The Notion Office
The physical environment of Notion's office reflects this emphasis on craft and meticulousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>:
*   **Cozy Vibe** The office is designed to feel pleasant and comfortable, like an artist's studio or home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Lighting and Colors** Efforts were made to avoid harsh hospital-like overhead lighting, opting for warm, cream-colored walls over pale white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.
*   **Furniture** Most office furniture resembles home furnishings to create a cozy feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   **No Shoes Rule** For a long time, a "no shoes" rule contributed to the home-like atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.
*   **Conference Room Names** Conference rooms are named after "timeless tools" in history, such as the iPhone, Macintosh, Lamy 2000 pens, and Toshiba rice cookers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. These tools, which have shaped people's lives and lasted for decades, serve as inspirations for creating software products with similar longevity and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.

## The Role of Values

Building for your values means creating something authentic to oneself that also happens to be useful for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. This approach provides a "durable energy source" during challenging times, such as Notion's "lost years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Zhao believes that it is essential to shape tools in a way that extends the "good part of human nature," such as creativity and beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>.

### Balancing Vision and Market Needs
While it's important to build from a place of personal value, Zhao emphasizes the necessity of [[the_importance_of_good_product_decisions_and_taste | balancing this vision with market needs]]:
*   **Avoiding an "Art Project"** If a product is built too much for personal value without considering users, it risks becoming an "art project" or research project with no users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.
*   **Avoiding a "Commodity"** Conversely, building too much purely for business can result in a generic, undifferentiated "commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **"Sugar and Broccoli" Approach** Notion learned to "hide their vision" (allowing everyone to create software) within a format people already cared about: productivity software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. As Zhao describes it, "people don't want to eat the broccoli, but people like sugar, so give them the sugar that hides your broccoli inside of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### The Impact of Value Alignment
When a company prioritizes optimizing for competition and revenue over its core values, it can lead to "organ rejection" with employees and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. This was evident when Notion shipped features that deviated from their "Lego for software" vision:
*   **Sprint Feature Misstep** An example was the attempt to hardcode a Sprint product management feature, rather than building it with Notion's core "Lego pieces" (modular components) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.
*   **User and Technical Feedback** This hardcoded approach felt "underpowered" to customers compared to competitors and created technical challenges within Notion's codebase, leading to a realization that they had strayed from their values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>. The team subsequently returned to the original Lego-like approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.

## Crafting a Lean and High-Quality Product

Notion's commitment to [[balancing_speed_and_quality_in_product_development | craft and values]] has also influenced its operational philosophy, focusing on efficiency and quality over rapid expansion:
*   **Talent Density** The company prioritizes "talent density" over sheer headcount, measuring revenue per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
*   **Small Teams** By maintaining small teams, Notion minimizes internal communication overhead and allows for quicker alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
*   **System Over People** Zhao believes that "better system is much better than [progress through] people," using Notion itself as a meta-tool to run the company and reduce reliance on large teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **"Small Bus" Metaphor** Internally, the company uses the metaphor of a "small bus" where it's easier to turn corners, accelerate, and maneuver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. This reinforces the idea that picking the right, talented "seatmates" dictates the speed and experience of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

This focus on craft and values has allowed Notion to build a beloved and popular product that continues to grow while staying true to its founding principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Jessica Lax, Vice President of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, emphasizes that analytics should function as a business impact-driving entity, not merely a service. This means addressing not just "why" something is happening, but "what do we do now that we know this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Jessica's expertise lies in defining metrics that align incentives and drive desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:40">[01:23:40]</a>.

## Structuring Data Teams for Impact

Jessica advocates for a centralized data organization model, or a "Center of Excellence," over embedding analytics within individual business units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. While analytical teams at DoorDash are divided into "pods" that align with product, engineering, operations, and marketing, their reporting structure remains central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This ensures the analytics team shares the same goals as their partner teams, aligning incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

The benefits of a centralized data organization include:
*   **Consistent and High Talent Bar**: Ensures a uniform standard for technical and soft skills during hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Growth Opportunities**: Provides diverse career paths for data professionals across different business areas, aiding in talent retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Consistency of Methodologies and Metrics**: Prevents different teams from defining the same metrics differently, ensuring consistency and enabling improvement through collective input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: Helps identify and address common problems across teams, allowing for automation and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Strong Team Culture**: Fosters a unique culture of learning and sharing, where team members can support each other and build camaraderie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## [[Importance of product metrics and how to choose them | Choosing Effective Metrics]]

Jessica highlights several key principles for selecting impactful metrics:

### Short-Term Drivers for Long-Term Outputs
Ultimately, the goal is to find a short-term, measurable metric that drives a long-term output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. For example, "retention is a terrible thing to goal on" in the short term because it's difficult to influence meaningfully quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. Instead, identify and test "proxy metrics" or inputs that are known to drive retention through experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.

### Simplicity Over Perfection
Avoid complex "composite metrics" with weighted coefficients that are difficult for people to understand or intuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.
> "Pick something simple, even if it's not perfect and your composite would be more perfect. If people understand it, if they have an intuition around it, if it's something that people can talk about across the company, it's going to be a much better metric in terms of driving real outcomes." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>

An example of a complex, ineffective metric was a "Merchant Health score" that combined multiple factors with weights, making it hard to interpret or act upon. It was more effective to focus on simpler, actionable inputs like merchant photo coverage or accurate open hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

### [[Balancing Customer Focus and Business Metrics | Common Currency for Trade-offs]]
It's crucial to understand how different metrics across the company relate to one another and quantify them in a common currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. At DoorDash, this often means translating initiatives into their impact on gross order value (GOV) and volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>. This allows for informed trade-offs across diverse teams, such as comparing the impact of lowering prices versus improving delivery times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This approach helps in making faster and better decisions by providing an "inventory of things that we can do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.

Examples of metrics translated into GOV/Volume include:
*   Improvements in the login flow leading to more consumers placing orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.
*   Selling a specific type of restaurant in a city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.
*   Mobilizing more Dashers affecting quality metrics like delivery times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.
*   [[Onboarding and activation metrics in tech | Onboarding]] more Dashers or signing more restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.

### Addressing Edge Cases and Fail States
Beyond averages, it is critically important to examine and set goals around "edge cases" and "fail states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>. For example, DoorDash focuses on "never delivered" orders, which, though rare, represent "terrible experiences for consumers" leading to churn and significant costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>. Focusing on these extreme negative experiences, even if they're a tiny fraction, can have a profound impact on customer satisfaction, brand perception, and long-term profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>.

Another key consideration is identifying "what data don't we have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. For instance, login errors mean affected users never enter the data system, making the problem invisible if only looking at logged-in user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

## [[Building Strategy Skills and Effective Goals | Goal Setting and Prioritization]]

### Strategic Prioritization and Trade-offs
Data teams should align their goals with those of their business partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. When new requests come in, it's essential to communicate the trade-offs openly:
> "Always share the tradeoffs. Don't kind of suffer in silence with how am I going to do all four of these things. Bring it up and say, 'Hey, this is what I was planning to do. If you want me to do this extra new thing, then one of these other things is going to have to drop.'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>

This transparent conversation ensures that the team is always working on the most impactful initiatives, with the full understanding and agreement of business partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

### Fostering Proactive Exploration
To ensure data teams proactively identify opportunities rather than just answering questions, it's crucial to be intentional about carving out time for exploratory work and deep dives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Setting specific goals for self-directed insight generation helps hold the team accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Hackathons, for example, can be an effective way to dedicate time to investigating interesting problems and finding new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

An example from DoorDash's hackathon involved analyzing referral channels. Initial data suggested it was below average, but a deep dive revealed a bimodal distribution: a segment of high-quality referrals was masked by widespread fraudulent behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. This led to significant recommendations for fraud checks and referral caps, optimizing the channel's efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

## Culture of Extreme Ownership

A key cultural aspect at DoorDash is "extreme ownership" of outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>. Data scientists are expected to go beyond their typical responsibilities to solve problems, even if it means picking up the phone to call customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. This approach encourages team members to engage in product management or engineering work when needed, contributing to a versatile and engaged team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from "Bad Metrics"

Experience has shown that some metrics are more problematic than others:
*   **Overly Complex Metrics**: As mentioned, composite scores that aggregate many factors can become meaningless if no one understands their composition or how to influence them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.
*   **Inefficient Metric Rotation**: Constantly switching the primary metric a team focuses on can be inefficient. Teams develop deep expertise in moving a specific lever, and forcing them to switch frequently leads to a new learning curve and reduced efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. It's often better to let a team focus on one metric until opportunities are exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>.

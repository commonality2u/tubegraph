Kunal Shah, a prominent entrepreneur and product leader in India and globally, offers profound insights into [[Building and evolving a software product|building and evolving software products]], especially within diverse markets like India. His perspectives are shaped by his background in philosophy and extensive experience as the CEO and founder of Cred, a fintech startup valued at over $6 billion, which processes a significant portion of India's credit card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## The Delta 4 Framework for Product Success

Kunal Shah developed the "Delta 4 framework" to provide a measurable way to assess product improvement, contrasting it with the often unquantifiable "10x better" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

The framework states that for a product to be successful, its efficiency must be at least four points higher (on a 1-10 scale) than the existing solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. When a product achieves a Delta 4 or higher, three key outcomes emerge:
1.  **Irreversibility**: Users will find it difficult to go back to the old way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
2.  **High Tolerance for Failure**: Users will tolerate minor failures because the overall efficiency gain is so significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
3.  **Unique Brag-Worthy Proposition (UBP)**: Users will enthusiastically talk about and share the product, leading to natural, low-cost or zero-cost acquisition and [[Communityled growth and productled growth|community-led growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

For instance, comparing Uber (efficiency score of 9) to an old cab system (efficiency score of 3) yields a Delta of 6, making Uber a highly successful product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Conversely, trying to buy a suit online might offer low efficiency, as the fit is often poor, making the offline experience still preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. This framework can be applied to features, products, or entire businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Indian Market Landscape

[[Customercentric product development|Building user-centric products]] in India requires a deep understanding of its unique market dynamics, which differ significantly from Western markets.

### DAUs vs. ARPUs Paradox
India is characterized by easily attainable Daily Active Users (DAUs) but low Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This is primarily due to:
*   **Low Per Capita Income**: The average income in India is around $2,500 per year, making high monetization per user challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Cheap Data and High Smartphone Penetration**: India offers affordable data and widespread smartphone use, attracting global companies seeking large user bases for public market valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Free Content Abundance**: Users are accustomed to free content and data, making paid subscriptions difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Netflix is an example of a company that gained many users but struggled with monetization in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### The Value of Time and Efficiency
In India, the concept of the "value of time" differs significantly from Western markets. Most Indians have never been paid an hourly salary, making it difficult for them to quantify their time in monetary terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This affects pricing strategies, as people might spend an hour to save $10 on a flight ticket, a behavior often observed even among Indians in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Additionally, many Indian languages lack a direct word for "efficiency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

### The Role of Trust and Super Apps
India, as a developing nation, is largely a "low-trust market" where institutions protecting consumers from bad company behavior are not as strong as in developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This scarcity of trust leads to a "concentration of trust," where "super apps" and "super companies" thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Brands like Tata, which offer a wide range of products from salt to cars, gain immense consumer confidence due to this trust dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Unlike in the US where focus is often advised for startups, in India, a broader approach that offers multiple services within one trusted entity is more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Cred's Approach to Market Segmentation

Cred recognized that value (time and per capita income) is concentrated in approximately 25 million families in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. These families are more global in their outlook compared to the rest of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This insight led Cred to focus specifically on this customer segment, defying investor expectations to become "the next China" by targeting a broader, less lucrative demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This [[Segmentation and productizing for different customer needs|strategic segmentation]] allowed them to secure funding and build a product tailored to a receptive audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities in India

India presents both challenges and vast opportunities for startups:
*   **Female Labor Participation**: A low female labor participation rate is a challenge but also an opportunity for AI-driven businesses that support remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **AI and Efficiency**: AI can significantly boost per capita income by enhancing human intelligence, not replacing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. However, the rapid reduction of "inefficiency" (which is the world's largest employer) could lead to joblessness if not managed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Youthful Demographics**: India has a young, well-positioned demographic with access to technology and ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. However, it's the first generation truly embracing entrepreneurship and risk, leading to inevitable large-scale failures and a need for societal adaptation to layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Investor Perception**: Indian internet companies are relatively new to proving large-scale profitability, unlike their Western counterparts, which often leads to public scrutiny about losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## Insights for Product Building Globally

*   **Founder's Evolution**: The skills required for 0-1 (creation) are different from those for 10-100 (scaling), requiring founders to continuously evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Founders act as "uncertainty absorbers" for employees, investors, and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Profit Pools Reflect Values**: A country's profit pools reveal its underlying values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Copying another country's profit pool structure might not be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. For example, patriarchal societies often have significant market caps in financial services rather than consumption, and female fashion spend is typically lower than men's in India due to societal factors like low divorce rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Cultural Archetypes**: Indian CEOs in the US often succeed because they "follow the Dharma of the founders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This humility in sustaining and growing the original vision, rather than changing it for personal identity, aligns with the Indian mythological archetypes of Vishnu (sustenance), Rama (high values, high obedience), and Krishna (high values, low obedience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This long-term, value-driven mindset is a hallmark of many Indian cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Curiosity

Curiosity is vital for continuous growth and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. A curious person is not afraid to demonstrate lack of expertise and embraces problems they don't know how to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. This security in asking "dumb questions" and constant learning prevents stagnation and allows for adaptation to environmental changes, much like long-lasting species that can reduce their metabolism, have high conversion rates for resources, and adapt to changing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Curiosity leads to information asymmetry, which is the foundation of wealth and competitive advantage for successful companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

Asking "why" questions, particularly about historical events or the origins of everyday objects, helps develop "second-order thinking"—the ability to predict the ripple effects of an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

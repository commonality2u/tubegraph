Vikrant Bhargava, Head of Product at Gojek, a company known for building strong product and [[importance_of_design_and_functionality_in_product_development | design]] talent, emphasizes the critical role of execution and tangible outputs in a [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product manager's]] career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. He is among the most well-known product leaders in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## Vikrant's Career Growth Framework for Product Managers

Bhargava developed a career growth framework for [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product managers]] based on three "Ws": What you produce, what you bring to the table, and what your operating model is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Strong [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product managers]] usually excel in two or three of these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### What You Produce (Outputs vs. Outcomes)

Many [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product managers]] initially focus on [[impact_in_product_management | impact]], goals, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. However, the first thing anyone produces, especially when starting out, is outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

*   **Outputs** can include launching a product, analyzing and running experiments, or contributing to a go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. They are tangibly defined and allow for quick action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Outcomes** relate to owning product areas or goals, or collaborating on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This then leads to leadership and directional responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

A common mistake is abandoning focus on outputs when transitioning to outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Even at senior levels, it's crucial to maintain your "IC (Individual Contributor) roots" and be willing to "pull up your sleeves and go back and keep working on those things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

#### Focus on Outputs Early in Career
For those starting their careers, Bhargava advises focusing on "just getting stuff out and done" rather than obsessing over [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This means shipping products, analyzing experiments, or even assisting with small tasks like ranking content sources for a homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The goal is to "be useful" by making your team more effective and helping the company succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

At early stages, the focus is on execution; people want you to "get stuff done" rather than defining long-term strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. This focus on smooth execution and shipping things on time is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### What You Bring to the Table (Impact on Impact)

This aspect focuses on a [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product manager's]] "[[impact_in_product_management | impact]] on [[impact_in_product_management | impact]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. It's not enough for your product area to be successful; you must demonstrate your contribution to that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

#### Quality of Product Artifacts
This is exemplified by the quality of product artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>:
*   Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>
*   Draft notes for care or marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>
*   Product strategy documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>
*   Briefs for [[importance_of_design_and_functionality_in_product_development | design]] teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>
*   Well-structured Jira storyboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>

The quality of these artifacts reflects your proficiency in four pillars: data and metrics, [[importance_of_design_and_functionality_in_product_development | design]] and research, technology skills, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Strong [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product managers]] don't just produce these; they ensure they are deep, channelize questions into strategic choices, and shape discussions and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. The goal is to cultivate an aura of competence where others trust you to "get this" and ensure it's "done well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

### What Your Operating Model Is (Communication and Collaboration)
This is crucial for growth, especially for mid-senior to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. It encompasses [[the_importance_of_communication_in_product_management | communication]], collaboration, organizational skills, and community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

Three key tenets for [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product managers]] to work well with others:
1.  Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
2.  Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
3.  Be able to get decisions made without having to make all the decisions yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

To successfully push back on ideas, Bhargava suggests bringing the conversation to a more logical space from an emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. Avoid being seen as an obstacle; instead, add value and advance the product's direction and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

## Impediments to Career Growth

Vikrant identifies three mindset shifts that can hinder career progression:
1.  **Focusing on things you cannot control:** As [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product managers]] become more senior, they often shift their focus from personal learning and growth to external factors like organizational strategy or other stakeholders' actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. It's vital to focus on what is within your control, such as your output, artifacts, and operating model across data, technology, [[the_importance_of_communication_in_product_management | communication]], collaboration, [[importance_of_design_and_functionality_in_product_development | design]], research, strategy, and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
2.  **Your relationship with change:** Early in a career, the rate of skill acquisition and growth is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. However, at mid-senior levels, [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product managers]] may become hesitant to take on new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. To counter this, continuously benchmark yourself against the best in the industry or in other functions to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.
3.  **How you see yourself:** Self-told stories, such as being a "high agency PM" or a "hyper-collaborative PM," can inadvertently create anti-signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. For example, a "high agency PM" might excuse being brash, while a "hyper-collaborative PM" might excuse indecisiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. Identifying and correcting these self-limiting stories is crucial for getting back on a growth path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

## Developing Key Skills for Product Managers

When seeking to improve, it's impossible to improve on every area simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. Instead, identify the area that offers "maximum leverage" for your growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. If you're struggling in a particular area, fix that first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.

Bhargava recommends that early in a career, [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product managers]] should pick one skill from data or tech, and one from [[importance_of_design_and_functionality_in_product_development | design]] and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. This approach provides maximum leverage by developing skills you might not have naturally acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.

He outlines key attributes and skill sets for a [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product manager]] across different levels:
*   **Data:** From not being able to define basic metrics (level 0) to "Ninja level data quality" (level 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **[[importance_of_design_and_functionality_in_product_development | Design]] and Research:** From identifying user problems (level 0) to tying them to business goals (level 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
*   **Technology:** From no understanding of basic concepts like HTTP or API (level 0) to being able to write technology design documents (level 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** From relying on others for direction (level 0) to articulating a coherent product strategy at a broad level (level 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>.
*   **[[the_importance_of_communication_in_product_management | Communication]] and Collaboration:** Continual lifelong learning, as there will always be new contexts and cultures to adapt to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Organizational Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>
*   **Community Skills:** The [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product manager]] acts as a "community enabler" in the team and organization, tying everyone together towards a common mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

## The Ambiguity of the Product Manager Role

The [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product management]] role is often ambiguous, with definitions varying across companies and even within different teams of a large organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. When stakeholders ask what a [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product manager]] is expected to do, Bhargava's general answer is: if something is blocking product progress, the [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product manager]] should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.

He views [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product management]] as both an art and a science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. Rather than focusing on a precise definition, [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product managers]] should focus on their contributions and outputs across the key axes of data, [[importance_of_design_and_functionality_in_product_development | design]], technology, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. The [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product manager]] is the unique discipline that "encircles" and co-collaborates with all other disciplines, gaining unique [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. It's about playing a **role**, not just having a **title** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

## Contrarian Views

Vikrant holds two views that he considers somewhat contrarian:
1.  **Intent is not enough:** While good intentions are a starting point, they are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>. Your actions, behavior, [[the_importance_of_communication_in_product_management | communication]], and collaboration must also clearly demonstrate who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.
2.  **The importance of effort and hours:** He believes it's become "politically incorrect" to state that putting in significant effort and hours is necessary for growth and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. He maintains that spending time, effort, and energy on personal growth is fundamental, regardless of company growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>. This stands in contrast to debates around complete workaholism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

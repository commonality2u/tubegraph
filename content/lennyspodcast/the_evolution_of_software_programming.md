The field of software programming is undergoing a profound transformation, moving towards a "world after code" where the emphasis shifts from writing explicit code to specifying intent and designing logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Michael Tru, co-founder and CEO of Any Sphere (the company behind Cursor), believes this change will make being an engineer feel more like being a logic designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The "After Code" Vision

The goal with Cursor is to [[The future of AI in software development | invent a new type of programming]], a very different way to build software that distills the process down to describing intent to the computer in the most concise way possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This future involves engineers defining how they want software to work and look, leveraging maturing technology to achieve a "legions higher level" and more productive method of building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This will be a gradual shift away from traditional software building methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Michael Tru contrasts this vision with two common but, in his view, problematic perspectives:
1.  **Status Quo**: The belief that software building will remain largely the same, involving text editing in formal programming languages like TypeScript, Go, C, and Rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
2.  **Chatbot-driven Automation**: The idea that engineers will simply type commands into a bot to build and modify software, akin to a chatbot or Slackbot interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Tru argues this lacks the precision needed for humans to have complete control over software appearance and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Instead, the future is envisioned as a world where the logic of software is represented in a more human-readable form, like an evolution of programming language towards pseudocode or doctrine form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This "after code" world means moving away from impenetrable millions of lines of code to something terser and easier to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The human remains in the driver's seat, maintaining control and the ability to make rapid changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Evolving Skills for Engineers and Product Teams

In this evolving landscape, [[Skills for the Evolving Engineering Landscape | certain skills will become more valuable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>:
*   **Taste**: Increasingly important, extending beyond visual UI/UX to the logic and functionality of the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. It's about having the right idea for what should be built and the effortless translation of that intent into a functional product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Logic Design**: Engineers will primarily focus on specifying their intent for how everything should work, shifting from the "how" (implementation details) to the "what" (desired outcome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

Conversely, the skill of **carefulness** as a software engineer will become less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. While current [[Role of AI in Software Development | AI tools]] can lead to deficiencies if fully trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, the future aims for systems where engineers can be less meticulous.

### Vibe Coding and Its Limitations
"Vibe coding" describes a state of creation where a lot of code is generated without fully understanding the underlying details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Currently, this approach leads to limitations, as a lack of detailed understanding can prevent future changes to large enough projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. The challenge is to provide continued control over details even when the user doesn't understand the generated code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## The Journey of Cursor and the Role of AI

Cursor's origin stemmed from a reflection on how [[AI interfaces and future trends in software development | AI would improve over the next decade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Inspiration**: The first beta version of GitHub Copilot was a highly useful [[Role of AI in enhancing and transforming software development | AI product]] that demonstrated the potential for significant advancements in development tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. OpenAI's scaling papers also indicated that AI would continuously improve through simple levers like model and data scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Initial Misstep**: The team initially focused on automating mechanical engineering, believing it to be an "uncompetitive and sleepy" area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. This proved challenging due to a lack of domain expertise and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **Pivot to Programming**: Realizing a lack of ambition in the existing programming tool space, the team pivoted to building Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This demonstrated that a perceived crowded market can still offer massive opportunities if there's a vision for "leapfrogs" and a high ceiling for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### The Decision to Build an IDE
Cursor chose the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) path over simple plugins or full AI agentic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Human Control**: A core philosophy is giving humans complete control over software decisions, moving away from full end-to-end automation by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
*   **Realism**: Acknowledging the current limitations of [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development_and_deployment | AI models]], the team's dogfooding process reinforced the need for humans to be in the driver's seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
*   **Extensibility**: The belief that the act of programming and its form factor will change drastically necessitates control over the entire application, which existing coding environments lack in extensibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.

### The "Ensemble of Models" Approach
A counterintuitive learning for Cursor was the necessity of doing their own model development, despite initially planning to rely solely on existing foundation models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Every "magic moment" in Cursor now involves a custom model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

The technical stack utilizes an "ensemble of models":
*   **Foundation Models (e.g., GPT, Sonnet, Gemini)**: Used for general understanding and high-level thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
*   **Custom Models**: Developed in-house for specific tasks where foundation models are insufficient due to cost, speed, or specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
    *   **Autocomplete**: A core feature that predicts the next actions across multiple files, requiring very fast (under 300ms) and cost-effective models trained for "diffs" (changes in a codebase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
    *   **Input Models**: Act as a "mini Google search" to find relevant parts of a codebase to show to large foundation models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.
    *   **Output Models**: Take high-level change "sketches" from large models and fill in the full code details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.
    *   These custom models often start from the best pre-trained open-source models, sometimes collaborating with closed-source providers for tuning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

This multi-model approach is crucial for product quality and speed, focusing on complementing the weaknesses of general foundation models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.

## The Future Market and AI Engineers

### Market Dynamics and Defensibility
The market for AI-powered software development tools is incredibly large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. Unlike past IDE markets that were fragmented and offered limited monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>, [[AI interfaces and future trends in software development | AI allows for deeper and wider solutions]] for knowledge workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

In this space, defensibility doesn't come from traditional lock-in but from continuous innovation and being the best product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. Michael Tru compares it to early search engines or personal computing, where the "ceiling is incredibly high" for useful innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. This requires an ongoing engine of R&D and responsiveness to user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.

While there will be many different solutions, Tru predicts one company will eventually build the "general tool" for almost all the world's software, becoming a generationally significant business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. He notes that Microsoft's Copilot, despite its early inspiration and strong distribution, may be falling behind due to structural reasons (a market not friendly to incumbents who can't innovate quickly) and historical reasons (team changes and coordination challenges) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

### Managing "AI Engineers"
The rise of AI in development means human engineers will increasingly act like engineering managers, overseeing AI "reports" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
*   **Current Best Practice**: Instead of giving the AI a large task in one go, the most successful users "chop things up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. This involves frequent, smaller specifications and reviews, akin to autocomplete, which maintains human control and a fast iteration loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
*   **Future Integration**: Tools like Cursor will enable seamless movement between background AI processes (like Slack-based agents for specific tasks like bug fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>) and foreground interactive work, allowing engineers to pull in AI's work and quickly iterate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

### Impact on Junior vs. Senior Engineers
Both junior and senior engineers benefit significantly from AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Junior Engineers**: Tend to over-rely on AI wholesale, which is not yet feasible for complex professional work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.
*   **Senior Engineers**: On average, underrate AI's capabilities and stick to existing workflows, though some "boundary pushing" senior developers on internal developer experience teams are strong adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

The key for users is to develop a "taste" for what models can do, including their complexity limits and how much specification they require <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. This often means experimenting in safe environments to understand AI's full capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

## Misunderstandings and the Long-Term Outlook

Michael Tru believes people still misunderstand the nature of AI's impact, often falling into extremes of either overestimating the speed of change or dismissing it as hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.
*   **Consequential but Gradual**: AI represents a technology shift more consequential than the internet or even the advent of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. However, it will be a multi-decade transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.
*   **Independent Problems**: Progress requires knocking down many independent problems, from improving models (faster, cheaper, smarter, acting in the real world) to designing the human-computer interaction experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Value of Integrated Companies**: Companies that build both the underlying technology (integrating best parts from providers, sometimes in-house development) and the product experience for a specific area of knowledge work will be highly consequential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.

The demand for software and engineers will continue to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>. If the cost and labor intensity of building software can be reduced by orders of magnitude, there will be "tons and tons and tons" more applications and tools created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>. The physics of working on computers are so great that there should be much less friction in creating and manipulating software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.

The [[The evolution and future of product management | evolution and growth of Windsurf as an AI coding tool]] like Cursor underscores the need for teams that can continuously invent new things and improve existing ones, adapting to constant "leapfrogs" in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. This continuous innovation, combined with a deep understanding of historical technological shifts, is key to success in this rapidly evolving domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.

Shas Doshi, in a live recording at the Lean Product and Product Leader Summit, discussed questions he wished he had asked himself earlier in his career as a product leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. He noted that his career was "full of suffering" but expressed zero complaints, highlighting that a lot of challenges stemmed from not being honest with himself about answers to critical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Why Am I So Busy?

A persistent [[Common problems faced by product teams | problem]] for many product leaders, including Shas Doshi for 16-17 years of his 20-year product career, is feeling constantly stressed and busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This leads to dissatisfaction and even physical ailments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### The Problem of Overwhelming Scope
While many product leaders are familiar with productivity tips (e.g., to-do lists, calendar management, frameworks like LNO), these often prove insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. As product leaders advance, their scope grows to a point where no amount of efficiency or prioritization can prevent them from being overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Inefficient Planning Processes
Annual planning is a significant contributor to this busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. These periods can stretch for two to three months, filled with spreadsheets, meetings, managing dependencies, and stakeholder engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Often, the resulting plans are forgotten within weeks of the new year, as unexpected customer escalations or new requirements necessitate revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The common adage, "Plans are useless, but planning is everything," often justifies this unproductive cycle, even though its meaning is unclear to most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### Poor Product Decisions
A core reason for persistent busyness is making suboptimal product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Many teams rush decisions, often citing concepts like "two-way doors" (reversible decisions) without thoroughly considering customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Decisions are sometimes made simply because an engineer is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

This leads to:
*   Committing to features that take significant time to build and ramp up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
*   Features lacking adoption, leading to awkward QBRs where leaders resort to "favorable anecdotes" instead of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
*   Sales counterparts revealing the feature isn't winning deals, leading to calls for "full-featured" additions or "table stakes" requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   Signing up for more work on features that should not have been built in the first place, accumulating "debt" and increasing busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

### Solution: Real Product Strategy
The solution to excessive busyness, particularly concerning planning, is to develop a real product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   At Stripe, Shas Doshi found that having a genuinely aligned product strategy for a major product allowed him to complete planning in just three days, unlike the four to six weeks typically spent by peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   A clear product strategy eliminates many prioritization problems and provides a rigorous framework for handling sales or support escalations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   It helps product leaders to pause for "2 minutes or two days or two weeks" before making decisions, recognizing that most "two-way doors" at their level are actually "one-way doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
*   [[Executing strategy effectively in product management | Thinking is cheap]], so product leaders should prioritize thorough thinking before action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

## Do I Actually Have Good Taste?

Shas Doshi realized he needed to ask himself if he truly had good taste, not just in product aesthetics, but in the underlying beliefs that dictate leadership and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.

### The Misguided Focus on Execution
Early in his career at Google, Shas Doshi was in an environment where strategy was dismissed as "for MBAs," with the emphasis placed solely on execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This belief, while seemingly valid given Google's success, led him to downplay the importance of strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

It was only after joining Twitter post-IPO, and observing the company's struggle despite incredible assets (product, network effects, brand, talent), that he recognized Twitter's biggest [[Challenges and signs of weak product positioning | problem]] was a lack of a real, compelling, cohesive product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. This experience, and later at Stripe, solidified the critical importance of a clear strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

### Defining "Taste" in Product Leadership
"Taste" for product leaders extends beyond pixels and user experience; it's about the ability to identify what is truly good *without* needing to see its results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. It's about recognizing "game before the game is called" or "in the practice session" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

Product leaders can often fall into traps that indicate poor "taste" in judgment:
*   Overly excited about catchy metaphors (e.g., "two-way door" vs. "reversible decisions") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   Impressed by alliterations (e.g., "fail fast" vs. "fail quickly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   Impressed by complicated charts and math they don't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.
*   Becoming "stuff graders" who dislike everything, which requires "zero taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.

### Solution: Shedding Biases
To develop better taste, product leaders must become more critical thinkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>. This involves shedding patterns built over time and evaluating ideas separately from their social proof, authority bias, or other external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.

## Why Does My Job Feel So Frustrating?

Despite loving the macro aspect of product leadership, Shas Doshi experienced daily frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.

### Loneliness and Misalignment
The product leader's job is inherently lonely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. Frustration arises when leaders consistently operate in misalignment with their "superpowers" and true core identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

Product work can be categorized into three levels:
1.  **Impact:** The core value creation.
2.  **Execution:** The process of building and shipping.
3.  **Optics:** Managing perceptions, corporate politics, and external expectations.

If a product leader's "happy place" (e.g., Impact or Execution) is not where they spend most of their time, and they are forced into "Optics" work, it leads to frustration because willpower is finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. As one climbs the corporate ladder, the proportion of time spent on Optics often increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.

### Solution: Operating in Alignment with Superpowers
The solution is to abandon traditional career paths that prioritize hierarchy or external expectations (e.g., "what will people say on LinkedIn") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   Shas Doshi, for example, chose to move back to an earlier-stage product at Stripe when his team's "fan out" reached about 50 people, because that size typically required more Optics work than he preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.
*   Product leaders should identify their "superpowers" and operate their careers in accordance with them, making decisions based on self-truth rather than envy or societal expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. This leads to better work, job satisfaction, and reduced frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

## Am I Really Listening?

The final question Shas Doshi wished he asked himself sooner is about the quality of his listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. He initially believed he was a good listener, capable of recapping and making eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. However, he realized there is "an entirely other level to listening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. This deeper level of listening is what enables a product leader to become world-class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. For resources on this deeper form of listening, he recommends exploring the works of Rick Rubin, Dee Hock, and Peter Drucker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

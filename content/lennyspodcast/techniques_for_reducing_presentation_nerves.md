Public speaking can be associated with extreme nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. This fear is often linked to a "fight or flight instinct," where the body and mind perceive stepping onto a stage as a threat, similar to being attacked by an animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>. However, individuals who are more thoughtful and contemplative about speaking often develop better content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. Those who identify as nervous presenters may possess valuable and deeply considered content that should be shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.

[[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | Overcoming public speaking anxiety]] and [[strategies_for_public_speaking_and_reducing_stage_fright | reducing stage fright]] primarily involves managing this internal "battle" to get oneself on stage and deliver the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.

## Visualization and Mindset

*   **Change Your Visual Model**: To reduce nerves, sit in an auditorium seat, look at the stage, and visualize yourself on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. While on stage, imagine friendly, smiling faces in the audience, actively replacing any mental image of scowling or judging faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>. These negative perceptions are typically only in the speaker's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. This is a key [[visualization_techniques_for_public_speaking | visualization technique for public speaking]] to shift your mindset.

## Pre-Talk Rituals

Public speakers often have specific pre-talk rituals to prepare for their presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>:

*   **Calming Techniques**: Some speakers, especially those with naturally high energy, find calm by finding a dark, quiet corner backstage to sit and focus on breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. Deep breathing patterns, such as taking a deep breath, followed by another gulp of breath, and then slowly releasing it, can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
*   **Chemical Shift**: Watching funny videos or other content that induces laughter can chemically shift the body from a state of nervousness to laughter, which helps reset the speaker before going on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>.
*   **Energy Management**: While some speakers energize themselves with loud music or physical activity like skipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>, it is important to understand what your body needs. Pumping oneself up too much can sometimes lead to uncontrolled breathing, which might be mistaken for anxiety by an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.

## Cultivating Passion

To become a better presenter, choose a topic you are genuinely passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. Working on and delivering a talk about something that makes you feel deeply passionate allows you to experience presenting "from your soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>. This experience of presenting with passion can then be applied to future business presentations or other topics, helping you tap into that feeling of conviction even when the subject matter is not as personally engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.

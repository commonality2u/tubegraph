Marily Naa, Product Lead at Meta and former Google employee (working on Google Glass, computer vision, and machine learning around speech recognition), teaches a popular course on Maven about [[AI in product management | AI and product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. She shares her insights on the evolving landscape of product management in the age of artificial intelligence.

## AI as a Default

Marily Naa asserts that in the future, everything will be AI by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This means AI will be integrated into every product to enhance user experience and improve product functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## The Evolution of the Product Manager Role

Naa predicts that all product managers will eventually become [[ai_product_management_and_its_future | AI product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This shift is driven by the increasing need for personalized experiences, robust recommender systems (like those seen on Netflix), and continuous automation in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

Instead of replacing product managers, AI will free up their time from less strategic tasks, allowing them to focus on new areas of product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

## Key Considerations for AI Product Management

### Embracing Uncertainty and Research
[[Role of Product Management in the AI Era | Product managers]] will need to become comfortable partnering with research scientists who can develop smart models for automation, personalization, and recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This requires accepting the inherent uncertainty in research, as outcomes may not always align with initial hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### The "Shiny Object Trap"
It's crucial to avoid the "shiny object trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. AI should not be implemented for its own sake, but rather to solve a specific problem or address a pain point in a smart way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

### When Not to Use AI
AI is generally not suitable for Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Instead, PMs should "fake it" with prototypes to validate ideas and gather buy-in before investing in complex AI model development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. AI should be leveraged when there is existing data, or data from an adjacent product, that can be used to create something meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

### Data Requirements
The amount of data needed for AI/ML varies significantly based on the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Simple classification tasks (like identifying a cat or dog) might only need 15-20 labeled photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, while complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) or voice recognition applications require thousands of data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Gathering good quality data can be a challenge, sometimes even requiring creative data collection methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.

### Building vs. Using Pre-trained Models
Big tech companies often benefit from building and training their own models with diverse data to ensure unique and high-quality services (e.g., speech recognition, GPT-like systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. However, startups and smaller companies might find it more efficient to utilize existing public models like ChatGPT or Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

## Skills for [[How to become an AI product manager | AI Product Managers]]

### Understanding AI Concepts
PMs don't need to code or train models, as there are no-code approaches available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. However, it's beneficial to understand how models work, how they are trained, and how they output probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

### Strategic Thinking and Problem Solving
An AI PM's core responsibility is to "solve the right problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This involves identifying problems that can be effectively addressed by AI, ensuring there's an audience and a pain point for the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Data-Driven Mindset
PMs should learn to identify opportunities to improve products by leveraging existing user data. Even simply collecting and visualizing data is a significant first step towards AI implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Collaboration with Research Scientists
PMs should actively engage with AI research scientists, shadowing them, and learning about their work to understand the endless potential of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Bridging the gap between academic research and product commercialization is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

### Influencing and Storytelling
AI PMs need strong communication and influence skills to convince research scientists to trust their vision for converting research into products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>. They also need to articulate complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

### Monetization
A key skill for PMs is identifying ways to monetize AI research and products, even if they are initially offered for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>.

## [[Leveraging AI tools in product management | AI Tools and Techniques]] for PMs

### ChatGPT for Product Management Tasks
ChatGPT can significantly assist PMs in their daily workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>:
*   **Mission Statements**: It can rewrite mission statements to be more accessible, inspiring, and understandable across various disciplines, from leadership to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **User Segments**: It can generate diverse user segments with motivations and pain points that human ideation might miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Idea Generation**: It can provide ideas for AI-enhanced features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### No-Code AI Tools
For those without a technical background, no-code tools like **AutoML** (offered by Google Cloud) allow users to train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. These tools require labeled data inputs (e.g., photos), but simplify the training process. An example cited is a company using drones and AutoML to analyze wind turbine photos for maintenance needs, reducing a three-week task to a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

### Understanding Models and Training
*   **Model**: A model is akin to a child's brain, learning to identify patterns from repeated information. It takes an input (e.g., an image) and outputs a recognition (e.g., "that looks like a rhino") along with a probability of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   **Training**: Training a model involves providing vast amounts of labeled data (e.g., thousands of images of cats and dogs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. The model processes this information, learns patterns, and eventually can make predictions or classifications based on new inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. For speech recognition, the input is audio, and the output is a text transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

## Notable AI Applications

*   **Google Glass Language Translation**: An augmented reality application where Google Glass takes audio input from a speaker of one language, transcribes it, translates it, and displays it on the screen in the other person's language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. This unlocks communication barriers and is a real-world example of advanced AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Students have successfully built AI models that can analyze X-ray images to identify potential health issues and even suggest next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.
*   **Lensa**: An AI-based tool that transforms photos into artistic avatars, including pet photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

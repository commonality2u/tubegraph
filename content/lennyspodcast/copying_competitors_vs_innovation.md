Growth is a relatively new field, and there's a strong interest in "growth hacks" or quick fixes. However, many shared tips are out of context or specific to one example, often not applying as a pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This section outlines growth tactics that frequently fail, highlighting the pitfalls of blind copying and the importance of genuine [[Creativity and Innovation in Product Design | innovation]].

## Growth Tactics That Never Work

### Over-Obsessing Over Competition

While understanding what competitors are doing is extremely important for inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>, blindly copying their tactics or flows often leads to subpar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. Every product experience is unique to its customer and channel, and you don't know the full context of why a competitor's experience looks a certain way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Blind Copying Leads to Mediocracy
> Copying competition is the fastest way to [[Differentiation and cost leadership strategies | mediocracy]] because you will never be a leader if you copy someone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. A leader is someone who separates themselves from the pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

Instead of copying, use competitor analysis as an input into ideation, not as the final solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. It helps to avoid starting from scratch, which is often inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. Always balance inspiration with [[Creativity and Innovation in Product Design | innovating]] your own product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

#### The Danger of Benchmarks
Benchmarks are also very dangerous to use because how companies define numbers can vary significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Taking a benchmark and setting it as a goal is a sure way to fail an initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. Benchmarking data can be a valuable input but should not be blindly followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

### The Illusion of Unique Problems

Many teams believe their growth problems are unique, leading them to try and re-engineer solutions from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. However, most problems have been faced and often solved by others in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.

> [!TIP] Learn from Others
> Do not start from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. Find people who have solved similar problems and talk to them to understand their approach and lessons learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. This can provide an incredible shortcut to an optimal solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.

Solving every problem uniquely is extremely inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. Focus on creating patterns or frameworks to solve not only the current problem but also future similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. The goal is to quickly reach 60% of a solution, then apply authentic implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

### Redesigning Your Marketing Site or Rebranding

A common mistake is undertaking a rebrand or marketing site redesign with the expectation of driving growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. This tactic rarely produces good performance results and often hurts growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Rebranding as a Growth Driver is a Failed Promise
> A new CMO often designs the website or brand based on personal taste, promising increased acquisition, but it rarely materializes into anything meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

While a rebrand might be necessary for other strategic reasons (e.g., entering a new market, product evolution), it's typically a step back in performance that requires significant optimization efforts to even return to previous levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. Expect a hit at launch and allocate 3-6 months post-launch for optimization to potentially outperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.

### Other "Quick Fix" Fails

*   **Color Optimizations:** Testing shades of colors or subtle design changes is an outdated tactic from the early 2000s that doesn't work anymore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Sign-ups (OAuth):** Adding Google, Facebook, or Slack OAuth rarely drives incremental acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. It primarily causes a mix shift in how people sign up, not an increase in total sign-ups or activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.
*   **One-Email Wonders:** Stressing over the impact of a single email is pointless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. One email will never cause significant lift due to low open and click-through rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. Email should be considered a series of communications as part of a larger strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.
*   **Obsessing Over Removing Friction (Simplifying):** While addressing genuinely confusing or high-cognitive-load friction is important, simply removing steps or oversimplifying to the point of losing product identity is a failed growth tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>. "Simplifying onboarding" is an action, not the underlying problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>. The actual problem might be user confusion or lack of education, for which simplifying might be a solution, but it's not the goal itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.

## Growth Through Innovation and Strategic Thinking

Instead of relying on shortcuts or blind imitation, sustainable growth comes from strategic thinking, understanding patterns, and continuous [[lessons_on_company_growth_and_innovation | innovation]].

### The Value of Advisors
Not hiring advisors is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. Advisors provide access to networks and data points from their experiences, accelerating learning and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>. Even experienced operators hire advisors for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. To vet an advisor, conduct a paid workshop with them on a specific problem to see them in action before hiring them on an ongoing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. Regularly evaluate their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

### The Problem of Too Much Risk Averseness
Growth teams can become paralyzed by a need to test everything, slowing down progress and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>. While experimentation is core to growth, not every initiative requires precise scientific measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Trust Your Intuition and Move Fast
> If a desired sample size cannot be collected in a month, don't test it through A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>. Use pre-versus-post analysis instead. Not everything needs a scientific explanation to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>. Data is valuable, but intuition and understanding the market are also crucial for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.
>
> Growth is about learning through failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The goal is to shorten the failure cycles, not eliminate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>. Prioritize initiatives where precision is important and quickly attainable, and for others, "just go for it" and iterate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.

### Diversifying Growth Channels
Relying solely on external channels like SEO, SEM, or social media makes a company dependent on platforms like Google, which can change algorithms at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. These are "paid" or "controlled" channels where you compete in someone else's territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.

> [!TIP] Invest in Owned and Earned Channels
> Growth teams' top priority should be to create "owned" or "earned" channels where nobody else can compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>. This includes relying on virality, word-of-mouth, user-generated content, or community-driven acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. These channels are stable and offer more control, reducing reliance on external algorithms and rising acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.

While creating owned channels like user-generated content libraries or strong referral mechanisms requires significant product, engineering, and marketing resources, it's a long-term investment that yields continuous returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. Not exploring these channels means leaving too much of your growth future in the hands of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.

### Evolving Growth Models
If a company has a growth model that works, it's great to optimize and scale it, but this model won't last forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Most growth loops have a limited lifespan of 5-7 years for producing meaningful results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Continuously Layer New Growth Models
> Companies must continuously overlay different growth models—Product-Led Growth, Marketing-Led Growth, Sales-Led Growth—onto their existing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>. This diversification ensures continued growth and prevents market gaps that competitors could exploit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. Allocate 20-25% of growth team time annually to introduce new growth loops or channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. These new initiatives may take 6-18 months to produce visible revenue, so early investment is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>.

### Growth Frameworks
To better understand how to think about growth, consider these powerful frameworks:
*   **Growth Loops:** A self-contained flywheel where an action generates another action, leading to sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.
*   **Race Car Framework:** Categorizes growth initiatives into Engines (sustainable loops), Fuel (e.g., paid marketing), Turbo Boosts (large, infrequent events), and Lubrications (optimizations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>.
*   **Adjacent User Theory:** Focuses on bringing in users outside the ideal customer profile and optimizing their experiences to expand product reach without direct product market fit expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>.

Developing a clear and compelling product vision is crucial for aligning teams and fostering successful product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. A good vision acts as a powerful tool to guide efforts and inspire action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Even junior product managers should cultivate a vision for their specific area or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Vision vs. Mission

It's important to differentiate between vision and mission:
*   **Vision** is a picture of the destination or the future state you aim to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. It's like fast-forwarding to the future and describing the image of what the world will look like when you get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Uber's vision was "a world where you get to this continuous trip so that you do not need parking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Microsoft's vision was "a computer on every desk and in every home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **Mission** is the purpose of why you are doing something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. It defines why the company or team exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Uber's mission was "reliable transport everywhere and for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   *Example*: TED's mission is "to spread ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Elements of a Good Vision
A strong product vision has four key components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>:
1.  **Lofty**: It needs to be something that feels exciting and almost scary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Realistic and Attainable**: It cannot feel so "pie in the sky" that it seems out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
3.  **Devoid of Current Limitations**: It should be thought of in a vacuum from today's technical or other limitations, as current limitations might not exist in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.
4.  **Grounded in a Clear and Potent Problem**: The vision must address a real problem that people are excited about solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Communicating the Vision
A vision isn't just a tagline; it's a story that can be communicated in various concrete ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Storytelling is one of the most powerful skills for a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

### 1. The "Once Upon a Time" Framework (Mad Libs Approach)
This simple, yet magical, framework helps structure the vision as a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>:
*   "Once Upon a Time" [state the initial problem or situation] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>
*   "And because of that" [describe the consequences or implications of the problem] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>
*   "Then one day" [describe the big change or solution implemented] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>
*   "And as a result" [describe the new state of the world or the dent made in the universe] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>

### 2. The News Article / Press Release
Write a news article from the future, imagining that the vision has successfully come to pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Start with a compelling headline and subtitle that would appear in a major tech publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. This forces clarity on the impact and feeling you want to leave people with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

### 3. Visual Mock-ups / Sketches
A picture tells a thousand words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Work with a design partner, or even sketch it out yourself using low-fidelity mocks or Post-it notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. This makes the vision tangible and helps people visualize the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. For example, mocking up what the app store screenshots would look like if the product solved key problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

## Steps to Develop a Product Vision

The process of [[product_strategy_and_vision_development | developing a product strategy]] and vision involves three key phases:

### 1. Empathize
This phase focuses on deeply understanding the customer and the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.
*   **"Understand Work"**: Product managers should actively use their own products ("dog food") and competitors' products ("cat food") to build intuition and expose themselves to good product experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
*   **"Top 10 Problems You Should Know" Document**: Maintain a living document of the top 10 most potent problems users have with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This can include qualitative, quantitative, or even technical debt issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Engagement**: Bring in stakeholders (marketing, operations, support, data science) and ask them to contribute their top 10 problems, ranked by pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. This provides a multifaceted view of problems and builds buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

This empathize phase brings [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | clarity]] to the problems that need to be solved, which acts as the North Star for the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Product managers should use research to update their mental model of the customer and their needs, rather than just waiting for research to tell them what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

### 2. Create
Once problems are clearly understood, the "create" phase involves envisioning what the world would look like if those problems were solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. This is where the communication techniques (Mad Libs, news article, visual mocks) are applied to articulate the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. The use of a "how might we" question can foster discussion and creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

### 3. Evangelize
The final step is to evangelize the vision across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. This is critical because a great vision and roadmap are useless if no one knows about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.
*   **Concentric Circles of Influence**:
    1.  **Core Team**: Ensure the immediate product team (PMs, engineering, design, research) deeply understands and is bought into the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Share the workshop output as a living document, open for comments, to allow for collective polishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.
    2.  **Stakeholders and Adjacent Teams**: Present the vision to the broader group of stakeholders who contributed problems and whose teams will play a part in the vision's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. Be prepared for variations of feedback, from constructive suggestions to skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.
    3.  **Leadership**: Take the vision to leadership, aiming as high as possible in the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. Leaders can then amplify the story, creating a ripple effect throughout the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

Evangelization is easier when stakeholders know their input was heard and incorporated into the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

## Cadence and Scope of Vision Work
A macro product vision should be **Evergreen** and last for at least 3-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. If a vision needs to be re-created every year, it wasn't a good one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. Over time, more fidelity can be added to parts of the vision, such as Sizzle reels or detailed mocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

Individual product managers, from junior to senior, should develop a variation of a 3-year vision for their specific area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>. For shorter-term plans (next 6 months), a simple mock or "Tweet" (a short, concise statement of what will be launched) can serve as a "mini vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

## Product Management as [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | Clarity and Conviction]]
The core craft of product management is bringing [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | clarity]] and having [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | conviction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
*   **Clarity**: Involves sifting out noise to define the core problem and simplify understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>. This is achieved through understanding work, problem lists, and a clear narrative of insights, strategy, and big rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. Writing concise two-page documents for strategy (insights, approach/strategy, big rocks) helps bring this clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.
*   **Conviction**: Is a strong feeling or belief about what the world should be, not necessarily absolute certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. It's about confidently picking a lane and being able to stand by a decision, even when there's risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>.

## Tips for Becoming Better at Vision Development
*   **Focus on Problems**: The most vital step is to deeply understand the top problems that affect your product and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>. This problem list should be visceral and crisp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>.
*   **Sketch Solutions**: Take out a Post-it note and sketch what the world would look like if you solved a key problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>. This simple act helps in visualizing the future and convincing yourself and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>.
*   **Practice Product Sense**: Consistently open favorite apps, identify their problems, and mentally design solutions. This is constant training for your [[product_management_skill_development_framework | product sense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.

## Product Culture and Vision
A company's culture significantly impacts how products are built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>. Culture evolves constantly, and good product leaders intentionally shape their team's culture to support the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Key cultural tenets for effective product development include:
*   **Freedom of Responsibility**: Giving team members autonomy with the understanding that they are accountable for outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.
*   **Informed Captain**: Ensuring there is one clear person on the hook for a decision, who gathers all input but ultimately decides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability as Strength**: Fostering an environment where team members genuinely care about each other, allowing for honest feedback and better collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>. This enables teams to refine documents and ideas collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:29">[01:23:29]</a>. This contrasts with just being "liked"; it's about being "loved" through extending oneself for another's spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>.

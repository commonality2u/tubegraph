Dalton Caldwell, a managing director and group partner at Y Combinator, emphasizes the critical role of the [[early_stages_of_product_development_and_pivot | pivot]] in a [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | startup journey]]. Having worked with over 10 years and 21 YC batches, he has seen numerous companies, including unicorns like Instacart, Retool, Brex, and DoorDash, navigate the challenges of startup life, often through strategic pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. Caldwell is often referred to as the "king of the [[early_stages_of_product_development_and_pivot | pivot]]" due to his expertise in guiding founders through this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## What Makes a Good Pivot?

A successful [[early_stages_of_product_development_and_pivot | pivot]] typically "gets warmer instead of colder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, meaning it moves closer to an area where the founders are already experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. It should also build on lessons learned from the prior idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Caldwell likens a good [[early_stages_of_product_development_and_pivot | pivot]] to "going home" â€“ it's warmer and closer to something the founders are familiar with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### Examples of Successful Pivots

*   **Brex:** Originally named "Vyond," the company started as a VR headset venture by Stanford dropouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. They had no expertise in optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Caldwell advised them to pivot to something they knew, leading them to leverage their past experience with a fintech company in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This pivot resulted in Brex becoming a decacorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Retool:** Initially a PTP Venmo competitor in the UK called "Cashew," the startup was struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. The founders had built internal tools and dashboards for Cashew, and they pivoted to focus on creating internal tools, which became Retool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Segment:** This successful company started with software for universities to help students tell professors they were confused in class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Through this initial idea, they learned about how analytics worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Their subsequent pivots led them to create a JavaScript tool for sending events to multiple endpoints, a product that emerged from insights gained during their "grinding for multiple years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   **Zip:** The founders of Zip went through six pivots before finding their current success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Dalton Caldwell advised them to look for large, publicly traded or private equity-owned companies with low Net Promoter Scores (NPS) whose software was "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. This strategy led them to procurement software, a market with an incumbent that customers disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

## When to Consider a Pivot

Deciding when to [[early_stages_of_product_development_and_pivot | pivot]] requires nuanced advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. A key indicator is whether the founders have run "out of ideas" on how to make their current product grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. If there are still "half a dozen or a dozen really good grow ideas" that haven't been tried, it might be a reason to "state the course" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. However, if the ideas are generic and uninspired, like "maybe we should pay influencers or something," it's a stronger sign to [[early_stages_of_product_development_and_pivot | pivot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

## Avoiding "Tarpit Ideas"

Founders should avoid "tarpit ideas," which are deceptively appealing concepts that many people gravitate towards but often lead to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. These ideas seem like unsolved problems, garner positive feedback, and can even gain initial validation, drawing founders in and getting them stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

Examples of tarpit ideas:
*   Apps to coordinate with friends for going out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   Music discovery platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
*   Foursquare clones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

These ideas are appealing because they elicit positive feedback, but they are consistently difficult to build successful businesses around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>. To avoid these, founders should diversify their information diet and draw on unique personal interests or experiences to find [[elements_of_breakthrough_startup_ideas_inflections_insights_and_founder_future_fit | breakthrough startup ideas]] that aren't conventional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

## The Role of Persistence in Pivoting

Caldwell's core mantra for founders is "just don't die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The underlying theme across many successful [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_startup_founding | startup journey]]s is that founders often push through situations where, rationally, they should have given up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Airbnb, for instance, had several near-death experiences before finding success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Founders must possess an "irrational intention to keep going" even when the world tells them it's not working, and they feel completely defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This [[resilience_and_persistence_in_startups | resilience]] and willingness to persevere are crucial for making successful pivots. Most startups will go through a point where "all hope is lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. Caldwell estimates that around 50% of companies in YC batches that experienced "very, very hard situations" still managed to turn things around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

However, there is a time to give up. Caldwell advises founders to consider ceasing operations if they are no longer having fun, don't enjoy spending time with co-founders, or if the venture is profoundly affecting their mental health and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. If founders genuinely love their customers, their product, and the problem they're solving, even when things are going bad, it's a strong signal to keep going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

Ultimately, the ability to [[early_stages_of_product_development_and_pivot | pivot]] effectively stems from an internal belief and conviction that the company will work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This conviction isn't always present at the very [[early_stages_of_product_development_and_pivot | early stages of product development and pivot | early stages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>, but it builds over time as the product gains traction and customers provide positive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>. This "network effect virtual cycle" strengthens the founders' belief, making them more resilient to the challenges of the [[early_stages_of_product_development_and_pivot | startup journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.

Jeff Weinstein, a product leader at Stripe for over six years, has been instrumental in [[startup_scaling_strategies | scaling]] Stripe's payments infrastructure to hundreds of billions of dollars in volume annually. He also led 0 to 1 bets and most recently oversaw the [[startup_scaling_strategies | scaling]] of Stripe Atlas, which enables company incorporation in a single day, handling complex tasks like 83b elections, incorporation documents, EIN acquisition, and share purchases that previously took weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. As of the podcast launch, one in six new Delaware Corporations are started on Stripe Atlas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:03">[01:32:03]</a>.

Weinstein's approach to product leadership emphasizes a "go go go + optimism, long-term compounding philosophy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:06">[02:01:06]</a>. This philosophy is crucial for both immediate action and sustainable, strategic growth.

## Philosophy: Go Go Go + Optimism and Long-Term Compounding

Weinstein views the world as full of opportunities for immediate action, promoting an optimistic "go go go" energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. This approach aims to inject energy and ignite interest in others, creating a self-feeding dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>.

However, he learned the necessity of a "longer-term compounding more strategic mindset" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>. Some goals, like building complex [[building_infrastructure_and_processes_for_productled_sales | infrastructure]] and services, cannot be solved quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:08">[01:31:08]</a>. It requires foundational investments that will "never regret spending time in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. Examples include improving the latency and reliability of payment APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:08">[01:17:08]</a> or ensuring reliable 83b election mailings to the IRS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:08">[01:25:08]</a>. The challenge lies in mixing this urgent "go go go" attitude with a long-term compounding vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:08">[01:33:08]</a>.

### Case Study: Stripe's Global Expansion

Initially, Stripe's incremental country additions and new payment methods were relatively flat, despite significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:08">[01:32:08]</a>. The "go go go" approach wasn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:08">[01:42:08]</a>. The team had to step back and consider what the world would look like in 10 years, leading to a slower initial phase focused on building internal platforms and sending people globally to establish payment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:08">[01:41:08]</a>. This strategic shift, despite a flatline period, eventually led to a non-linear increase, expanding from 10 payment methods to over 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>.

## Identifying and Solving Burning Problems

Weinstein's focus on "craft and quality" stems from a past failure where his startup's product, while liked, wasn't solving a "burning enough problem" that customers would stop their day to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:08">[01:55:08]</a>. He aims to find problems where people "will leap through the computer" to find a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>.

Key techniques for identifying these problems include:
*   **Active Listening (and Silence):** Instead of pitching, ask open-ended questions like "What would you be working on if you weren't talking to me?" or "What grinded your gears last week?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:08">[02:26:08]</a>. Then, "sit there in silence" to allow customers to open up about their biggest problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:08">[02:32:08]</a>.
*   **Rapid Response:** Prioritize and quickly respond to customer feedback, especially when they take the time to communicate an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:08">[02:59:08]</a>. This can turn detractors into promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:08">[03:33:08]</a>.
*   **Focus on Paying Customers:** Discount feedback from non-paying friends or internal biases. Focus solely on target customers who are willing to exchange money for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:08">[03:57:08]</a>.

## Stripe Atlas: Automating the Company Formation Process

Stripe Atlas was born from identifying a significant problem: entrepreneurs worldwide had to fly to the U.S. to form a U.S. company to access the U.S. financial system and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:08">[03:59:08]</a>. This "burning problem" indicated an important opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:08">[03:58:08]</a>.

### The Automation Journey

The mission of Atlas is to "radically simplify the process of getting a company started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:08">[04:11:08]</a>. This involves continuously solving more of the problem over time by automating existing complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:08">[04:14:08]</a>.

A prime example is the 83b election process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:08">[04:30:08]</a>. This complex IRS rule requires sending a one-page document via snail mail within 30 days, with no verification, and no redo if missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:08">[04:39:08]</a>. Atlas chose to tackle this despite potential liability and difficulty in monetization, driven by the core mission of reducing complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:08">[04:45:08]</a>.

By podcast launch, Atlas fully automated the entire company formation process into a single click, handling all downstream administrative activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:08">[04:49:08]</a>. This allows founders to focus on building and shipping their business within a day or two, rather than administrative burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:08">[04:54:08]</a>. This was achieved through deep integration with governments and banking partners, enabling access to the financial system even before official government approvals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:08">[05:14:08]</a>.

### Impact and Operational Strategy

Atlas, run by a lean team of 10 people, operates by automating tasks rather than taking on work that requires manual competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:08">[05:50:08]</a>. For tasks like mail sending, they use third-party vendors and backup vendors, forcing them to build better software to evaluate external performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:08">[05:58:08]</a>. The team annually re-evaluates whether to internalize processes, usually deciding against it to maintain focus on automation and leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:08">[05:51:08]</a>.

The automation efforts have led to significant results:
*   Atlas has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) above 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:08">[06:33:08]</a>.
*   Companies formed through Atlas are charging customers sooner, cutting the time to first customer by half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:08">[06:40:08]</a>.
*   More solo founders are using Atlas, reflecting the reduced barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:08">[06:40:08]</a>.
*   The cohort of 2024 startups in Atlas reached $50 million in revenue twice as quickly as the 2023 cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:08">[06:40:08]</a>.
*   As of now, 55,000 companies started through Atlas generate $5 billion in revenue per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:08">[06:40:08]</a>.
*   Approximately 20% of users reported they wouldn't have started their business without Atlas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>.

## Getting Stuff Done at a Large Company

Jeff Weinstein has learned key strategies for shipping new products and initiatives within large organizations like Stripe:

*   **Customer-Driven Strategy:** Instead of personal ideas, present solutions based on direct customer feedback and burning problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:08">[04:09:08]</a>. Frame the initiative as helping the company gain market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:08">[04:26:08]</a>.
*   **Visual Storyboarding:** Draw the "unconstrained perfect solution" with a Sharpie, without getting bogged down in high-fidelity design tools initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:08">[04:09:08]</a>.
*   **Show Tangible Progress:** Focus on getting a "first version working" or demonstrating "proof of existence" quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:08">[04:19:08]</a>. This builds momentum and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:08">[04:29:08]</a>.
*   **Transparent Metrics:** Use simple, customer-oriented metrics that everyone can understand and track daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:08">[04:36:08]</a>. For Atlas, the key metric was "companies with zero support tickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:08">[04:57:08]</a>. This drives motivation and clarity, reducing the need for constant updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:08">[04:37:08]</a>.
    *   **"Users Having a Bad Day" Metric:** For any business, if unsure what to measure, create a chart of "users having a bad day" by logging events when a user encounters a problem (e.g., 404 error, delayed payout) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:08">[05:46:08]</a>. This provides "eye-opening" frequencies of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:08">[05:59:08]</a>.
*   **Empowering Teams:** Turn engineers into "PMs" by assigning them topics from support tickets and empowering them to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:08">[05:27:08]</a>.
*   **"Study Groups":** A popular internal program at Stripe to improve craft and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>. Random groups of 4-8 employees (any role) pretend to be a customer with a specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>.
    *   **Rule 1:** "You do no longer work at Stripe" – participants must not use internal knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>.
    *   **Rule 2:** "We're not here to solve any problems" – the focus is solely on practicing empathy for the customer's experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>.
    *   This program provides deeply eye-opening insights into user struggles, fostering empathy and motivating action without explicit mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>.
*   **Economic Viability:** Clearly communicate why a product will run in an economically viable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. If it's for customer acquisition, show its efficiency; if it's for margin or ecosystem growth, show those metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:08">[02:09:08]</a>.

> "If you look back in your emails and and you if you've started a company recently you're starting company right now the whole world is counting on you to pick a customer solve their problem 10 times better than their alternative get it to them charge for it become economically viable and build a great business that provides great Services we are not counting on you to become experts at this silliness of administratively running your company." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>

Weinstein emphasizes that the entire customer journey, including sales, support, and compliance, should be considered "product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:08">[02:57:08]</a>. He highlights that in [[efficient_business_operations_with_small_teams | efficient business operations]], companies should leverage specialization and partnership rather than trying to do everything themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:08">[02:15:08]</a>. The growth of Atlas, even in a competitive market, demonstrates the power of relentlessly focusing on the customer problem and long-term automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:08">[02:11:08]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to "dramatically lower the barrier to great people solving problems" globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:08">[03:54:08]</a>, unlocking an immense amount of entrepreneurial energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:08">[04:16:08]</a>.

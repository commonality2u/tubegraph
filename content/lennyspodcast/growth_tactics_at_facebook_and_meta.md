Naomi Gleit, Head of Product at Meta and its longest-serving executive other than Mark Zuckerberg, was employee number 29 at what was then called Facebook and has been with the company for almost 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. She has witnessed the company scale from 30 employees to a $1.5 trillion business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Gleit played a foundational role in the early [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth strategy]] and team at Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## The Legendary Growth Team

The Facebook growth team is often considered the first real growth team in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. This team developed many core [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth levers]] and techniques still used by companies today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. The concept of the growth team didn't originate directly from Mark Zuckerberg, but rather was established and grown by individuals like Naomi Gleit, Alex Schultz, and Javier Oliván, who then demonstrated its value to Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

### Key Growth Metrics and Insights

One of the most talked-about metrics from the early growth team was "seven friends in 10 days" or "10 friends in 14 days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. These metrics represented different points on a retention curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

Initially, the growth team was heavily focused on acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. However, through the use of "growth accounting"—a framework developed by Danny Ferrante—they analyzed net growth by considering new users, stale users (those who hadn't logged in for 30 days), and resurrected users (those who returned after 30 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. This analysis revealed that churn and resurrection lines were significantly larger than the new user line, indicating that retention was the biggest lever for driving net growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

Consequently, the team's focus shifted dramatically towards engagement and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. By examining variables that correlated most strongly with retention, they discovered the importance of "friending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. The "magic moments" of adding seven friends in 10 days (or 10 friends in 14 days) correlated with a higher likelihood of user retention, as users experienced the value of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. The goal was to ensure this "magic moment" occurred quickly after registration to prevent churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.

### Product-Led Growth

A significant innovation pioneered by the Facebook growth team was the shift from a traditional marketing-driven approach to a [[productled_growth_strategies | data-driven and product-driven approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. Historically, growth was expected to come from marketing or communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. However, the growth team's insight was that the product itself was the biggest lever for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. This meant having a product and engineering team dedicated to optimizing areas like:

*   Registration flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>
*   Invite flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>
*   New user onboarding to help users reach their "seven friends in 10 days" milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>

#### Understand, Identify, Execute Framework

In 2009, the growth team halted all other roadmap items to focus solely on data instrumentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. This was driven by the principle of "why guess when you can know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. They instrumented every step of the registration and new user onboarding flows to identify drop-off points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. This "understand, identify, execute" framework allowed them to:

1.  **Understand**: Gather the necessary data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.
2.  **Identify**: Pinpoint key opportunities for growth, such as increasing friending in the new user experience or addressing a 20% drop-off at the email confirmation step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
3.  **Execute**: Build products to address these identified opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

This data-driven, product-driven approach became the "special sauce" of the growth team and was eventually extended to other areas of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

### Examples of Product-Led Growth Beyond Core Growth

The product-driven philosophy of the growth team was applied to various functions:

*   **Social Impact**: Instead of a traditional Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) wing, the team built a product to enable the community to raise money for charity, which has raised billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.
*   **Translations**: Rather than hiring professional translators, the growth team developed a product that allowed the Facebook community to make in-line translations, with a system to up-rank and down-rank contributions, similar to Wikipedia. This approach enabled Facebook to support over 100 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

### Removing Barriers to Growth

The growth team's projects primarily focused on removing "macro" and "micro" barriers to access and usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>.

*   **Macro Barriers**: These included expanding access to different user groups, such as high school students, work networks, and eventually anyone with an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. Later efforts included removing barriers for those without smartphones by building rich Facebook experiences for feature phones and low-end devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>, and addressing internet access affordability through initiatives like internet.org <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.
*   **Micro Barriers**: The team's optimization efforts focused on removing friction within product flows. For example, when 20% of users weren't confirming their email, they found that many were clicking on other notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. The solution was to allow unconfirmed accounts to receive notifications, and if they clicked any, it would count as account confirmation (proving email ownership), thereby removing the micro-barrier of needing to specifically find and click the confirmation email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

### The Importance of Product-Market Fit

Naomi Gleit notes that while the growth team deserves credit, much of Facebook's success was due to having strong product-market fit from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. The high demand for the product meant that many of their efforts focused on simply removing barriers and friction, rather than creating demand from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. The specific activation metric (e.g., seven friends in 10 days) was valuable less for its precise regression connection to retention, and more for its role as a rallying point that provided extreme clarity and a shared goal for the entire team to optimize towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

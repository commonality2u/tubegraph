Effective [[improving_public_speaking_skills | public speaking]] and storytelling are crucial for memorability, whether in business or personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Many professionals aspire to be "storytellers" but fear standing out from the "herd," risking being forgotten by their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Our minds are not designed to remember facts, statistics, or platitudes unless they are attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

Matthew Dicks, author of *Storyworthy*, a 59-time Moth StorySlam winner and nine-time Grand Slam champ, emphasizes the importance of storytelling. He works as an elementary school teacher and also coaches individuals and teams at companies like Slack, Amazon, Lego, and Salesforce through his company, Speak Up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Core Elements of Effective Storytelling

### The 5-Second Moment of Transformation or Realization
Every good story is centered around a singular "5-second moment" of either transformation or realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   **Transformation** involves telling a story about once being one kind of person and becoming a new kind of person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   **Realization** involves thinking one thing, then experiencing events that lead to a new way of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
These changes culminate in a single moment where the "flip" occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. The purpose of a story is to bring this moment to maximum clarity for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. The surrounding 98% of the story provides context to bring that singular moment to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

Knowing the ending moment of change also helps structure the story. For true stories, the storyteller already knows the end, which informs the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. A story is essentially about two opposing moments in time: a beginning and an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. This structure provides importance and allows the audience to connect, as change has universal appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.

### Checklist for a Good Story
According to Matthew Dicks, a good story includes:
1.  **Change:** There must be a moment of transformation or realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.
2.  **The Dinner Test:** The story should be told in a way that feels natural, like a slightly elevated conversation you'd have at dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>. Avoid "performance art" elements like unattributed dialogue or starting with a sound effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.
3.  **Personal Connection:** The story must be *your* story, allowing you to express vulnerability and reveal something about yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>. Stories about others can be framed by showing how their experience informed or changed your own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

### Importance of Stakes and Surprise
Stakes are what the audience should be worried about or wondering about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>. If the audience isn't wondering what you're about to say, they're not listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:00">[24:14:00]</a>.
*   **The Elephant:** Immediately present a big thing at the beginning of the story to make the audience wonder what will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:00">[25:24:00]</a>.
*   **The Backpack:** Tell the audience your plan or hopes before carrying it out, so they can feel those hopes and dreams with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a>.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Offer small hints or bits of information without revealing the complete idea, building anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.
*   **Hourglasses:** When the audience is on the edge of their seat, slow time down and load the story with details to prolong the suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>.
*   **Crystal Balls:** Predict a terrible future to create worry and stakes in the audience's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:00">[27:48:00]</a>.

**Surprise** is a beautiful moment where the audience didn't see something coming, but once it happens, it feels inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>. This requires placing enough information earlier in the story, but cleverly enough that the audience doesn't connect the dots until the surprise hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:23:00">[29:23:23]</a>.

## Applying Storytelling in Business

In business, communication often defaults to being "round, white, and flavorless," making it forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:48:00">[34:48:00]</a>. To stand out, you must differentiate yourself. Our minds are not designed to remember pie charts, facts, or statistics not attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>.

To become a better communicator and storyteller in business:
*   **Assume no one wants to listen:** Operate with the assumption that your audience needs to be continually engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:07:00">[49:07:00]</a>.
*   **Integrate personal elements:** Create a "personal interest inventory"â€”a list of personal details that might connect with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>. For example, mentioning you're married can signal reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:06:00">[45:06:00]</a>. While the total addressable market for some interests (like being a marathoner) might be small, the intensity of connection if you find a match is enormous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:08:00">[46:08:00]</a>. Seek to be full of color and edge, not round and flavorless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[46:46:00]</a>.
*   **Use [[techniques_for_enhancing_public_speaking_skills | humor]]:** Daring to be funny is a brilliant way to differentiate yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:16:00">[51:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Nostalgia:** The past can be inherently funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:27:00">[53:27:00]</a>. Leveraging nostalgia in stories can demonstrate expertise and make an audience laugh, especially when introducing new products or services by contrasting them with old ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31:00">[56:31:00]</a>.
    *   **"One of these things is not like the other":** This involves presenting three things, two expected and one unexpected, with the unexpected one being humorous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:54:00">[56:54:00]</a>.
*   **Speak with adjacency (theme, meaning, or message):** Instead of matching content to content, match the story to the theme, meaning, or message you want to convey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>. For example, a scientist selling tubes told a story about buying different apples for his family, demonstrating the company's commitment to specific customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This creates positive connections that audiences remember outside of the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

## Building a Story Bank: Homework for Life
The "Homework for Life" framework is a process for continuously finding stories, even if you never plan on [[improving_public_speaking_skills | public speaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>.
*   **Daily Practice:** Every day before bed, find one moment from the day that would be worth telling as a story and write it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. Use a simple Excel spreadsheet with a date column and a column for the story note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.
*   **Develop a Storytelling Lens:** This practice trains your brain to see moments that were previously unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. Matthew Dicks initially found 1.8 moments per day and now finds 7.6 moments per day, not because his life is more interesting, but because his "lens" is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.
*   **Recovering Time:** This practice helps slow down the perception of time passing, making you accountable for each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>.
*   **Therapeutic Benefits:**
    *   **Seeing Patterns:** You begin to notice patterns in your life that you wouldn't otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. For instance, realizing you "fight" with your spouse through passive-aggressive chores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>.
    *   **Uncovering Past Memories:** Once you start looking through a storytelling lens, forgotten memories from the past will begin to resurface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.
    *   **Gaining Perspective:** The practice can reveal deeper truths about situations and people, like understanding the hidden struggles behind seemingly happy exteriors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.

To start, dedicate time nightly to reflect. Ideally, track moments throughout the day. Although only about 10% of recorded moments become full stories, the remaining 90% are valuable for holding onto your days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

## [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | Reducing Public Speaking Nervousness]]

Public speaking is a common fear, but Matthew Dicks notes he has only been nervous twice on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
*   **Pre-talk vs. During-talk Nervousness:** 98% of nervousness occurs *before* you begin speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Once you start, most of it dissipates, especially if you are prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>. Accept this pre-talk nervousness as normal; even very famous speakers experience it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>.
*   **Preparation is Key:**
    *   **Record and Listen:** Record your talk or pitch and listen to it passively while doing other activities (e.g., grocery shopping, chores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. This allows the material to "seep into your soul" and become part of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Transitions:** Most people forget the transitions between sections of their talk, not the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Actively listen to your recording, identifying transitions, and creating mental cues if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>. Practice jumping between scenes without telling the full story to solidify the flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:17">[01:24:17]</a>.
    *   **Avoid Memorization:** Memorizing a talk can lead to "suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>. Instead, aim to remember the talk without rote memorization.
*   **Start with Location and Action:** To immediately grab audience attention and establish your right to speak, start every story with a location and an action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:17">[01:38:17]</a>.
    *   **Location** activates imagination, allowing the audience to apply thousands of adjectives to the scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:24">[01:38:24]</a>.
    *   **Action** indicates that something is happening immediately, moving the story forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>.
    This technique signals to the audience that "the movie's on," encouraging them to quiet down and listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.

## The "Power of Yes" in Life and Opportunity

Saying "yes" to opportunities, even if they seem crazy or undesirable, is crucial for personal growth and discovering extraordinary experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>.
*   **Avoid Presumption:** Saying "no" often stems from the presumptuous belief that you already know what's beyond a certain door without having stepped through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>.
*   **"A Yes Can Always Become a No":** You can always say yes, step through the door, experience it, and then decide it's not for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>. Many people fail to do this due to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>.
*   **Embrace Fear:** Matthew Dicks actively seeks out things that scare him, believing those are often the things that are best for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>. His decision to do stand-up comedy, despite being terrified of it, came from challenging himself to say "yes" to something that frightened him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
*   **Extraordinary Chains:** Saying an unexpected "yes" can lead to extraordinary causal chains, connecting you with people and opportunities you never would have encountered otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>. As the quote goes, "the cave you fear contains the treasure you seek" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

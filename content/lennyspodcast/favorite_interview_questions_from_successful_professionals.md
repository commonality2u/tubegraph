## Featured Interview Questions

### Aka DeManoh
Aka DeManoh, former Head of Product at Roll and PM at Stripe, and currently a founder, asks:
**Question:** "To what do you attribute your success and you can't say luck?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
**What they look for:** This question gauges a candidate's [[importance_of_introspection_and_selfawareness_in_interviews | self-awareness]] and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It reveals how deeply they have reflected on their journey and how they perceive the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Jeff Charles
Jeff Charles, Head of Product at Ramp, asks:
**Question:** "What's the hardest thing you've ever done?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
**What they look for:** This question helps understand a candidate's definition of "hard," why it was difficult, how they overcame it, how they collaborated with others, and their level of agency in resolving the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Shishir Mehrotra
Shishir Mehrotra, CEO and co-founder of Coda, uses a "coded question test":
**Question:** "A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you... to be their business counterpart, bring this to market... what do you do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
**Approach:** Candidates usually start by asking many questions about the device's functionality, size, speed, safety, and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Shishir then interjects, stating the scientists will only answer two questions before expecting a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
**What they look for:** The goal is to see how quickly candidates, particularly product managers and engineers, can identify the one or two most impactful questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. An example of good questions include: "Is it safe enough for humans or not?" and "Is it more expensive capex or Opex (to buy or to run)?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. These two questions can lead to developing distinct market strategies (e.g., human fax machines vs. replacing airports, or transporting goods if not safe for humans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This low-stakes hypothetical scenario helps reveal a candidate's ability to simplify complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Yuki Yamashita
Yuki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma and former Head of Design at Uber, asks:
**Question:** "Describe to me a time when you're part of a controversial product decision." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>
**What they look for:** This question reveals if candidates can set up a conflict, understand its importance, represent both sides, and discuss it in an "even-keeled way," demonstrating their ability to take on different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
An alternative question is: "Talk about a big problem that you worked on." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
**What they look for:** The interviewer wants to feel "compelled to work on that problem" after hearing the description, regardless of how mundane it sounds initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This highlights a great product manager's ability for [[impact_of_storytelling_and_communication_in_interviews | storytelling]] and [[impact_of_storytelling_and_communication_in_imterviews | communication]], by explaining the existential nature of the problem and rallying others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Katie Dill, Ki Sarin, and Camille Hearst
Katie Dill (Head of Design at Stripe), Ki Sarin (CEO of Linear), and Camille Hearst (Product Leader at Spotify, former at Patreon) all share the same favorite question:
**Question:** "Tell me what work you are most proud of." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> (or "what the candidate is most proud of and why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>)
**What they look for:** This question helps interviewers understand a candidate's taste, judgment, motivations, what they consider good work or a good outcome, and what they enjoy doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. It provides insight into what a person values and how they think about things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, as well as their motivations, work ethic, and definition of "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### JZ
JZ, Head of Product at Webflow and former Airbnb colleague, focuses on behavioral questions:
**Question:** In challenging or ambiguous situations, "how do they navigate ambiguity?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>
**What they look for:** Good answers come from people who can provide structure and a clear path forward through ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. They also look for candidates who seek help and inputs, rather than rigidly adhering to a single path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This includes identifying milestones to assess if a path is working and being able to make different decisions if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Noah Weiss
Noah Weiss, Chief Product Officer at Slack, asks:
**Question:** "What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product team?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>
**What they look for:** The "unfair secret" implies something not commonly known, like a Medium post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. It helps understand *what* they learned, *how* they learned it, *how* it works, and *how* they apply it, often providing interesting inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Ben Williams
Ben Williams, former VP Product at Snyk and now an advisor, asks:
**Question:** "Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
**What they look for:** While many default to discussing roles or titles, the interviewer seeks signals of humility and [[importance_of_introspection_and_selfawareness_in_interviews | self-awareness]] regarding areas for personal and professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. They want to see openness about areas a candidate needs to work on to grow as a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
**General Observation:** Throughout interviews, Ben also looks for curiosity, noting that good PMs ask "why" constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
**Question from a candidate:** Ben was recently asked a "brilliant" question by a candidate: "Tell me about the diversity equity inclusion and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> This allows the candidate to test alignment of their personal values with those of a potential colleague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

### Merium Khan Burwitz
Merium Khan Burwitz, Head of Growth at Deel, asks:
**Question:** "What would your siblings say about you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> (If no siblings, "What would your parents say about you?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>
**What they look for:** This question reveals what a candidate believes others think of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. The interviewer looks for sincerity and [[importance_of_introspection_and_selfawareness_in_interviews | self-awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. A self-aware and humble answer, acknowledging any quirks or criticisms, is preferred over a perfect, overly positive portrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### Paige Costello
Paige Castello, Co-Head of Product Management and Head of AI at Asana, asks:
**Question:** "Tell me about a time something went wrong." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> This includes product failures or team issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
**What they look for:** This question helps evaluate a candidate's mindset, how they discuss difficult situations, and how they relate to and evaluate challenging circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. It reveals how they think and perceive themselves when things are not working well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

### Nagesh Singh
Nagesh Singh, VP of Product at Facebook, asks:
**Question:** "What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> (or for managers, "what's conventional wisdom that you bet against that you have found is actually inaccurate?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>
**What they look for:** This question aims to break the typical "interview mindset" where candidates try to predict what the interviewer wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. It forces genuine, opinionated responses, testing the candidate's authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

### Ime Omalu
Ime Omalu, Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health, and former Product Lead at Square, asks:
**Question:** "Tell me something you did that worked out but not for the reason that you thought it would work," or "tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>
**What they look for:** The primary goal is to gauge the candidate's [[importance_of_introspection_and_selfawareness_in_interviews | introspection]] and reflectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. It seeks to understand if they reflect on past decisions, why they succeeded or failed, and how they incorporate that learning into future decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

### Scott Belsky
Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe and former founder of Behance, asks:
**Question:** About something people have learned about themselves that reveals a limitation in how they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
**What they look for:** This tests [[importance_of_introspection_and_selfawareness_in_interviews | introspection]] and assesses if candidates can be open and introspective when they hit their limits or struggle, rather than blaming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
Another question Scott likes is: "Do you consider yourself lucky?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>
**What they look for:** This is a fascinating question that can reveal insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Those who are comfortable and confident should admit that they were lucky, acknowledging the role of luck and privilege in their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

### Loren Isord
Lauren Isord, Head of Growth at Notion and former Head of Growth at Airtable, asks:
**Question:** "Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>
**What they look for:** This question helps understand how candidates define "impact" and what it means to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. For a growth practitioner, a good answer often demonstrates intrinsic motivation to have a business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

### Paul Adams
Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer at Intercom, provides advice for reference calls, after a candidate has been selected for the role:
**Question:** "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>
**What they look for:** This is an "amazing question" because the referee cannot avoid answering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. It provides invaluable, honest feedback about potential areas for growth for the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

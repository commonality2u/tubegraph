Figma's approach to growth, often seen as a model for [[product_led_growth_strategy | product-led growth]], is better understood as [[community_led_growth_and_product_led_growth | community-led growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:50">[05:29:50]</a>. This strategy focuses on empowering passionate users to become evangelists, thereby driving adoption within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:05">[05:30:05]</a>.

## Origin and Philosophy
Figma's origin story is rooted in consistently putting the product in front of designers, asking for feedback, and rapidly implementing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This process of deep listening to the community helped turn early users into evangelists, shaping the product to what it is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:50">[02:38:50]</a>. This strong connection with the community is a core reason for Figma's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:03">[02:40:03]</a>.

The idea is to cultivate an emotional response—a love for the product—both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:01">[05:57:01]</a>. When users love a product enough to sing its praises, it creates a powerful growth engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:01">[05:57:01]</a>.

### Empowering User Champions
Figma's strategy involves empowering internal champions—individuals within companies who feel strongly about Figma—to make a stronger case for wider adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:07">[05:30:07]</a>. The sales team, in this model, focuses on creating human connections and equipping these internal designers with the necessary data and stories to advocate for Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:19">[05:31:19]</a>. This means the primary "sales team" is often the internal designer, enabled by Figma's direct sales efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:43">[05:43:43]</a>.

### Shifting Workflows
Figma's early success also came from addressing controversial ideas within design, such as enabling multiple designers to work in the same file simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This challenges traditional design workflows and encourages a "new way of working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. By equipping customers to champion this revolution, Figma became more than just a tool; it became a philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

## Key Strategies for [[community_led_growth_and_product_led_growth | Community-led Growth]]

*   **Building Community Intentionally**: Organic conversations and interactions about Figma are highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>.
*   **Facilitating Sharing**: The ability to share files and effectively "open source" design practices within the community fosters interest and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:07">[05:16:07]</a>.
*   **"Friends of Figma" Program**: This program engages passionate users in different geographies through Discord channels and regular meetings, helping them evangelize the product and build human connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

## Role of [[sales_involvement_in_productled_growth | Sales in Product-Led Growth]]

Figma's sales team is highly knowledgeable about the product, allowing them to engage credibly with design and product leaders among customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:01">[05:25:01]</a>. Their role is to:
*   Empower internal champions to make a stronger case for Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:07">[05:30:07]</a>.
*   Create human connections and facilitate wider deployment within companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:19">[05:31:19]</a>.
*   Provide visibility into Figma's product roadmap and what other customers are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

This partnership between product and sales aims to enable advocates as much as possible, which defines [[product_led_growth_strategy | product-led growth]] at Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

## Product Quality and Internal Use
A key factor in Figma's product quality, and thus its [[product_led_growth_strategy | product-led growth]], is the pervasive internal use of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **Dogfooding**: Figma encourages its entire company, not just designers, to use Figma and FigJam in their daily workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This includes building presentations in Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a> and using FigJam for performance review calibrations and interview debriefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Accountability**: When employees personally experience problems while using the product, it significantly increases their motivation to fix them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This personal connection with the end-user fosters a sense of responsibility and pride in the quality of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

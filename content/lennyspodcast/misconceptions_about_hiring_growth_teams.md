From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 
Growth is a relatively new field, leading to a lot of interest in "growth hacks" and shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many tips and tricks shared online are often out of context or specific to one example, meaning they do not apply as a general pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Misinformation about what growth actually is and how it should be done leads to a high failure rate among growth teams, with "head of growth" roles having a higher firing rate than even CMOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This article outlines common misconceptions and tactics that often fail, despite significant investment.

## Misconceptions in [[Hiring and developing growth leaders | Hiring Growth Leaders]] and Teams

### 1. Hiring a Growth Team Too Soon

A major misconception, particularly among startups, is that a growth team is necessary to figure out product-market fit (PMF) and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This is "absolutely not true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Product-market fit and distribution cannot be outsourced to someone with a "shiny resume" expecting them to wave a magic wand for viral campaigns, sign-ups, retention, and payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

Instead, the founder and founding team must figure out how to grow the company to its first $1 million, $5 million, or even $10 million in ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Some companies don't even create growth teams until they reach $100-$200 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The concept of "founder-led growth" is not popularized enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

A growth team is not needed until the company has:
*   **Solid Product-Market Fit (PMF)**: This means having a solution to a problem where customers not only use the solution but also retain and stay with the product. The "Chanela score" (how many people would say they cannot live without your product) can be a good indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Sufficient Data**: With only 10 users or customers, there isn't enough data for analysis, hypothesis generation, or experimentation. Growth cannot function without data volume to learn from, optimize, and innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

Waiting longer to hire a growth team ensures the entire company is trained to be responsible for growth, rather than creating an "island" growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

#### Sales-Led vs. Product-Led Companies and Hiring

The timing of hiring a growth team also depends on the company's monetization strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>:
*   **Sales-Led Companies**: If primary revenue collection is through sales, hire sales personnel much earlier than a growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Sales teams handle monetization, activation, and retention in such models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. A "growth marketing team" in this context often functions as a rebranded demand generation team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Product-Led Companies**: If the company starts with self-serve monetization, where the product sells itself (e.g., through freemium or trial acquisition), then a growth hire should likely precede a sales hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Growth roles are relevant when the product is responsible for acquisition, activation, monetization, or retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

### 2. Hiring a Growth Head to Fix Declining Business Growth

Another common mistake is hiring a "shiny growth head" to fix problems when a company's overall business growth is slowing down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. If the core business is declining, a head of growth is "destined to fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

Growth teams can optimize existing growth and lift metrics by perhaps 10-15%, but they cannot fix deeper core product or marketing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. If product-market fit is disappearing, or a competitor is encroaching, a growth team will be "absolutely helpless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Investing in a growth team in such a situation is a "huge waste of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, as the ROI might only be 1:1, insufficient to re-accelerate growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

A head of growth should be hired by an established company only when the decline in revenue, weekly active users, or other key metrics has at least plateaued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Ideally, there should be "immediate signs of life" or potential in certain areas of the business before a growth team is brought in to amplify that potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

### 3. Obsessing Over Competition

While understanding competitors is important for inspiration and staying informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>, directly copying their "best tactics" or flows is a major mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Every experience is unique to a company's customers and channels, and you often don't know the full context of what you're copying (e.g., A/B test variations, personalized experiences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.

Blindly copying competition often leads to "very subpar results" and bypasses crucial steps like ideation, user research, customer interviews, and A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. It fails "95% of the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

Using competitors for inspiration means understanding general frameworks (e.g., how they handle sharing models) and identifying common, winning elements that can be adapted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. However, these elements should only be an input into your own ideation, design, user research, and experimentation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. Copying is the "fastest way to mediocracy" and prevents a company from becoming a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

#### Benchmarks are Dangerous

Using benchmarks derived from competitors is also risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Definitions of metrics (e.g., sign-ups, conversion rates) vary widely across companies (e.g., how "prospect visitor" is defined) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. Benchmarks are valuable inputs for understanding what's possible, but blindly setting them as goals is a "sure way to fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

### 4. Believing Your Problem is Unique

A common internal belief is that a company's specific growth problem is unique and requires re-engineering a solution from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. This is almost certainly false: "your problem is not unique" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. Someone, somewhere, has likely faced and solved a similar problem, or at least encountered many failures from which to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.

Starting from scratch wastes cycles and valuable time to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. To avoid this, it's crucial to:
*   **Look at Competition**: See how competitors are solving similar problems as an input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
*   **Talk to Experts**: Find people who have solved the problem. People often love to share their experiences. Leverage networks like LinkedIn or X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. For example, seeking advice on building a community led to understanding different types of communities (user, agency, partner) and a more successful strategy at Miro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.
*   **Embrace Humility**: Admit when you don't know something. This can earn more credit than expected and provides a "shortcut" to optimal solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>.

Solving every problem uniquely is inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. In a fast-evolving market, the ability to "patternize" problems and quickly reach 60% of a solution is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.

### 5. Prioritizing SEO, SEM, and Social Over Owned/Earned Channels

Many growth teams over-prioritize search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>. While these are important, they are "owned" by platforms like Google or Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>. These channels operate on algorithms that "can give it but algorithm can also take it away at any point," leaving companies with no control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.

The number one priority for a growth team should be to create "owned" or "earned" channels that competitors cannot easily replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. This means focusing on product-led growth acquisition, such as:
*   **Virality**: Loops that spread the product through existing users.
*   **Word-of-Mouth**: Organic recommendations.
*   **User-Generated Content (UGC)**: Content created by users that attracts new acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.

These "earned" channels are stable and unique to the company. For example, Dropbox's sharing model, where users share files and recipients become aware of the product, accounts for over 50% of its acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>. This is a powerful, stable "growth engine" that no one can compete with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.

Ignoring earned channels leaves too much of a company's growth future in the hands of others, leading to increased acquisition costs and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.

### 6. Failure to Evolve Growth Models

Many companies start with one successful growth model (e.g., product-led growth, sales-led growth) and stick to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. However, just like product-market fit needs continuous evolution, so does the growth model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>. Not overlaying new growth models (product, marketing, sales) is a "huge mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

Growth models have a limited lifespan; most "growth loops" lose their ability to produce meaningful results within 5-7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. Companies need to continuously overlay different growth models to diversify their strategy and avoid the "law of shitty click-throughs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

Strategic thinking about growth involves:
*   **Proactive Planning**: Don't wait for growth to slow down before exploring new avenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   **Investment in New Loops**: Allocate 20-25% of growth team time annually to introduce new growth loops, channels, or initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>.
*   **Patience with New Initiatives**: New growth loops often take 6 months to 1.5 years to start producing visible revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>. Give teams room to try new ideas, even if they initially fail, as this prevents a crisis later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>.

Examples of growth loops and levers to consider include:
*   User-generated content (UGC) libraries (e.g., templates, case studies, reviews) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>.
*   Referral mechanisms, especially for B2C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.
*   Invitation of other team members in B2B products to complete tasks or generate reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.

### 7. Not Hiring Advisors

Not hiring advisors is a significant mistake for growth teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. Advisors provide access to networks of people with diverse data points and pattern recognition from their experiences, propelling a company forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>. They offer valuable input into decision-making that would otherwise be unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

Given the "big asymmetry of information" in the growth field and the proprietary nature of competitive data, advisors can share how things worked internally at other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:23">[01:03:23]</a>.

#### Tips for Hiring Advisors:
*   **Workshop Before Hiring**: Instead of hiring directly, conduct a paid workshop with potential advisors on a specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. This allows you to "see them in action" and assess their interaction with your team and their ability to provide actionable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.
*   **Look for Transparency**: Choose advisors who are open about their knowledge and able to have "hard conversations," provide examples, and connect thoughts into patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>.
*   **Continuous Evaluation**: Once hired on a retainer, evaluate the advisor's value monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. Their value isn't necessarily monetary attribution, but whether they offer valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>. Some advisors may only be needed for a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.

### 8. Too Much Risk Aversion / Testing Everything

Growth teams often suffer from "too much risk averseness," leading them to test "every single thing" they touch before releasing it to production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>. This "paralyzing disease" slows down progress, velocity, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>. While experimentation is fundamental to growth, testing everything is "quite terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.

#### Heuristics for When to Test:
*   **Trust Intuition**: People should trust their intuition more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.
*   **Sample Size Rule**: If a sufficient sample size cannot be collected in a month, don't A/B test it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>. Instead, opt for "pre versus post" analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.
*   **Strategic Pivots & High-Traffic Areas**: Only conduct precise, scientific experimentation for "really big strategical pivot[s]" or "very high traffic real estate" where even a 0.1% difference could mean millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.
*   **Post-Launch Readouts**: Release, then do 24-hour, 7-day, 28-day, and even one-year readouts to measure retention or expansion, but don't hold up releases for extensive testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>.
*   **Statistics are Tricky**: Don't take statistics at face value; they are directional data points, and even 95% statistical significance doesn't guarantee a specific lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

### 9. Quick-Fire Common Mistakes

*   **Color Optimizations**: Testing shades of blue or other colors for conversion is an "early 2000s tactic" that no longer works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. As long as a color is accessible and bright, "pick a color, move on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Sign-ups**: Adding Google, Facebook, Slack, or Microsoft OAuth often doesn't drive incremental acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. It typically causes a "mix shift" of existing users rather than bringing in new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. It doesn't improve activation or retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>.
    *   *Exception*: For developer products, GitHub OAuth is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>.
*   **One-Email Wonders**: Overstressing about a single email's impact on a customer group is futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. One-off emails rarely work or cause significant lift due to low open and click rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. Email should be thought of as a "series" or "whole strategy" interacting with product communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.
*   **Obsession with Removing Friction**: While fixing "horrible friction" (e.g., confusing steps, high cognitive load) is necessary, simply removing steps or oversimplifying to the point of losing product identity is a "completely failed growth tactic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.
    *   For instance, "simplified onboarding" should never be a line item on a roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. Simplifying is a solution, not a problem itself. The actual problem is user confusion, getting lost, or lacking education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>.

These tactics, often mistaken for "growth hacks," frequently lead to wasted time and resources without materializing into meaningful growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Recommended Growth Frameworks

While there are no "shortcuts" in growth, there are powerful frameworks that serve as patterns and starting points for ideation, helping to shortcut the path to potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>:

1.  **Growth Loops**: This framework emphasizes thinking about action-reaction cycles that generate another action, creating a self-contained flywheel for sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. Reforge, Brian Balfour, Casey Winters, and Andrew Chen have written extensively on this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>.
2.  **Race Car Framework**: Developed by Lenny and Dan, this framework helps organize and understand different growth initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>. It categorizes initiatives into:
    *   **Engines/Loops**: Sustained spinning components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>.
    *   **Fuel**: Inputs like paid marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>.
    *   **Turbo Boosts**: Large, impactful events like user conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.
    *   **Lubrications/Optimizations**: Ongoing efforts to ensure correct performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.
3.  **Adjacent User Theory**: From Balaji Srinivasan, this framework is powerful for considering growth evolution and expanding the product's reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>. It focuses on how growth teams can bring in "adjacent users" (those outside the ideal customer profile or core user) and optimize their experiences, leading to product growth without necessarily expanding core product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>.

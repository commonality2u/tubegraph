Kevin Wheel, Chief Product Officer at OpenAI, emphasizes that the AI models available today are the "worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective highlights the unprecedented pace of technological advancement, where computers can do something new every two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This rapid evolution fundamentally reshapes how product development is approached and what skills are critical for success.

## [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | AI's Impact on Product Development]]

Unlike traditional technology, where the underlying tools are relatively stable, AI technology is constantly evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This requires product teams to completely rethink their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

Key shifts in product development with AI include:
*   **Fuzzy Inputs and Outputs** Traditional computer systems rely on defined inputs for defined outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Large Language Models (LLMs), however, excel at understanding the nuances of human language (fuzzy inputs) and produce varied, though spiritually similar, outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. This means product builders must deeply understand how accurate a model is for a specific use case (e.g., 60% vs. 95% vs. 99.5% accuracy) to design the right product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **Model Maximalism and Iterative Deployment** OpenAI operates with a "model maximalism" philosophy, anticipating that a better model will emerge in two months, blowing away current limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. This encourages developers to continue building even if a product is on the edge of current model capabilities, as future improvements will make it "sing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. The approach is to ship early and often, learning and iterating in public alongside society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **Planning vs. Plans** While quarterly roadmapping and year-long strategies exist, the rapid change in technology means plans are often discarded halfway through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. The value lies in the "planning" process itself, which allows teams to assess progress, learn, and check dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **Bottoms-Up Approach** OpenAI emphasizes a strong bottoms-up approach to product development, empowering passionate engineers, product managers, and designers to build products with strong opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. This allows for rapid movement and acceptance of mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.
*   **API Focus** OpenAI's focus on building a robust API stems from the belief that there are far more smart people and use cases outside the company than within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. This allows millions of developers to leverage AI for industry and vertical-specific applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

### Evals
A core skill for product managers and builders in the AI era is the ability to write "evals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **What are Evals?** Evals are like quizzes or tests for an AI model, gauging its knowledge or capability in a specific area (e.g., creative writing, graduate-level science, competitive coding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. They act as benchmarks for model intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   **Importance of Evals** Evals are crucial because they determine how reliable a model is for a given use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. They also enable a continuous learning process, allowing teams to fine-tune models to get better at specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. The full potential of AI models is, to some degree, "capped" by the quality of evals and the data available for training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

### [[impact_of_ai_on_product_roles | Impact of AI on Product Roles]] and Team Structure
OpenAI's approach to team structure reflects the unique demands of AI development:
*   **PM-Light Organizations** OpenAI runs with a relatively small number of Product Managers (around 25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. This philosophy aims to prevent micromanagement and empower engineers to make decisions, requiring product-focused engineers with high agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.
*   **PM Qualities** Ideal PMs at OpenAI are high-agency, comfortable with massive ambiguity, ready to execute quickly, and skilled at leading through influence given the self-directed nature of research teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. Decisiveness is also a critical trait for a PM in this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.
*   **Research Integration** The future of product teams, even outside foundation model companies, will likely see researchers or "quasi-researcher/machine learning engineer types" integrated into every product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>. This is because fine-tuning models will become a core workflow for building most products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. The best products emerge when product design and research work together as a single team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.
*   **Fine-tuned Models and Ensembles** Product teams will increasingly use fine-tuned modelsâ€”teaching a model to be better at specific tasks by providing many examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>. They will also utilize "ensembles of models," breaking down complex problems into specific tasks and using different specialized models (some fine-tuned, some of different sizes for varying latency/cost requirements) for each, then combining their outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

AI is already impacting daily workflows for engineers and PMs:
*   **Daily AI Usage** OpenAI's employees extensively use AI for summarizing and writing documents, and even for generating evals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.
*   **"Vibe Coding"** A significant shift is "vibe coding," a term coined by Andrej Karpathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>. This involves using AI coding assistants (like Cursor, Warp, GitHub Copilot) to generate code rapidly by accepting suggestions, pasting errors, and continuing to generate, largely letting the model drive the process for quick proofs of concept and demos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This represents a move from static designs (e.g., Figma) to interactive prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>.

## AI and Creativity

AI is not replacing creativity but augmenting it:
*   **Enhanced Output** Tools like Image Gen allow individuals with no artistic skill to generate creative outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Similarly, Sora, a video generation model, enables film directors to rapidly generate 50 different variations of a cut scene, accelerating the brainstorming and refinement process before final production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.
*   **Broadening Reach** AI helps creatives explore more possibilities and achieve better final results, making high-quality creative work more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

## Broader Societal Outlook

Kevin Wheel maintains a strong optimistic view on technology's role in societal advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>. While acknowledging potential temporary dislocations and individual impacts from AI, he stresses the importance of societal support during this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

*   **Reskilling and Education** Chat GPT is seen as an excellent "reskilling app" for individuals interested in learning new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>. Personalized AI tutoring is highlighted as one of the most important potential applications, offering "multiple standard deviation improvements in learning speed" and the potential to revolutionize education globally, especially given its free accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.
*   **Future Trajectory** The rapid advancements in AI, with models becoming smarter, faster, cheaper, and safer (less hallucination) at an exponential rate far exceeding Moore's Law, indicate a future vastly different from today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>. The core takeaway remains: the AI models used today are the worst ones ever to be experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.

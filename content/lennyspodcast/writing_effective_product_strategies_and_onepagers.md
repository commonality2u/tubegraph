Maggie Crowley, currently Vice President of Product at Toast, has an extensive background in product leadership, including roles at Charlie Health, Drift, BevSpot, and TripAdvisor, and an MBA from Harvard Business School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. She emphasizes practical approaches to product management, including how to effectively write and communicate product strategies and one-pagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Core Principles for Effective Product Documentation

Effective product documentation, whether it's a strategy or a one-pager, hinges on clarity, focus, and a deep understanding of the context. These documents are crucial for centering the team and driving results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:07">[0:51:07]</a>.

### Simplifying Complex Information
A key trait of the best product managers is their ability to simplify complex information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This means identifying the single most important thing to focus on, especially amidst numerous priorities and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
Simplification also means:
*   **Prioritization**: The job of a PM can be boiled down to prioritizing and defining what comes next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. This involves not only choosing the right thing but also having the resilience to stick with it until it's finished and working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **Concise Writing**: Read your writing out loud to identify overly complicated or nonsensical sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:55">[0:11:55]</a>. The goal is to "just say that" â€“ write exactly what you would say in a conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:35">[0:12:35]</a>.
*   **The Minto Pyramid Principle**: Always put the conclusion or headline first, followed by supporting arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:26">[0:18:26]</a>. Avoid unnecessary build-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:49">[0:18:49]</a>.
*   **Rule of Three**: Limit strategies, conclusions, or next steps to a maximum of three points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:32">[0:14:32]</a>.
*   **Cut Excess**: Generally, the first two paragraphs of almost any document can be deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:08">[0:19:08]</a>.
*   **Seek Feedback**: Find peers who can review your work and help you simplify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:39">[0:19:39]</a>. Product leaders often have informal groups for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:50">[0:19:50]</a>.

### The Importance of Impact and Accountability
[[balancing_output_and_impact_in_product_management_roles | Driving impact]] is paramount for a PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:33">[0:10:33]</a>. While strategy is important, it's only a small slice of the work; the ability to ship more, get more "reps," and actually create impact is what makes a PM great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:16">[0:10:16]</a>.
*   **"Carrying the Water"**: A great PM is willing to do the "hard, boring, unglamorous work" like customer support, sales, marketing, and QA. This willingness to do whatever it takes ensures product success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:05">[0:09:05]</a>. If you ever find yourself saying "that's not my job," it's probably something you should do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:00:00">[0:00:00]</a>.
*   **"When in Doubt, It's Your Job"**: Unlike engineers (who write code) or designers (who design solutions), a PM's job is to deliver a business result. They are uniquely positioned to fill any gaps because no one else is incentivized to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:29:12">[0:29:12]</a>.
*   **Ownership**: As a PM, you must be willing to make bets and take responsibility for them, even if there's a chance they won't work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:16:11">[0:16:11]</a>.

### Following Up on Results
Truly effective PMs remember to follow up on the results of their initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:00">[0:08:00]</a>. This means setting reminders to check metrics weeks or months after launch and sharing these results with relevant stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:22:06">[0:22:06]</a>. This practice not only helps managers see your effectiveness but also allows you to learn why something succeeded or failed, making you better with every ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:56">[0:23:56]</a>.

## Developing a Product Strategy Document

A product strategy document provides a comprehensive overview of the context, current state, and proposed direction for a product or business area. It helps address feedback like "you need to be more strategic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:35:10">[0:35:10]</a>. This document is primarily for the PM's own clarity and confidence in their decisions, which then enables transparent communication with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:43:01">[0:43:01]</a>.

A typical structure includes:
1.  **Mission**:
    *   What is the mission/point of the company? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:05">[0:36:05]</a>
    *   What are our goals? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:05">[0:36:05]</a>
2.  **Landscape**:
    *   What's going on with the business and products? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:14">[0:36:14]</a>
    *   Point of view on the market, competitors, SWOT analysis, and key risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:19">[0:36:19]</a>.
    *   Current business goals for the quarter/planning period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:30">[0:36:30]</a>.
    *   This section aims to put all contextual information on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:30">[0:36:30]</a>.
3.  **Current State ("Where are we?")**:
    *   An honest accounting of the product's current state, overall business, and specific area you're working in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:47">[0:36:47]</a>.
    *   What works and what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:51">[0:36:51]</a>.
    *   Customer feedback, user insights, support tickets, and team feedback (bottoms-up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:58">[0:36:58]</a>.
    *   Technical hurdles, significant tech debt, and upcoming technical changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:37:04">[0:37:04]</a>.
4.  **Opportunity**:
    *   From the landscape and current state, identify the top one or two opportunities for your team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:37:33">[0:37:33]</a>.
    *   Where can you play and win, based on your unique competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:37:37">[0:37:37]</a>.
5.  **Challenges**:
    *   What are the hardest aspects of pursuing the identified opportunity? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:37:55">[0:37:55]</a>
    *   What must be true about the world for this strategy to work? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:37:59">[0:37:59]</a>
6.  **Proposed Solution ("What would you do?")**:
    *   Outline your proposed solution, what needs to be built, and how it might work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:38:06">[0:38:06]</a>.
    *   Limit this to a maximum of three core ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:38:12">[0:38:12]</a>.
7.  **Plan**:
    *   If no one else had an opinion, how would you sequence the work? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:38:18">[0:38:18]</a>
    *   Consider team structure, resources, and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:38:31">[0:38:31]</a>.

This document, though potentially long (up to 20 pages with screenshots and detailed analyses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:41:43">[0:41:43]</a>, should always begin with a concise summary to allow quick understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:41:55">[0:41:55]</a>. It serves as a transparent, shareable logic chain from company mission to individual priorities, enabling focused discussions and critical evaluation of existing roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:38:40">[0:38:40]</a>.

## The Product One-Pager (Spec/PRD)

The product one-pager (also known as a spec or PRD) is a PM's primary artifact used to define what a product team is building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:50:03">[0:50:03]</a>. When done well, it serves as a central point for the team and stakeholders.

Key sections of a one-pager:
1.  **Background and Context**:
    *   What is the problem? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:50:57">[0:50:57]</a>
    *   Why does it matter? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:01">[0:51:01]</a>
    *   Crucially, **why does it matter *now***? This element helps justify urgency and focus on perishable opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:01">[0:52:01]</a>.
2.  **Running List of Decisions**: Maintain an ongoing record of decisions made, what was decided against, and links to supporting artifacts or research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:36">[0:51:36]</a>.

The initial sections are the most important as they center the team around the problem and its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:50:51">[0:50:51]</a>. Like strategy documents, one-pagers should be shared with the team, particularly engineering and design counterparts, for critical feedback before moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:21">[0:52:21]</a>. A PM must not be precious about their work and should welcome others to "shred it" to make it better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:43">[0:52:43]</a>.

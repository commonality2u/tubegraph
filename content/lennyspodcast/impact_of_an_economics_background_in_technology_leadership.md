Elizabeth Stone, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Netflix, holds a PhD in economics and believes she may be the first economist to hold a CTO position at a Fortune 500 company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Her background provides a unique perspective in technology leadership, and she anticipates seeing more economists rise within tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.

## Economics as a "Flavor of Data Science"

Elizabeth Stone views economics as a distinct "flavor of data science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>. It offers a specific set of technical skills and a unique way of framing and solving complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:59">[01:06:59]</a>. She considers it complementary to other versions of data science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.

Economics is generally valuable for addressing a variety of challenges, particularly in a business context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>. It helps simplify problems, making them feel more tractable and manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>. This perspective, though perhaps not explicitly recognized by others at Netflix, is deeply ingrained in her thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. Since her transition to tech, it has become increasingly common for companies to recognize the value of economists on their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>.

## Practical Applications in Leadership

A key benefit of an economics background in leadership is the ability to understand incentives and anticipate unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>. This applies to:
*   **Internal Leadership:** Clarifying priorities, motivating the company, and defining problems to be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **External Strategy:** Considering Netflix's relationship with consumers and its competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.

The economic perspective helps to differentiate between rational thought processes and the potential, unexpected consequences of incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>. This way of thinking is useful for [[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking | planning ahead]] and analyzing cause-and-effect relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:58">[01:09:58]</a>.

## Role in Communication and Translation

Elizabeth Stone's early training at Analysis Group involved communicating complex quantitative work to non-technical audiences, such as judges and juries in economic cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This experience helped her develop communication fluency, enabling her to translate between technical and non-technical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>. This skill has been a significant advantage in her career, particularly as she advanced into roles requiring strong [[effective_leadership_and_strategic_thinking | communication fluency]] across different business functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>. This ability is crucial for [[role_of_product_leaders | building partnerships]] and ensuring effective collaboration across diverse teams within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

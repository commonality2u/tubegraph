Shas Doshi shares three questions, plus a bonus, that he wished he had asked himself earlier in his [[career_growth_and_personal_development | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These reflections stem from a career he describes as "full of suffering," acknowledging a past lack of honesty with himself when answering important questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Question 1: Why Am I So Busy?
Shas Doshi spent most of his [[career_development_and advice | career]] as a Product Manager (PM) leader feeling stressed and busy, experiencing dissatisfaction despite hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. He realized this busyness led to stress-induced health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. While common productivity tips and tools are known among senior product professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, Doshi identifies an "immovable force" that overwhelms product leaders: scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. As a product professional's scope grows, no amount of efficiency or prioritization can prevent extreme busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

He found a solution to this problem only in the last three to four years of his 20-year product career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### The Problem with Annual Planning
Annual planning often consumes two to three months for high-level managers, filled with spreadsheets, meetings, dependencies, and stakeholder engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This process can lead to guilt, as it diverts time from supporting teams and making product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
A typical annual planning cycle involves:
*   Four to six weeks of rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   Presenting to executives who ask predictable questions about ambitious plans and resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   Publishing a plan with enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   Inevitably, customer escalations arise for features not in the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, leading to plan revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   By the end of February, the original plan is often forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

The common adage, "Plans are useless but planning is everything," is often cited without clear understanding, reinforcing unproductive cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### The Solution: A Real Product Strategy
Doshi discovered that a "real product strategy" — one that has pre-alignment with everyone — can significantly reduce the time spent on annual planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. At Stripe, he found that having such a strategy for a major product reduced his planning time to three days, while peers were still in weeks-long cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This approach allows for bending rules, like not filling out irrelevant templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

> "If you have a real product strategy... then a lot of this nonsense we tend to do with annual planning actually goes away." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>

A clear, aligned product strategy:
*   Eliminates many prioritization problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   Resolves planning issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   Provides a rigorous framework to handle sales or support escalations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

### The Impact of Poor Product Decisions
Another key reason for being busy is making poor product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Often, teams make decisions about features without clearly thinking through customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Instead, decisions are based on engineer availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

The "two-way door" metaphor (from Jeff Bezos, implying easily reversible decisions) is often misapplied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. While seemingly reversible at an executive level, for a PM leader, most such decisions are effectively one-way doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   Committing to a feature can take weeks to build and launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
*   At quarterly business reviews (QBRs), if adoption is low, PMs resort to "favorable anecdotes" instead of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   Sales counterparts might highlight continued challenges in winning deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   This often leads to commitments for "full-featured" additions, accumulating more work for features that perhaps shouldn't have been built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.

**Tactical Tip:** It is useful to pause for minutes, days, or even weeks before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. "Thinking is cheap," so more thinking, not less, is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

## Question 2: Do I Actually Have Good Taste?
Doshi initially operated in an environment at Google where strategy was dismissed as "for MBAs," with the focus solely on execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. He adopted this mantra, even discouraging a colleague who questioned his product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

His perspective shifted at Twitter after its IPO around 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Despite having incredible assets like the product, network effects, brand, and talent, Twitter was struggling to meet its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. He realized Twitter's biggest problem was a lack of a compelling, cohesive product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. This insight was further solidified at Stripe where he saw the greater value of a clear strategy for early-stage products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

### Redefining "Taste"
"Taste" in product is often associated with beautiful design and passion (like Steve Jobs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. However, Doshi realized taste also applies to the **beliefs** we choose to create within ourselves as product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>, which then dictate how we manage, lead, and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. He candidly admitted he lacked good taste in how he evaluated information, learned, and resonated with content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

True taste is the ability to identify what is truly good without needing to see its results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. It requires "game recognizing game" *before* the results are obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. Merely appreciating success after the fact, or being a "stuff grader" who dismisses everything, requires "zero taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

### Pitfalls in Developing Taste
Doshi identifies several common pitfalls that prevent developing good taste:
*   **Over-excitement about cool metaphors:** E.g., "two-way doors" versus "reversible/irreversible decisions." The catchy phrase overshadows the underlying idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   **Authority bias:** Adopting ideas just because a respected figure like Bezos said them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   **Impressions by alliterations:** E.g., "fail fast" versus "fail quickly." The alliteration makes an idea more appealing than its literal meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **Being impressed by complicated, incomprehensible charts and math:** Some leaders even use this as a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

**Tactical Tip:** To become a more critical thinker and develop better taste, one must shed these patterns and evaluate ideas separately from social proof, authority proof, or other external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. This is crucial for [[career_growth_and_personal_development | career growth and personal development]].

## Question 3: Why Does My Job Feel So Frustrating?
Despite loving his PM leadership job on a macro level, Doshi experienced daily frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. A key reason is the inherent loneliness of the PM leader role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. More broadly, frustration arises when individuals consistently operate in misalignment with their "superpowers" and core identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

Product work operates at three levels:
1.  **Impact:** The strategic, high-level thinking that drives significant results.
2.  **Execution:** The hands-on work of building and delivering.
3.  **Optics:** Managing perceptions, presentations, and corporate visibility.

Doshi realized his preferred level was "Impact," but as he ascended the corporate ladder, he increasingly had to spend time at the "Optics" level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. While possessing the willpower and skills for Optics, relying on finite willpower for prolonged periods in a non-preferred mode led to frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.

**Tactical Tip:** The solution lies in abandoning the "traditional path" of career progression driven by societal or external expectations (e.g., LinkedIn profiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. Instead, identify your superpowers and be true to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. Making [[career_development and planning | career development and planning]] decisions aligned with one's core strengths, rather than out of expectation or "LinkedIn envy," leads to better work, greater enjoyment, and reduced frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. This is central to [[understanding_personal_and_career_fulfillment | understanding personal and career fulfillment]] and [[leveraging_mindset_and_personal_growth_in_professional_settings | leveraging mindset and personal growth in professional settings]].

## Bonus Question: Am I Really Listening?
This was the hardest question for Doshi to address, as he believed he was a good listener through active techniques like recapping and eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. However, he realized there is an "entirely other level to listening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. Understanding this deeper level is crucial for becoming a world-class leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.

For resources on this deeper level of listening, he recommends exploring the perspectives of Rick Rubin, Dee Hock, and Peter Drucker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

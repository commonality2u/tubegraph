When discussing pricing, many people initially think only of dollar figures, which are merely price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, price should be understood as a measure of value, similar to how a liter measures volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Thinking of price this way helps determine if people truly want a product and are willing to buy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This concept is known as willingness to pay (WTP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Importance of Early Willingness to Pay Conversations

Entrepreneurs and companies should engage in WTP conversations much earlier in the product development process to ensure they are on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It's crucial to achieve a "product market pricing fit," not just product market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Without including pricing in product market fit validation, teams might only hear what they want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. WTP acts as a proxy for whether people truly value and want a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

A significant majority, 72%, of innovations fail from a commercial or monetization perspective because companies did not conduct early WTP checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. By conducting these checks early, companies can pivot their product strategy and build something more meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. The advice is to "price before product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, as companies don't have a choice *if* they'll have a pricing conversation, only *when* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. It's about testing and learning pricing and WTP, rather than postponing it to the very end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. There is no such thing as "too early" for this conversation; even when an idea is just being considered, WTP should be assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### Prioritizing the R&D Roadmap

A key takeaway is that product roadmaps cannot be prioritized effectively without WTP conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. Prioritizing based on internal feelings or technical resources is often incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. WTP allows prioritization based on what customers need, value, and are willing to pay for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Typically, 20% of what is built drives 80% of the WTP, aligning with the Pareto principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. Knowing this 20% allows product teams to focus on nailing those core features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

## Methods for Conducting Willingness to Pay Conversations

When having WTP conversations, directly asking "how much should I charge?" will yield unhelpful "garbage" answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Instead, nuanced approaches are required:

*   **Relative Framing**
    People are "meaningless" in absolute terms but "super smart" relatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Frame questions comparatively, e.g., for a B2B SaaS company, ask customers: "If Salesforce was indexed at 100 in value, where do you think we are?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. Then ask the same for pricing: "If Salesforce was indexed at 100 in pricing, where do you think we should be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. This provides meaningful information about perceived premiumness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

*   **Psychological Thresholds**
    After pitching the product's value (as in a sales and marketing conversation), ask customers about different price points:
    1.  What do you think is an **acceptable price** for this innovation? (Price where they love both the product and the price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>
    2.  What do you think is an **expensive price**? (Value-priced, neutral reaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>
    3.  What do you think is a **prohibitively expensive price**? (They would "laugh you out of the room") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>

    By doing this at scale, [[behavioral_pricing_strategies | psychological thresholds]] or "cliffs" in demand curves can be identified where prices suddenly become perceived as expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. Rahul Vora used this method to determine Superhuman's $30 price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. The key is to first prime customers with the product's benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

*   **Purchase Probability Questions**
    Instead of a simple "would you buy this product?", use a scale (e.g., 1-5, where 5 is "most likely" and 1 is "not at all interested") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. Even a "5" often means only 30-50% certainty of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. This helps understand demand curves and elasticities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.

*   **"Most and Least" Questions**
    To prioritize features for an R&D roadmap, instead of asking customers to rank 10 features (which is difficult due to a "messy middle"), present a subset (e.g., 6 out of 10) and ask them to identify the *most important* (must-have, willing to pay) and *least important* (don't need, won't pay) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. Repeating this with different subsets allows for relative prioritization of the entire feature set based on WTP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

*   **Trade-off Exercises**
    These advanced methods involve putting customers through realistic buying scenarios with different packaging and [[unique_pricing_and_product_adoption_strategies | pricing models]] (e.g., changing features and price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Observing their choices reveals their mental models and decision rules, providing precise data on price elasticity and market reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

It's crucial to ask "why" after customers respond to these questions, as this helps articulate the perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.

### Application Based on Company Stage
Different WTP methods are applicable at different stages:
*   **Early Stage (Idea):** Even asking "would you pay for this idea?" is a good start. If "no," ask why; if "yes," ask why to understand their perceived value for messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.
*   **Seed/Series A:** Purchase probability questions can provide quick answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.
*   **Late Stage Product/Company:** More rigorous trade-off exercises are needed for precise [[unique_pricing_and_product_adoption_strategies | pricing models]] and packaging strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

## Logistics of WTP Conversations

WTP conversations can be:
*   **One-on-one:** Especially for early-stage founders pitching an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.
*   **Cross-functional team conversations:** Product and sales teams collaborating, as seen at LinkedIn, where new innovations require booking a credit card or budget for pilot POCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
*   **Focus groups:** Bringing in a group of customers to mediate answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **Quantitative surveys:** For B2C companies with large customer bases, A/B testing or controlled surveys with thousands of responses provide statistically significant data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. For B2B SaaS with fewer, high-value accounts, aim to talk to 20-30 leading accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.

These conversations are typically part of a larger [[customer_interactions_and_productmarket_fit | customer development]] or [[understanding_and_executing_effective_product_positioning_strategies | product market fit]] discussion, often occurring at the end of a desirability discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. The goal is to see if customers' "eyes light up" when the product's solution to their needs is presented, followed by a WTP conversation to validate their commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

## Examples of Effective WTP Application

*   **Porsche Cayenne:** Before drawing a blueprint for their SUV, Porsche checked with the market if there was a need and WTP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Every feature was battle-tested with customers in "car clinics" using prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. This design-around-WTP approach led to the Cayenne accounting for over half of Porsche's profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Two-Sided Marketplace (Abstract):** Product teams for a buy-side monetization product prioritized 40 ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Testing wireframes and concepts with customers revealed that internally exciting features, like "highlight connections from Facebook," had low WTP and were not valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This allowed them to avoid building a disastrous product and prioritize effectively based on actual customer value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

## Revisiting Pricing Strategy

Companies should revisit their pricing strategy at least every six months and expect to make changes within 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. Key pivot points include introducing new plans or features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.

## WTP and Other Pricing Concepts

### [[segmentation_and_its_impact_on_product_pricing_strategy | Segmentation and its impact on product pricing strategy]]
Effective segmentation should be based on what customers need, value, and are willing to pay for, allowing for productization to different segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. It's crucial for companies to "act differently" (product teams, sales, marketing, finance) towards different segments, meaning tailoring products and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. Early-stage founders should use WTP conversations to identify and prioritize which segment to target first, rather than attempting a "one-size-fits-all" product that often "fits none" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.

### [[unique_pricing_and_product_adoption_strategies | The importance of pricing models in B2B SAS]]
The "how you charge" (the [[unique_pricing_and_product_adoption_strategies | pricing model]]) is often more important than the "how much you charge" (the price point) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. This is illustrated by Michelin charging truckers by the mile for tires, shifting from a per-tire model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. In B2B SaaS, Segment shifted from API-based pricing to monthly tracked users, aligning with how customers perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>. Testing pricing models can be done with break-even exercises, where economically indifferent options are rarely chosen, revealing customer preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

### [[behavioral_pricing_strategies | Behavioral pricing strategies]]
WTP conversations also inform [[behavioral_pricing_strategies | behavioral pricing strategies]], which tap into the irrational modes of decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>. This includes:
*   **Compromise Effect:** Offering three products (e.g., $49, $79, $149) and adjusting prices to nudge customers towards the middle option (e.g., making a $99 product look attractive next to a $299 decoy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. This can lead to significant revenue increases without product changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>.
*   **Pennies-a-Day Effect:** Framing pricing in smaller, more digestible units (e.g., "$1 per day" vs. "$30 per month") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>.
*   **Psychological Thresholds:** Identifying price points where demand drops steeply (e.g., crossing $99 to $101) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>. While some thresholds like $29 or $9.99 are common, specific product thresholds require testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>.

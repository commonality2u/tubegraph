Whiz, a cloud security company, achieved rapid growth, hitting $100 million ARR just 18 months after founding, making it the fastest-growing software company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:38">[01:36:38]</a>. This success is underpinned by a unique and robust company culture that prioritizes openness, trust, and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## An Open and Vulnerable Culture
Ros, Whiz's Chief Marketing Officer and VP of Product Strategy, was one of the first ten employees and the first product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Early on, the company's initial idea was not working, leading to a pivot six weeks after she joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Ros felt confused about what they were building, despite being the product manager, and ultimately found the courage to ask "what exactly are we doing here?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a> This question sparked a deep discussion that led to their successful pivot to cloud security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

This openness to vulnerability is a cornerstone of Whiz's [[governance_and_values_in_building_companies | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>:
*   **No Shame in Not Understanding** - If a company has the right [[building_and_maintaining_a_company_culture | culture]], it's not shameful to admit "I don't understand" or ask for further explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   **Flat Organization** - Whiz operates as a very flat organization, where seniority is less important than driving impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Voices are Heard** - Everyone is encouraged to have a seat at the table, and all voices are heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Ros credits the founding team for giving her the platform to express her confusion, demonstrating their openness to re-evaluate their direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **Embracing Vulnerability** - Ros views her ability to say "I don't understand" or "I don't know" as a learned quality that fosters vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

## Empowering Employees and Fostering Loyalty
The founding team's deep trust in each other, stemming from over 20 years of working together (including in the Israeli army and their previous company Adallom, which sold to Microsoft), creates a unique environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>. This trust extends to all employees, defining Whiz's [[building_and_maintaining_a_company_culture | company culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>:
*   **Impact Over Title** - Employees don't have to "work hard" to impact strategy or earn a seat at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>. Whiz has an open [[building_and_maintaining_a_company_culture | culture]] that gives everyone a chance to drive impact, regardless of title or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.
*   **Trust and Opportunity** - Leaders trust their employees and allow them to try new things, even if it means potential failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.
*   **Cultivating Loyalty** - This approach leads to significant employee loyalty, as everyone feels like a part of what is being built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. This fosters a very healthy and loyal [[building_and_maintaining_a_company_culture | company culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.

## Adapting to Hyperscaling
Even at 1,500 employees, Whiz continues to hyperscale while maintaining its authentic, flat, and enabling [[building_and_maintaining_a_company_culture | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. Ros highlights that Whiz is always hiring for passionate learners who want to make an impact, offering opportunities across all domains due to its rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

Mike Maples Jr., a renowned early-stage startup investor and founder of Floodgate, has extensively researched what separates breakthrough startups and founders from those that don't succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>. After reviewing thousands of startup notes and decks over two decades, he identified three key ways breakthrough founders "think differently" and "act differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:18">[01:43:18]</a>. The "acting differently" components include movements, [[how_to_construct_effective_and_memorable_stories|storytelling]], and disagreeableness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.

## Disagreeable Founders

Startups are inherently disagreeable acts, representing a disagreement with the status quo and how things are currently done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. This means founders must be willing to be disagreeable at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:44">[01:25:44]</a>.

### Breaking the Conformity Trap
A key aspect of disagreeableness is breaking free from the [[challenges_and_misconceptions_of_startup_success|conformity trap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a>. Society often pressures individuals to conform, preventing exploration beyond established limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:39">[01:24:39]</a>. Breakthrough founders are like "Jonathan Livingston Seagull," willing to pursue an obsession they believe must happen, even if it means sacrificing status or fitting in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. They recognize that to stand out and make a difference, one must be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:32">[01:25:32]</a>.

### Courage to Be Disliked
Successful founders often have the courage to be disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:15">[01:30:15]</a>. Before they win, their ideas might be dismissed as stupid or lonely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:18">[01:30:18]</a>. After they succeed, they might face criticism for breaking rules or being too powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:22">[01:30:22]</a>.

Examples of disagreeable founders:
*   **Ev Williams (Twitter):** Maples found that Williams often ignored his advice, but in a way that demonstrated a different, correct belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. Williams "listened and he understood what I thought the truth was, he just believed a different truth than I did" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>.
*   **Bill Gates:** Though history often portrays him differently, Gates was "not a warm and fuzzy dude" but a "hard ass" during his time at Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:29">[01:27:29]</a>. His high standards inspired great people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>.
*   **Elon Musk:** Known for high standards and not trying to "Win Friends and Influence People," Musk's focus is on audacious goals like landing on Mars, which necessitates disagreeableness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

### Internal Chaos
Internally, successful startups are often characterized by chaos and messiness, described as a "capitalist mutation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>. People argue about direction, and it's ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>. This messiness is a natural part of movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>.

## The Role of Storytelling

Founders need to persuade others to change their habits and adopt a new pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>. This is where [[how_to_construct_effective_and_memorable_stories|storytelling]] becomes crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>.

### World That Is vs. World That Could Be
Pattern-breaking founders create a stark dichotomy: the "world that is" (the current, problematic reality) and the "world that could be" (the radically different, desirable future) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. They then create an "irresistible desire" among early believers to move to that different future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.

### The Hero's Journey in Startups
[[how_to_construct_effective_and_memorable_stories|Storytelling]] for startups often follows the "hero's journey" archetype, but with a crucial twist: the founder is the mentor (Obi-Wan Kenobi), not the hero (Luke Skywalker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The early believers (customers, employees, investors) are the heroes whose journey the founder enables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **The World That Is:** Describing the existing problems and frustrations (e.g., taxis suck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.
2.  **The Call to Adventure:** Offering a new product or idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>.
3.  **Resistance and Mentorship:** Acknowledging the fear or resistance to change, and providing a "tool" or "magic" (the product/solution) to overcome it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.
4.  **Co-Conspirators:** Finding early believers who share the vision and are ready to move to the new future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>.
5.  **Transformation:** Showing how the heroes (users) will emerge transformed and successful in the "world that could be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>.

Examples of [[importance_of_storytelling_for_product_managers|storytelling]] and movement:
*   **Lyft:** The "pink mustache" on cars honored the resistance people felt about getting into a stranger's car, making it seem less scary and inviting curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. The story wasn't just about a better taxi, but a new way to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>.
*   **Twitter:** Instead of "microblogs Inc.," they created the metaphor of "tweeting birds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
*   **Tesla:** The Tesla Roadster wasn't bought for practical reasons (like comparing to a Porsche 911) but for aesthetic reasons â€“ to be part of a different, sustainable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. Their mission statement "accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy" doesn't even mention cars, focusing on a higher purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>.
*   **Airbnb:** Brian Chesky created a movement around "living like a local" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. He didn't criticize hotels directly but highlighted their inherent weakness: providing a consistent experience everywhere. Airbnb offered a different, more authentic choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.

### Tailoring the Story
The story needs to be tailored to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>. The story for an investor (making money, being on a fancy list) is different from the story for an early customer (solving a business problem, gaining recognition), or an early employee (exciting work, awesome people, avoiding politics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. The founder's job is to meet people where they are and show them how they can embark on a transformational journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>.

### Common Mistakes in Pitching
A frequent mistake is talking about oneself (e.g., "We're Acme AI, funded by X and Y VCs") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>. This fails because the audience doesn't care about the founder yet; they care about how they will become a hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.

Instead, for [[fundraising_and_storytelling_for_startups|pitch decks]]:
*   **Slide 1: What you do simply.** State clearly what the company does, as if the audience knows nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.
*   **Slide 2: The non-obvious insight.** Articulate the core belief or insight that isn't widely accepted yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:29]</a>. If the audience doesn't believe this, nothing else matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a>.
*   **Slide 3: Proof points.** Provide any evidence, such as customers or talented [[attributes_of_successful_startup_founders|founders]], that validates the insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:48">[01:23:48]</a>.

Founders should avoid creating "Frankendecks" by trying to anticipate and address every objection from non-believers, as this obscures the core message for those who might be receptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>. The goal is to find the investors who are prepared to believe and ensure they clearly understand why they should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>.

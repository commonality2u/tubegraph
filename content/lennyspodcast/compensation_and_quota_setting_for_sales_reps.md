Setting up effective compensation plans and quotas for sales representatives is a critical aspect of [[hiring_and_scaling_a_sales_team | building and scaling a sales team]] in B2B SaaS, and it's an area where many founders make [[mistakes_founders_make_in_building_sales_teams | common mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. The goal is to ensure a win-win scenario where both the sales rep and the company are successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>.

## General Principles of Compensation

It's crucial to pay market rates for sales talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. Even if a founder is only making $60,000, a sales rep might expect On-Target Earnings (OTE) of $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. This can seem daunting, but it's important to break down the actual upfront cash commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>.

Typically, sales compensation is split 50/50 between base salary and bonus/commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This means a $140,000 OTE actually translates to a $70,000 base salary, with the rest earned through commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>. For the first few months, the company is only committing to the base salary, making the initial investment more manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. If a startup cannot find $20,000 to invest in sales, it shouldn't be doing sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>.

A key principle is that a sales rep must generate more revenue than they take home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. Salespeople should also genuinely enjoy the "craft" of sales and be motivated by money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

## Early-Stage Sales Compensation

In the very early days, the focus should be on getting reps to close deals and generate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

*   **Initial Period (First 3 Months)**: For the first three months, a new rep might be allowed to keep 100% of what they close in commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. This is an investment by the business, as it's not profitable, but it helps the rep quickly put "supper on the stove" and build momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>.
*   **Ramp Period**: This aggressive commission structure should last for a maximum of one quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>. Extending it longer can make mediocre reps too comfortable and does not help them in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

## Quota Setting and Performance Expectations

Ultimately, a sales rep should bring in four to five times what they take home (their total compensation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

*   **Multiplier**:
    *   3x for small businesses (SMB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>
    *   4x for mid-market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>
    *   5x or more for enterprise deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>

[!INFO]+ Key Financial Principle
If a rep makes $150,000 and closes $450,000 (3x), this should make the company happy, assuming marketing costs are reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>. The company should want reps to make a lot of money, as it means the company is also making a lot of money and the equity is becoming more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

### Common Misconceptions

*   **Over-negotiating OTE**: Founders often panic about the OTE number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>. Negotiating a rep down from $150,000 to $130,000 OTE makes little difference if the goal is for them to close $600,000 or $700,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. The focus should be on the total revenue generated, not just the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.
*   **Frequent Revisions**: Once a sales compensation plan is well-designed, it shouldn't need to be revisited for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. Minor tweaks are acceptable, but if significant changes are constantly needed, it indicates a fundamental flaw, and it's like trying to plug a leaky boat with no point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Hiring Too Many Reps**: In the early days, it's better to have fewer, more effective reps than many struggling ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. It's preferable to have two reps each closing $2 million than 20 reps struggling to close $100,000 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. Culturally, this creates misery and lack of domain knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>. Leads are precious in the early days, and wasting them on ineffective reps can doom the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

[!WARNING]+ Be Wary of Non-Performing Reps
When a lot of reps are not closing deals, especially coupled with high marketing costs, the customer acquisition cost (CAC) and payback period metrics will break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>. If a hire doesn't work out quickly (e.g., within six months), it's a tragedy for both the company and the individual, who isn't finding success in that environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.

Resilience is a core theme in the world of startups, with seasoned professionals like Dalton Caldwell, managing director and group partner at Y Combinator, emphasizing its critical role. It boils down to a simple, pragmatic message: "Just don't die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## The "Don't Die" Mantra

Dalton Caldwell's mantra, "just don't die, just keep your startup going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, reflects a fundamental truth in the startup journey. Even for the most successful athletes, constant coaching and reminders of the basics are essential for maintaining the right mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Similarly, for startup founders, this simple affirmation to keep going and perform "high quality reps" is often the most impactful advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The underlying theme across countless successful startup stories is that founders often should have rationally given up at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For example, the founders of [[Challenges and strategies in startup growth | Airbnb]] should have shut down "three or four times" before YC, as their venture "objectively wasn't working" and was "ruining their lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Their decision to persist was "a purely irrational act" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This highlights the need for an "irrational intention to keep going" even when facing defeat and external validation that things aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Many founders experience "near-death experiences" before achieving "overnight success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## When to Give Up vs. Keep Going

Deciding when to [[Overcoming startup failures and challenges | give up]] is a nuanced question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Dalton offers practical guidance:

*   **Are you still having fun?** If you still enjoy what you're doing, spending time with co-founders, and genuinely love your customers and product, leaning towards "keep going" is often the right choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Is it profoundly affecting you negatively?** If the startup is damaging your relationships, mental health, or you no longer want to work with your co-founder, it might be time to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Fear of failure:** Founders often worry about "losing face" if they shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. However, in 10 or 20 years, people likely won't remember you shutting down your company, provided you maintained integrity and honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Life is short, and forcing yourself to work on something that makes you miserable just to avoid losing face is a significant opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### The Illusion of Universal Struggle

Founders often compare themselves to others, leading to a sense of isolation when things are difficult. A common scenario at YC is when a batch of founders feels like "everyone is struggling" and "nobody is doing well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Dalton shared the story of the Winter 2017 batch:

*   **Vyond (later Brex):** Started as a VR headset company, founders were ashamed of their idea, felt "despondent" and considered shutting down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. They were seen as the "worst company" in the batch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. They later pivoted to [[Challenges in early startup growth and product pivots | Brex]] and became a decacorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Cashew (later Retool):** A PTP Venmo competitor in the UK, also "going really poorly and not growing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. They pivoted to [[Challenges in early startup growth and product pivots | Retool]], another highly successful company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

Ironically, the companies that "objectively seemed the worst" in the middle of the batch became the most successful in retrospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This illustrates that feelings of struggle are normal. "Every single startup goes through a point where they feel like all hope is lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. In fact, Dalton argues that "100% of the time," founders will have a near-death experience where they question if it's all over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

## Causes of Startup Failure

While many founders fear running out of money, Dalton contends that this is "more rare than Founders think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. The most common cause of failure is founders losing hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

> [!info] The Real Reason Startups Fail
> "It's much more common that they still have some money left... and they're just like, yeah, I'm done, I'm out of ideas, I don't want to do this anymore... it's way more common that they like their idea doesn't work and they have a big fight with their co-founder and then they can't agree on what to work on and then they just like are like I don't want to do this anymore and they shut down. That is the most common cause of death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.

As long as founders refuse to accept failure, there are usually "a lot more moves" they can try to save the company, such as pivoting, getting profitable, or launching a new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.

## [[Attributes of successful startup founders | Traits of Resilient Founders]]

While personality types vary greatly among successful founders (e.g., Tony from DoorDash, Rul from Zip, Patrick from Stripe, Ryan from Flexport) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>, a common thread is their unwavering desire and belief in themselves.

> "The thing that I would argue folks that build really big companies have in common is they just really want it and they really believe in themselves and they really believe they can make it work and that there somehow deep in their internal psyche there's something that's like I'm the one and I won't take I won't accept this not working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

This deep-seated conviction allows them to "warp the world to bend to that will," convincing employees and others that their vision will succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. This internal belief is not present in the early stages when a product isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. Instead, conviction builds over time: "The better the product does, the more obsessed you get with your own company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. This creates a "network effect virtual cycle" where data and customer feedback reinforce belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.

### The Long Game

Observing successful individuals like Reed Hoffman and Sam Altman, Dalton notes their "staying power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>. They were "bought in to staying working on internet companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a> and have reinvented themselves across multiple eras and careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>. This highlights that a career is long, with opportunities for many different ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. The key is to leverage personal skills and strengths, not necessarily conform to a specific personality type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.

Ultimately, Dalton advises founders to "just check in with yourself that you're having fun" and "enjoy what you're doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>. If not, it's time to make a change. This self-reflection is crucial for deciding the direction of one's life and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

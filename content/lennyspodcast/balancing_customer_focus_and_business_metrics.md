Balancing customer focus with business metrics is crucial for product success. While immediate metrics might sometimes seem to diverge from customer needs, ultimately, [[importance_of_product_metrics_and_how_to_choose_them | customer value and company value align]] in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>.

## Aligning Teams and Goals

To effectively balance customer focus and business metrics, it's essential to set up clear goals and incentives for teams.

### Avoiding "Toddler Soccer"
When teams are all given the same broad goal, such as "get revenue" or "get GMV," it can lead to "toddler soccer," where everyone "runs to the same surface or the same customer set or the same exact product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. This causes teams to trip over each other, lacking coordination and hindering progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

### Decoupling Goals
Instead of broad, singular goals, it's beneficial to:
*   **De-tangle objectives** By thinking about the customer journey and how individual teams can contribute, goals can be decoupled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.
*   **Assign different metrics** Each team should have a different goal that "ladders into a goal framework" for the overall customer impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. This prevents overlap and allows teams to make progress in their own lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>.
*   **Focus on Input Metrics** Instead of solely optimizing for an output metric like GMV, teams can be motivated by the underlying input metrics that lead to that output, such as the number of visitors, conversions, or reorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.
*   **Connect to Customer Problems** Regardless of the specific metric, it must solve a customer problem and be reflected in the company's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.

### Navigating Disagreements
Teams will naturally have different incentives and information, leading to disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>. This is a sign of "healthy tension and knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. It's crucial to acknowledge these differences and agree on the ultimate customer outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. When there's agreement on the overall goal, disagreements become conversations about the best way to achieve it using diverse information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.

## Prioritizing the Customer

Ultimately, success in product development comes down to focusing on the customer.

### Advocating for the User
Product professionals should prioritize understanding and advocating for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. While there are many distractions, such as team alignment or roadmaps, staying connected to the customer is "such a shortcut to everything else you need to do to be successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>.

### Long-Term Alignment
It is "very rare for customer value to be different than company value on a long enough time Horizon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. To create value for customers, the business must be sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. Therefore, metrics should consistently be about long-term customer impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. By focusing on the customer's needs, happiness, and value, businesses can achieve both customer success and company success.

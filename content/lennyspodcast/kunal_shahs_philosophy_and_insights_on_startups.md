From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Kunal Shah is a renowned entrepreneur and product leader, known for his deep insights into product, business, and life, often drawing from his background in philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. He is the CEO and founder of Cred, a fintech startup in India valued at over $6 billion, which processed over 20% of all credit card bill payments in India as of a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Prior to Cred, he founded three other startups, including FreeCharge, which was sold for over $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Core Frameworks and Philosophies

### The Delta 4 Framework

Kunal Shah developed the "Delta 4 framework" to assess product efficiency, a concept he devised during his philosophical quest to understand what makes things successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. This framework posits that for a product to be truly impactful and achieve breakout success, its efficiency must be at least four points higher than the existing solution on a 1-10 scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

Key characteristics of a Delta 4 product:
*   **Irreversible** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>: Once experienced, users rarely revert to the old way. For example, the efficiency of Uber compared to traditional cabs is a Delta 4 improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   **High Tolerance for Failure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>: Users show high tolerance if the product occasionally fails because the baseline improvement is so significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   **Unique Bragworthy Proposition (UBP)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>: Users cannot stop talking or sharing about it, leading to natural, often zero-cost, customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. This contrasts with products where the "Delta" is less than four, which are reversible, rarely bragged about, and have zero tolerance for failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

> "Every time you see that the product efficiency Delta is greater than equal to four, three things happen...it is irreversible, second is that you have very high tolerance for it to fail...and the third thing is that I call it the ubp, unique brag worthy proposition so every time humans unlock a Delta 4 product or service they cannot stop talking or sharing about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

### The Archetypes of Leadership: Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu

Drawing from Indian mythology, Kunal Shah describes three archetypes of leaders:
*   **Brahma (Creator)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>: The God of Creation, representing founders who create new companies or products.
*   **Shiva (Destroyer)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>: The God of Destruction, also associated with founders who are willing to destroy existing structures to innovate and rebuild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, is described as playing the Shiva role during Meta's recent changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:28:00">[36:28:00]</a>.
*   **Vishnu (Sustainer)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>: The God of Sustenance, representing CEOs who maintain and scale existing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. Indian CEOs in the US are particularly successful in this role because they follow the "Dharma" (principles) of the founders, sustaining and growing the company without diluting its core values or seeking personal identity through drastic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. This aligns with Jim Collins' "Level 5 leadership" concept, where leaders prioritize the business over personal legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.

Within the Vishnu archetype, he further classifies:
*   **Rama**: High on values, high on obedience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>. Follows principles and scales them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.
*   **Krishna**: High on values, low on obedience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>. Known as a "naughty God," capable of creation while still adhering to core values (Dharma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>.

Many successful Indian CEOs are adept at shifting between the Krishna and Rama archetypes as needed, consistently evolving and growing their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. This cyclical nature of creation, sustenance, and destruction is seen as an inevitable part of evolution in business, similar to the Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh cycles in Indian mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>.

### Wealth as Stored Energy

Kunal Shah holds a contrarian view that wealth is fundamentally the "storage of energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>. He argues that wealth is not zero-sum because energy is constantly being found and converted to human advantage. Humans are the only species to have harnessed various forms of energy (kinetic, fuel, solar, sound), leading to disproportionate wealth creation since the Industrial Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. Technologies like AI and nuclear fusion are expected to further increase this capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. He believes that chasing wealth equality is a "bad idea" and that allowing individuals to pursue wealth can ultimately create enough for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.

## Insights on the Indian Startup Ecosystem

### DAUs vs. ARPUs: The Indian Market Reality

India presents a unique market dynamic where it's easy to gain Daily Active Users (DAUs) but challenging to achieve high Average Revenue Per User (ARPUs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Low ARPU**: This is a direct function of the country's per capita income, which is relatively low (e.g., $2,500 per year average) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **High DAU Potential**: India offers cheap data and high smartphone penetration, making it a "user growth farm" for global companies that seek to boost valuations through user numbers, even if monetization is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on Product Strategy**: Indian founders who copy Western models expecting high ARPUs often make a mistake, as they will likely need to expand abroad to find sufficient revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Products that require payment for content, like Netflix or Spotify, face challenges due to the abundance of free content and the low perceived value of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

A unique cultural factor is that "no Indian has ever been paid an hourly salary in their entire life," leading to a different concept of the value of time. This makes paying for "time" (e.g., convenience services, subscriptions) harder for Indian consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Additionally, many Indian languages lack a direct word for "efficiency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### The Paradox of Low Trust and Super Apps

Developing nations like India are "low trust markets" because institutions are not strong enough to protect consumers from bad company behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This lack of institutional trust leads to a "concentration of trust" in established brands or individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   **Super Apps and Super Companies**: As a result, super apps (like WeChat in China) and diversified conglomerates (like Tata in India) thrive because consumers trust a single entity to provide a wide range of services or products (e.g., salt to cars to jewelry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Brand Importance**: Brand is exponentially more critical in India, where trust often stems from the reputation of individuals behind the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Focus is a Curse**: Unlike Western advice to "focus," in low-ARPU, low-trust markets, focus can be a curse. Companies need to do "many things" to monetize users and leverage concentrated trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### Risk Aversion and the Social Cost of Failure

Long-term oriented societies, like India, are naturally more risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Social Stigma of Failure**: A failed founder in India faces significant social repercussions, including difficulty in arranged marriages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This high social cost constrains the appetite for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Celebration for Risk-Takers**: Unlike countries where explorers (risk-takers) are honored like royalty (e.g., Portugal), India does not yet widely celebrate risk-takers or 0-to-1 innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   **Changing Landscape**: This is slowly changing, with founders gaining respect, unicorns being celebrated, and the establishment of a National Startup Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. However, large-scale failures and layoffs in the startup world are still often national news, reflecting the cultural difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Opportunities

The biggest challenges and opportunities in India are often the same:
*   **Female Labor Participation**: Low female labor participation is a challenge but also an opportunity, particularly with AI and remote work, to create new businesses and opportunities for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Per Capita Income & AI**: Low per capita income is a challenge, but AI can make people "brighter" by providing accessible expertise, potentially creating a more equal world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. However, AI could also lead to a "jobless world" if inefficiency, currently the "largest employer," is removed too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **Young Demographics**: India has a very young, well-positioned demographic with access to technology and hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. The challenge lies in being the first generation truly learning entrepreneurship and risk, and the need to avoid retreating into a shell after large-scale failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

Despite challenges, India remains a promising market due to digital public infrastructure, government support, and a vibrant ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## Founder Evolution and Mindset

### From 0 to 1 to 10 to 100: The Founder's Journey

The [[lessons_from_successful_founders_and_startups | lessons from successful Founders and startups]] for building a company from 0 to 1 are different from scaling it from 10 to 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:00">[34:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:56:00">[34:56:00]</a>. Founders must evolve, and the organization may need to be "gentrified" to integrate new perspectives and maintain reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:00">[35:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:14:00">[35:14:00]</a>.

Founders are "uncertainty absorbers" for employees, investors, and customers, and are rewarded for removing uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:23:00">[35:23:00]</a>. However, as a company scales, the expectation for stability significantly increases, requiring founders to adapt their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:39:00">[35:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:57:00">[35:57:00]</a>.

### Curiosity as a Catalyst for Adaptation

Curiosity is vital for continuous growth and adaptation. A curious person constantly demonstrates that they are not proud of their expertise and shows excitement when faced with problems they don't know how to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:59:00">[47:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:02:00">[48:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:04:00">[48:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:10:00">[48:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:12:00">[48:12:00]</a>. Insecurity, conversely, often leads people to demonstrate expertise rather than curiosity, slowing down compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:44:00">[48:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:46:00">[48:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:50:00">[48:50:00]</a>.

> "A curious person is somebody who's constantly demonstrated demonstrating that they are not proud of their expertise and they will demonstrate extraordinary amount of excitement when they face a problem which they have no clue how to solve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:59:00">[47:59:00]</a>.

Curiosity drives adaptation, a crucial trait for long-lasting species and successful companies. Lessons from animals that have survived for hundreds of millions of years include:
1.  **Ability to reduce metabolism at will**: Analogous to companies being able to "slow down" and survive during crises like COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:37:00">[49:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42:00">[49:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:04:00">[50:04:00]</a>.
2.  **High conversion rate on every attempt to secure food**: Represents high judgment and selectivity, making each pursuit count (e.g., a predator's deadly bite) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:17:00">[50:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:22:00">[50:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:34:00">[50:34:00]</a>.
3.  **Survival through adaptation to environmental changes**: This ability to change quickly comes from curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:42:00">[50:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:51:00">[50:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:09:00">[51:09:00]</a>.

Curiosity leads to gathering and connecting "dots" of information, creating "information asymmetry" which is a basis for wealth and competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:35:00">[51:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:36:00">[51:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:43:00">[51:43:00]</a>.

### Embracing Struggle and Learning from Failure

Failure is an inevitable part of any significant endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. Founders often have a unique ability to forget the "story" of failures but remember the "lesson" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>.

> "Entrepreneurs have this weird ability to forget about failures and almost turn that into a lesson that you hold and you forget the story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>.

It's crucial to learn from [[lessons_from_successful_founders_and_startups | other people's failures]] as well, rather than believing one is special and immune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>. Personal struggles, like a severe family financial crisis, can serve as powerful motivators, creating a "chip on the shoulder" that drives sustained effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. This "gift of struggle" is often something successful parents cannot pass on to their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.

### The Power of Second-Order Thinking

Second-order thinking is considered the most powerful trait for predicting success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. It involves correctly judging the "butterfly effect" of an event – understanding not just the immediate consequences but the ripple effects and subsequent outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>.

To cultivate second-order thinking:
*   **Question Choices**: Analyze how people with many choices make great decisions in their domain, even if they can't articulate their mental models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.
*   **"Why" Questions (Wi-Fi School)**: Encourage asking "why" questions about everything (e.g., "Why do humans wear jewelry?"), delving into history to understand origins and deeper principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.
*   **Origin Stories**: Investigate the origin stories of products and concepts (e.g., elevators, earphones, microphones) to understand the underlying motivations and evolutionary path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.
*   **Strategy Games**: Playing strategy games as a child has a strong correlation with developing second-order thinking, while physical games build rigor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.

He emphasizes that "all success comes from extraordinary amount of pain and struggle and hard work and there is no shortcut to anything material coming in life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. True self-love comes from continuous evolution, solving harder problems, and continually leveling up skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

### Advice for Founders

*   **Be an Uncertainty Absorber**: Founders need to provide stability and remove uncertainty for their stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Right Customers**: Understand market nuances, like income levels, and tailor products for specific customer segments, even if it means serving a smaller, more profitable group (as done with Cred) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>.
*   **Understand Profit Pools**: Do not blindly copy profit models from other countries. A country's "profit pools" reflect its values (e.g., patriarchal societies might have higher market caps in financial services than consumption) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:42:00">[36:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:46:00">[36:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:50:00">[36:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:54:00">[36:54:00]</a>.
*   **Seek Feedback from Those Who Have Done Better**: Filter criticism and only take feedback from individuals who have demonstrably performed better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:56:00">[43:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:00:00">[44:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:08:00">[44:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11:00">[44:11:00]</a>.
*   **Share Learnings**: Encourage sharing insights and learnings without fear of judgment, as it democratizes knowledge and helps others evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>.

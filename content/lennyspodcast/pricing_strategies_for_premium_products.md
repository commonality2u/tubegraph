Rahul Vora, founder and CEO of Superhuman, shares insights into his company's contrarian approach to pricing, emphasizing that effective pricing hinges on clear positioning and a deep understanding of customer perception. Superhuman charges $30 a month for email, a service typically free, and has even raised its prices, demonstrating a successful premium pricing model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>.

## Positioning Before Pricing

Vora asserts that before figuring out pricing, a company *must* first figure out its positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. Superhuman's positioning is rooted in being the best email tool on the market, built for high-performing teams and individuals, thereby serving the high end of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

> [!INFO] Superhuman's Value Proposition
> Superhuman has metrics to show its effectiveness:
> *   Users get through email twice as fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>.
> *   Responses are one to two days faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.
> *   Users save four hours or more every single week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>.
> A consulting firm corroborated these numbers, finding Superhuman saved their partners 3.3 hours per person per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:08">[01:24:08]</a>.

## The Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

After establishing positioning, Superhuman used the Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter, a method discussed in the book *Monetizing Innovation* by Madavan Roman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>. This method involves asking potential customers four key questions:

1.  **Too Expensive**: At what price would you consider the product so expensive that you would not consider buying it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>
2.  **Too Low**: At what price would you consider the product priced so low that you'd be worried about its quality and wouldn't buy it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>
3.  **Getting Expensive**: What price would you consider the product to be starting to get expensive so that it's not out of the question, but you'd have to give some thought to buying it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>
4.  **A Bargain**: At what price would you consider the product to be a bargain? A great buy for the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Choosing the Right Price Point
> Most startups often orient around price point number four (a bargain), especially for greenfield opportunities or marketplaces, aiming for maximum sign-ups at the top of the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>. However, for a premium product supporting a "best-in-class" position, the ideal price point is often the third one â€“ where it "starts to feel expensive, but then you sit down and you think about the time that you spend in email, the ROI, and you still buy it anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>.

For Superhuman, the median answer for the "starting to get expensive" question was $30 per month, which became their chosen price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.

## Market Size and Valuation Check

After picking a price, a quick gut check on market size and valuation targets is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>. For a venture-scale company aiming for a billion-dollar valuation, assuming a 10x ARR multiple, the company would need to achieve $100 million in ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. At $30 per month, this would require 300,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>. By conservatively assuming no other ways to increase Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), such as price increases or new product offerings, Superhuman confidently determined they could reach hundreds of thousands of subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.

This approach demonstrates how [[the_importance_of_pricing_strategy_for_startups_and_tech_companies | startups and tech companies]] can leverage positioning and structured research to inform [[understanding_willingness_to_pay_in_pricing_strategy | pricing strategies]], moving beyond simple cost-plus models or competing solely on being a "bargain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>. This also highlights how [[differentiation_and_cost_leadership_strategies | differentiation]] in product quality and user experience can justify a higher price point. While the transcript does not go into [[different_pricing_models_and_when_to_use_them | different pricing models]], it clearly showcases a value-based pricing strategy.

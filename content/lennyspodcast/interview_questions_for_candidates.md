This article compiles favorite [[effective_interviewing_and_candidate_selection | interview questions]] asked by over 100 guests on Lenny's podcast. These questions are designed to help interviewers identify key traits in candidates and can also be used by candidates to prepare for their own interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Top Interview Questions

### From Aika deMan (Former Head of Product at Roll, PM at Stripe)

### From Shishir Mehrotra (CEO and Co-founder of Coda)

*   **Follow-up**: After the candidate asks initial questions, the interviewer states, "These scientists... will answer only two of your questions, and after that, they expect a plan. What two questions do you ask?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
*   **Purpose**: This hypothetical scenario tests a candidate's ability to identify and ask the most impactful, high-leverage questions that drive key decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. It's designed to see if they can simplify complex problems and focus on essential information. For example, a candidate might ask: "Is it safe enough for humans?" and "Is it more expensive to buy or to run (capex or opex)?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The low-stakes nature of the made-up question helps reveal a candidate's natural problem-solving method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### From Katie Dill (Head of Design at Stripe), Khiem Tran (CEO of Linear), and Camille Hearst (Product Leader at Spotify, former at Patreon)

It also reveals their values and provides a positive way for candidates to share successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

*   **What to Look For**: Good answers show candidates who can provide structure and a path forward through ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Look for individuals who seek help and input, rather than claiming to have all the answers, and who can identify milestones to assess progress and pivot if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### From Noah Weiss (Chief Product Officer at Slack)

*   **Purpose (for the candidate)**: A great way for candidates to assess the alignment of their personal values with the interviewer's and the company's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### From Melum Quan-Burtz (Head of Growth at Deel)

### From Nikhyl Singal (VP of Product at Facebook)
*   **Question**: "What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> (Can be adapted to topics like management or AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>).
*   **Purpose**: Designed to break the "interview mindset" where candidates try to predict what the interviewer wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This question forces candidates to be genuinely opinionated and authentic, preventing the dismissal of high-quality individuals who might otherwise appear disingenuous in a prepared response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

*   **Purpose**: Aims to tease out introspection and reflection. It assesses whether a candidate is reflective about their past decisions, understands why they succeeded or failed, and incorporates those learnings into future decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

### From Scott Belsky (Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, Former Chief Product Officer at Adobe, Founder of Behance)

*   **Purpose**: Tests introspection and openness. It reveals if a candidate can be open and reflective when they hit limits or struggle, rather than blaming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
*   **Question 2**: "Do you consider yourself lucky?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>
*   **Purpose**: Explores humility and self-perception. Those comfortable admitting luck are often more secure, acknowledging that everyone is fortunate and privileged to some extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

### From Lauren Isord (Head of Growth at Notion, Former Head of Growth at Airtable)

*   **Purpose**: This is a powerful [[evaluating_candidate_responses | question]] for reference calls.

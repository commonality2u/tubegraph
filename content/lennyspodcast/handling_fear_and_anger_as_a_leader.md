Matt Mochary, an executive coach for top founders and CEOs, emphasizes that [[challenges_and_strategies_for_senior_leaders | fear and anger]] are common areas where even the most successful leaders struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. He views the ability to navigate these emotions as a critical skill for effective leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## The Impact of Fear

Fear is identified as a primary obstacle that "grips" a leader's mind, preventing them from taking difficult but necessary actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Mochary states that fear gives "bad advice" and leads to "exaggerated predictions" about potential negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

### Overcoming Fear: Doing the Opposite

Mochary's core strategy for combating fear involves making a "bet" with his clients:
*   He predicts that the exact opposite of what the fear-gripped leader expects will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   They start with a lower-stakes situation to test the prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   In hundreds of such bets, Mochary has never lost, because "when someone's in fear, they're gripped, they can't see reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

A common example involves CEOs fearing telling their board about business problems, anticipating a loss of trust that could jeopardize future funding rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Mochary advises them to be transparent, predicting that it will build trust instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. In every instance, boards have appreciated the honesty and transparency, leading to increased trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

The general advice is: If you feel fear (not physical danger), do the opposite of what your brain tells you, but always check with someone who is not experiencing fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

## The Impact of Anger

Anger is described as a destructive force that breaks relationships, especially with those closest to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Mochary learned that anger is not a primary emotion but "actually a cover" for pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. When feeling pain, the brain externalizes it as anger, pushing it onto others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Overcoming Anger: Feeling the Pain

The solution to anger is to allow oneself to "feel the pain" that it is covering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. While this can be difficult and even "hurts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, it prevents projecting anger onto others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

Mochary's wife helped him develop a non-defensive way to receive feedback about anger: "I perceive you to be in anger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This "I statement" removes judgment and allows for self-awareness, enabling a shift out of the emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Communicating During Difficult Conversations

When delivering difficult news, especially in situations like layoffs, Mochary advises leaders to:
1.  **Prepare the individual**: Start by saying, "This is going to be a difficult conversation. I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself. You are not going to enjoy this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. This reduces the shock, which often triggers the amygdala (fear response) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
2.  **Deliver the message**: Clearly state the news, e.g., "I'm letting you go. Here's why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.
3.  **Allow emotional release**: Ask, "My guess is you're feeling a lot of anger right now, fear, sadness. Is that true? And if so, would you be willing to share with me what you're feeling and what you're thinking?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. This provides a safe space for them to express their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.
4.  **[[effective_listening_and_communication_as_a_leader | Make them feel heard]]**: Actively listen and reflect their feelings back to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. This shows empathy and presence, preventing them from feeling abandoned with their pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

## How to [[effective_listening_and_communication_as_a_leader | Make People Feel Heard]]

Mochary outlines three levels of [[effective_listening_and_communication_as_a_leader | making people feel heard]]:
1.  **Acknowledge written contributions**: In group settings, after people write down solutions, read them and say, "Thank you [Name]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.
2.  **Verbal repetition**: Ask them to state their opinion verbally, then repeat it back: "I think what I heard you say is X, is that right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. Continue until they confirm your understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.
3.  **Reflect unstated thoughts/emotions**: Especially when receiving feedback, people often "couch" or "polish" their thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. To make them truly feel heard, reflect back what you *imagine* their deeper, unstated thoughts are, including strong emotions: "I think what I'm hearing you say is you're pissed off and you're thinking, 'Screw you Matt, how dare you walk into the office and not even say hello to me.' Is that close?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. This often reveals their "thoughts are bigger than their words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

After making someone feel heard, a leader must then decide whether to accept the feedback and take action, or explain why it cannot be accepted, sharing their own context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.

Mochary states that all his methods, including scripts for difficult conversations and [[effective_listening_and_communication_as_a_leader | making people feel heard]], are publicly available in his curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. He believes that once someone tries these methods and sees they work, that success provides all the motivation needed to continue practicing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.

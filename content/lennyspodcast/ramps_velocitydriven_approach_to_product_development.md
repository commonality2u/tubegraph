Ramp, a finance automation platform and corporate card solution for small to medium-sized businesses, is recognized as the fastest-growing SaaS business in history, achieving over $100 million in annual run rate within two years with a lean team of under 50 people in their R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Jeff Charles, VP of Product at Ramp, highlights that the company's success is deeply rooted in its "velocity-driven" approach to product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Importance of Velocity

Velocity is paramount at Ramp, influencing everything from product development processes and team incentives to hiring, promotion, decision-making, and organizational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. This focus originated during the pandemic when a small team faced a large market opportunity, making execution speed crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

High velocity is seen as a strong indicator of team performance, enabling continuous iteration to achieve impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. It also attracts top talent who want to build and ship products rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, and it helps de-risk decisions by making the cost of incorrect choices low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Examples of Velocity in Action

Ramp's rapid development is demonstrated by:
*   Building a competitor to MX in three months with about eight engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
*   Developing a competitor to Expensify six months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   Expanding into accounts payable with a team of three engineers, one designer, and one PM, delivering a product handling billions of dollars annually within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Operationalizing Velocity

Ramp's [[strategies_for_fast_product_development_in_startups | strategies for fast product development in startups]] are based on several key principles:

### Small, Single-Threaded Teams
Ramp emphasizes forming small, focused teams with a single goal or "thread" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This ensures individual contributors can wake up each day with one clear objective, removing distractions and other responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. An example is the "Flex product" team, which focused solely on e-commerce companies' cash flow needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Shielding Teams from Distractions
Core teams are protected from external chaos, including bugs, issues, and cross-functional requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This is achieved through:
*   **Rotational production engineering**: Engineers protect core development teams from escalations and bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Product operators**: These individuals shield Product Managers from documentation, escalations, release management, enablement, and customer requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Dedicated sub-teams for big bets**: For new products, teams are reorganized without existing product responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. New initiatives are often kept under wraps until they achieve product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Lofty Goals and Market Comparables
Ramp sets ambitious goals, often benchmarked against publicly traded competitors like MX, Expensify, Bill.com, and Concur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This provides motivation and de-risks business decisions by validating existing markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Designs are also used as a motivational tool, with designers creating visionary prototypes of future products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Ramp is very revenue-driven, anchoring teams to market opportunities and revenue goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### Context Over Control (Empowering Teams)
Instead of micromanaging, Ramp's leadership provides context to empower teams. Alignment focuses on:
1.  **Goals**: What the team aims to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
2.  **Hypothesis**: Why they believe their approach will work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
3.  **Data**: The evidence supporting the hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
4.  **Potential Solution**: The proposed way to test the hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

Leaders should debate upstream elements (data interpretation, hypotheses, goals) rather than being prescriptive about solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. The role of management is to continuously provide context to help teams make better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. This "repeater in chief" approach ensures teams understand the long-term vision and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

### Minimizing Meetings and Status Updates
Ramp avoids unnecessary meetings and status updates, viewing them as a "huge waste of time" that demotivate people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. Statuses are handled asynchronously in real-time within existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. Meetings are reserved for collaboration, ideation, and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

### Clear Trade-offs
When asked to achieve many goals, product managers are advised to present clear trade-offs to leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. By offering a "menu of items" and explaining what will *not* be done, teams can execute faster on fewer, more focused initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

### Emphasis on Talent
Underpinning Ramp's velocity is the high caliber of its engineering and design talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. There's a strong investment in R&D as a first-class citizen, paying top market rates, and focusing on the tech brand to attract empowered individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

## [[balancing_speed_and_quality_in_product_development | Balancing Speed and Quality in Product Development]]

Ramp finds that quality increases with product velocity because faster iteration allows for quick fixes and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. To maintain quality amidst high velocity, Ramp implements control mechanisms:
*   **Voice of Customer (VoC)**: Every negative review is shared monthly with the tech lead, PM, and designer responsible for that product area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This is part of [[integrating_customer_feedback_into_product_development | integrating customer feedback into product development]].
*   **NPS and CSAT Reporting**: Key metrics are regularly reported back to teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   **Operational Overhead**: Teams are held accountable for the percentage of support tickets originating from their product area, normalized by user count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
*   **Direct Bug Assignment**: Bugs and issues are assigned directly to the on-call engineer, fostering immediate ownership and resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. There is no bug backlog; bugs are fixed as soon as they are surfaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **Confusion Metrics**: The number of support tickets due to customer confusion is tracked. If this number is elevated, teams are required to fix these issues before shipping new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

## Avoiding Burnout

Ramp believes that velocity can actually help prevent burnout, which often arises from a lack of impact despite significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. The goal is not endless hours, but rather enabling individuals to operate in a "flow state" by removing distractions and focusing on building great products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

Managers contribute to this by making team goals feel like individual ownership. When employees feel they are building their "mini-company," burnout is radically reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

## Planning and Strategy

Ramp minimizes extensive planning. A key quote is: "Any second you spend planning is a second you don't spend doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. New hires are explicitly told that Ramp prioritizes velocity, which entails some chaos, constant change, and products that might not work perfectly initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.

Planning is limited to high-value areas like major market moments that require coordination across product, marketing, and sales, typically once a quarter or every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. The majority of R&D focus remains autonomously chaotic within individual pods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

### Strategy Document Components
Each product pod creates a strategy document, acting as a "contract" with leadership, outlining:
*   Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>
*   Hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>
*   Unique positioning to achieve the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>
*   Metrics for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>
*   Initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>
*   Risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>
*   Long-term outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>

An example of unique positioning is Ramp's expansion into bill payments from corporate cards, leveraging existing infrastructure for money movement, liability processing, accounting integrations, and risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. This focus on "right to win" increases velocity by building on existing components and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

### OKRs
Ramp generally avoids OKRs from a product perspective, preferring to focus on the product roadmap as the primary "contract" with sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>. OKRs are primarily used for cross-functional initiatives or financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.

## [[leveraging_first_principles_thinking_in_product_management | Leveraging First Principles Thinking in Product Management]]

Ramp's unique business model (credit card, payments, and software company for both SMBs and Enterprise) necessitates [[leveraging_first_principles_thinking_in_product_management | first principles thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>. This means not pattern-matching from past experiences but going back to fundamental principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.

An example is Ramp's support team structure, where support reports directly to the product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. The first principle is that "every support ticket is a failure of our product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This directly holds the product team accountable for user experience. Support agents are incentivized to decrease ticket volume rather than just resolving tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. This unconventional approach has resulted in an extremely low contact rate despite a large user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.

## Doing "So Much with So Few PMs"

With a lean team of 13 PMs for over 100 engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>, Ramp achieves high output by:

*   **Making everyone think like PMs**: Empowering engineers and designers to consider specs, priorities, and scope, fostering a [[building_a_productoriented_engineering_culture | product-oriented engineering culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.
*   **Investing in product operations**: A dedicated team handles operational functions like project management, issue management, release management, enablement, and customer research, freeing up PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.
*   **Cutting low-leverage PM work**: PMs at Ramp don't write tickets or spend time in ticket management systems. Their contract is the vision, priority, and a high-level spec, with engineers owning the breakdown of work and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

The core PM job at Ramp involves:
*   **Team building**: Creating a strong team culture within the pod, especially since direct reports may be matrixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.
*   **Focus areas**: Ensuring the team is humming and focused on the right areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.
*   **Protection**: Shielding the core team from stakeholders and acting as a central point of contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

## Identifying A-Plus Engineers/Designers

Ramp looks for individuals who:
*   Want to win in the market and against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.
*   Understand the business context and are curious about how the company makes money and customer preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.
*   Can execute without constant help and are proactive in their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.
*   Set the pace for PMs and designers, asking them to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.
*   Demonstrate accountability for their product's performance and proactively address feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.

Ramp values engineers and designers who have strong opinions and challenge decisions, even if it makes management harder, as it leads to deeper thinking and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.

## Hiring Philosophy

When hiring, Ramp prioritizes candidates with a strong desire to have an impact and the ability to think deeply over extensive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. They look for signals like candidates leaving previous roles due to slow pace or bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>. Interview questions often probe difficult decisions and trade-offs to assess depth of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.

## Advice for Product Managers

For product managers facing pressure to move faster, Jeff Charles advises:
*   **[[strategies_for_fast_product_development_in_startups | Leverage asks]]**: Use the demand for velocity as an opportunity to advocate for empowerment, trust, process elimination, and increased focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:03">[02:08:03]</a>.
*   **Kill meetings**: Minimize unnecessary meetings and status updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>.
*   **Define clear trade-offs**: Clearly communicate what will and will not be done to leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:27">[02:09:27]</a>.

## Productivity Tips

To foster deep thinking and organizational efficiency:
*   **Writing for Clarity**: When faced with complex problems, write down the question simply and spend time thinking about the answer before researching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.
*   **Deep Work Blocks**: Schedule dedicated time for deep work, especially during less busy periods like early mornings, late afternoons, or weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>. Leaders should avoid being in the critical path to allow for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>.
*   **Streamlined Task Management**: End each meeting by writing down tasks owed by oneself and others, with clear deadlines. Use a simple system (e.g., notes) to group tasks (tactical vs. strategic, important vs. less important) and send reminders. The goal is to free up "headspace for processing, not memory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.
*   **Manage Notifications**: Turn off notifications, quit Slack during deep work, and check emails only once a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>.
*   **Master Your Tools**: Train yourself and your team to effectively use tools like calendars, Slack, and email to maximize efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

## [[managing_change_and_maintaining_momentum_in_product_development | Managing Change and Maintaining Momentum in Product Development]]

Ramp accepts that successful startups involve a degree of chaos, as it is a byproduct of hypergrowth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. However, this is balanced by a consistent long-term vision and strategy. Ramp has always been the "spend management platform that helps you spend less," and this core strategy remains stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. While specifics and timing may change, the fundamental goals, value proposition, and problem statement are consistent, preventing "thrash" and ensuring product efforts contribute to long-term objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

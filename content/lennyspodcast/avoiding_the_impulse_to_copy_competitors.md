In the rapidly evolving field of growth, there's a strong interest in "growth hacks"â€”surefire methods to achieve rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, especially in the age of social media where everyone shares tips and tricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, these often come out of context or are specific to one example, meaning they don't apply as a general pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Why Blind Copying Fails
Obsessing over competition is a common pitfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. While understanding what competitors are doing is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>, directly copying their tactics or flows because they seem successful is a common mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> Every single experience is highly unique to its specific customer and channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. You may not even be seeing the actual experience, as it could be a tester cell or personalized based on sign-up data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

Blatantly implementing competitors' designs or features into your own product often leads to very subpar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. This approach often stems from a desire to skip crucial steps like ideation, user research, customer interviews, or A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>, under the flawed assumption that "it works for them, it must work for us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This strategy fails 95% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

> Copying competition is the fastest way to mediocrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. You can never be a leader if you're just copying someone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. A leader is, by definition, someone who separates themselves from the pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

Benchmarks derived from competitors can also be misleading and dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Definitions for metrics like sign-ups or conversion rates vary wildly from company to company, making direct comparisons unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. Blindly adopting benchmarks without understanding the underlying definitions is a sure way to fail initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.

## Leveraging Competition Effectively
While there are no true shortcuts in growth, there are patterns and frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. Competition should be used for inspiration, not replication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. For example, when building a sharing model, one can look at how companies like Slack, Figma, Miro, or Notion handle it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. Identify common elements, apply those that fit your product, and then [[Contrarian approaches in business strategy|derive your own solution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Use competitors' approaches as an input into ideation, but never as the final destination for your results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

It's helpful to avoid starting from scratch, and competition provides a valuable starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. However, this never replaces your own ideation, design, user research, customer interviews, and experimentation steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. Always balance external inspiration with your own product innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

A common misconception is that if a "fancy company" or a successful product has a particular design or flow, it must be perfectly optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. In reality, large companies often operate with significant internal chaos and guessing, and many elements may not be thoughtfully implemented or perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.

## The "Your Problem Isn't Unique" Principle
A crucial understanding is that your growth problems are rarely unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. Someone else, somewhere, has likely faced and solved a similar challenge, or at least experienced many failures that can be learned from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. Re-engineering solutions from the ground up is a waste of time and incurs a huge opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

Instead, actively seek out people who have solved similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. Leveraging professional networks like LinkedIn or X to connect with experts and ask about their experiences can provide invaluable shortcuts to optimal solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.

The market evolves rapidly, making it inefficient to solve every problem uniquely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. The focus should be on [[Contrarian approaches in business strategy|patternization]]: figuring out frameworks to solve categories of problems, not just individual ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. This allows teams to reach 60% of a solution much faster, leaving room for authentic implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. In today's industry, there's no time to manually go from zero to 60 as a one-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> When tasked with building a community at Miro, despite being an interim CMO, the speaker admitted not knowing where to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. By consulting an expert, they learned about different types of communities (user, agency, partner) and gained structural guidance that led to much better results than if they had tried to figure it out alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>.

This approach requires humility and setting aside ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>. While failure is an unavoidable part of growth, learning from others significantly shortens the failure cycles, saving crucial time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.

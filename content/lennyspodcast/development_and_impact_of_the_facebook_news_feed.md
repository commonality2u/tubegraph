The Facebook News Feed, a product that ultimately defined the platform, was one of [[early_days_of_facebook_and_engineering_challenges | Andrew Bosworth's]] (Bos) earliest projects at Facebook, which he joined in early 2006 as one of the first engineers [00:56:07]. The News Feed, the first-ever algorithmically ranked content feed of any social network, is what most people today associate with Facebook [01:10:59]. It and the ads platform that Bos also helped build, are estimated to have generated a trillion dollars of value [00:41:00].

## Initial Reception and Challenges
When the News Feed was initially launched, it was met with significant controversy and user outrage [00:30:00]. Users did not want to share that much information, and there was considerable resistance to the change [01:31:15].

Despite the backlash, user engagement immediately doubled [00:37:00]. This presented a clear case of "cognitive dissonance" where stated preferences (outrage) conflicted with revealed preferences (increased usage) [01:12:00]. This immediate increase in usage made it "an easier case" for Facebook to stick with the product, despite the public outcry [01:34:54].

Andrew Bosworth, reflecting on the experience, emphasizes the importance of conviction in product development [01:31:15]. While acknowledging that Facebook "screwed some things up" in the initial execution, such as broadcasting wall posts more widely than users intended [01:35:00], the core "thing itself was right" [01:37:00].

## Technical Innovation
The News Feed was notable for being the first consumer product to use artificial intelligence (AI) for content ranking at scale [01:33:00]. Andrew Bosworth was involved in building this early AI code to rank the News Feed [01:33:34].

Mark Zuckerberg was heavily involved in the early development, "whiteboarding every single pixel" on the front and back ends, and pushing for algorithmic ranking [01:27:56]. Bosworth himself focused on the ranking systems [01:28:09]. Later, when modernizing the ranking systems, Zuckerberg remained deeply involved in decisions like mix shift and weighing different factors [01:28:21].

## Lessons Learned
The experience of building the News Feed taught Bosworth several key lessons:
*   **Conviction Over Initial User Feedback**: Sometimes, product developers need to have conviction in their vision even if initial user feedback is negative, especially if behavioral data shows positive engagement [01:31:15].
*   **Understanding User Intent**: It's crucial to distinguish between user resistance to change and fundamental flaws in the product idea. In the News Feed's case, users didn't object to the underlying concept but to the way their information was suddenly broadcast [01:35:00].
*   **Passion Fuels Productivity**: Andrew Bosworth described his work on the News Feed as consuming him "more fully than anything in life had ever consumed me" [01:31:15]. This experience highlighted how passion for a project leads to smarter, more productive, and "order of magnitude more productive" work [01:37:31]. He later discovered he could develop passion for various areas, including ads and hardware, by giving himself space to explore them [01:38:39].

The success of the News Feed demonstrates the [[Importance of user feedback in product development | importance of user feedback]], not just in expressed opinions, but in revealed behavior, and the need for strong leadership conviction in guiding product direction.

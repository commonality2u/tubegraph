[[Customercentric product development | Talking to customers]] and gathering feedback is a foundational element for a startup's success, particularly in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:57">[03:30:57]</a>. Dalton Caldwell, a managing director at Y Combinator, emphasizes that founders must stay deeply connected to their product and continuously engage with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:57">[03:30:57]</a>.

## Why Talking to Customers is Crucial

The most common reason a startup fails is that founders "don't talk to customers" and therefore "don't find product market fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:04">[03:07:04]</a>. Dalton Caldwell completely agrees with this assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:04">[03:07:04]</a>. Startups that successfully "turn it around" often share a common trait: their founders genuinely love their customers and their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:58">[09:42:58]</a>. For instance, the founders of Airbnb "really liked the first host that they met and they knew all their names," loving their startup even when it was struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:58">[09:52:58]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Founders can sometimes be pushed by investors to hire executives or scale the team too early, leading to "over-delegation" and founders taking their "eye off the ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:45:18">[33:45:18]</a>. It's crucial not to "over-delegate" and for founders to remain close to the product and customer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:01">[32:43:01]</a>.

A "contrarian" belief held by Dalton Caldwell is that "growth and growth hacking and doing all this analytics AB testing stuff is a total waste of time for very early startups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. This type of [[Integrating user research effectively into product development | advice]], often geared towards later-stage companies, can confuse seed-stage founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. Focusing on complex growth hacking theories when there are "no customers" is actively unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.

Instead of focusing on large-scale analytics, founders should concentrate on understanding their first customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. Founders' intuition about how to prioritize their time will be correct if they genuinely love what they are doing and are "obsessed with product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:11">[03:59:11]</a>.

## Effective Communication with Customers

The biggest barrier to [[Effective communication with customers | effective communication with customers]] is often "social anxiety and looking stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. Founders need to overcome this shyness and proactively "get out in the world and talk to people in person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. Relying solely on landing pages, ads, or online engagement is not the same as direct customer interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

### Practical Advice

*   **In-person meetings**: Founders should aim for a significant portion of their time, perhaps 20-30%, to be dedicated to "in-person physical meetings with potential customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **Early engagement**: It is a mistake to delay talking to customers until after raising a pre-seed round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>.
*   **Persistence**: Power through the awkwardness of initial conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. Once accustomed to it, talking to customers can actually be enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.
*   **Deep understanding**: Instead of just buying ads, founders should have a sophisticated view of how to grow their company, focusing on the specific needs of their market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.
*   **Learn from early successes**: Study how successful companies like Facebook gained their "first thousand users" rather than their current large-scale strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

### Examples of Effective Customer Engagement

*   **Brex**: The founders talked directly to other companies within their YC batch to understand their needs, which was extremely effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>.
*   **Retool**: They successfully sold their product within the YC network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>.
*   **Zip**: The founders were "beasts at getting companies on calls with them to ask them about procurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>. They would "cold DM people on LinkedIn" asking for advice about current procurement products, which led to early beta testers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>. They conducted "hundreds of these" calls, treating it as a numbers game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>.
*   **Stripe (The Collison Install)**: The founders understood that even after a customer agrees to buy ("yes"), the sale isn't complete until the product is implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. They developed a tactic of physically visiting customers, offering to "drop by to your office to help you implement Stripe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. They would stay and guide the customer through the installation process, providing "white glove service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. Patrick Collison, Stripe's co-founder, was "very hands-on with all of his customers" and "extremely available" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:25">[01:27:25]</a>.
*   **PostHog**: After launching an open-source product, their calendars were filled with conversations from people trying to implement it, providing invaluable feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:52">[01:44:52]</a>.

## Building Conviction

Conviction in a startup builds over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>. Founders often don't have full certainty that their idea will work in the early stages, especially without customers or a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>. However, as the product starts to gain traction and customers provide positive feedback, conviction grows in a "network effect virtual cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.

## Final Advice

To begin a startup journey, Dalton Caldwell's tactical advice is to "start doing customer validation first versus building a PowerPoint deck versus trying to raise money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. If potential customers are genuinely excited and willing to use or even pre-purchase the product, this serves as a "great green light" to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. The building of the product should commence once there is enough conviction, even if it's just "one person" who would use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.

At Linear, product management is considered a go-to-market discipline, operating in a "double triangle" of collaboration that extends beyond the traditional product, engineering, and design triad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>. This approach aims to bridge the gap between product development and the commercial goals of the company, ensuring what is built aligns with what is sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.

## Product Management as a Go-to-Market Discipline

Many organizations often experience antagonism between product teams and sales/marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>. However, when these functions come together, it creates a powerful synergy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>. Product managers, due to their deep understanding of customer needs and requirements gathering, are uniquely positioned to know the "native language" of their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.

This deep customer understanding allows product managers to:
*   Help marketing teams select the precise wording and phrasing that resonates with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.
*   Ensure that product messaging sounds authentic and speaks to expert practitioners, who often have a "sensitive BS detector" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
*   Originate the core message for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.

At Linear, the product team includes a full-time product marketer whose role is to craft language for releases, manage change logs, and build assets for campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Sales teams then validate this messaging in the field, providing a valuable feedback cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

## The "Double Triangle" Collaboration Model

The concept of a "double triangle" suggests that a product manager sits at the center, connecting two key triads:
1.  **Building Side:** Product, engineering, and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.
2.  **Selling Side:** Product management, sales, and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

This model emphasizes that product managers are responsible for taking the company's commercial motivations and goals and ensuring that what is built effectively addresses them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. For product managers, particularly in B2B environments, leaning into the sales and marketing (go-to-market) side presents a significant opportunity for impact that might otherwise be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>.

## B2B Software as a Teacher of Process

A key aspect of [[effective_product_management_strategies | B2B software]] is that it doesn't just solve problems; it often teaches users *how to work* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. When a company adopts a B2B tool, they are also adopting the underlying practices and processes embedded within that tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>. This means a software tool can introduce a baseline level of competency, with its defaults becoming the "worst we can do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.

This perspective informs Linear's approach:
*   **Opinionated Design:** Linear is opinionated about how product teams should operate, based on observed successful practices among high-performing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Customization:** The company avoids extensive customization features, especially those requested by middle managers for reporting, as these often complicate workflows for individual contributors (ICs) and can lead to "bloatedness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing ICs:** Linear explicitly prioritizes the experience of ICs over middle managers, as disengagement from ICs due to complex tools leads to bad data and ineffective reporting anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. This deliberate choice shapes the product's appeal and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## The Importance of External Deadlines

For go-to-market success, external deadlines for marketing launches are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. Missing these opportunities is not just an inconvenience; it means losing a chance to communicate with your audience that cannot be recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>. Product teams should:
*   Treat external deadlines with the utmost seriousness, almost as "P-zero problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.
*   Cut as much scope as necessary to hit the deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>.
*   Focus on delivering a working product, even if it doesn't have all desired features, to ensure a "go" decision can be made at the launch moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.
*   Prioritize early shipping and rapid iteration to set themselves up to meet commitments, rather than spending extensive time on estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

This strict adherence to external deadlines ensures that marketing campaigns can proceed as planned, leveraging limited communication opportunities with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.

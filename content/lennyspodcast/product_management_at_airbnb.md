Airbnb's approach to [[Role of Product Managers | product management]] has undergone significant changes, particularly following a period of internal challenges and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. CEO Brian Chesky has emphasized a shift towards a more integrated, detail-oriented, and product-led strategy, moving away from traditional models that he believes fostered bureaucracy and inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Product Management Function

Brian Chesky's comments at Figma Config about changes to [[Product management in Tech Companies | product management]] at Airbnb caused a stir, leading many to believe the function had been eliminated [0:30:00]. This perception was met with cheers from designers present [0:06:12]. However, Chesky clarified that it was not an elimination of people but a change in how they work together [0:06:44].

The key adjustments made to the [[Role of Product Managers | product management]] function include:
*   **Combination of Responsibilities** The inbound responsibilities traditionally held by [[Role of Product Managers | product managers]] have been combined with the outbound responsibilities of product marketing [0:06:59]. This ensures that product builders are also experts in how the product is talked about and its market, recognizing that a great product is ineffective if no one knows about it [0:07:42].
*   **Offloading Program Management** Many program management tasks previously performed by [[Role of Product Managers | product managers]] were offloaded to dedicated program managers [0:07:13]. This clarifies roles and focuses the product team on core product development.
*   **Smaller, More Senior Teams** The product group was made significantly smaller and more senior, focusing on expertise rather than broad headcount [0:07:30].
*   **Influence-Based Management** The product function does not control or drive design or engineering. Instead, they manage by influence within a purely functional model [0:08:21].

## Addressing Previous Challenges

Before these changes, Airbnb experienced challenges common in growing companies, which Chesky aimed to resolve:
*   **Frustration Among Designers** Designers often felt frustrated with the product development process, viewing themselves as "design administrators" rather than integral to product creation [0:09:02]. Silicon Valley's tendency to treat design as a service organization contributed to this [0:09:20].
*   **Technical Debt and Dependencies** Different technical stacks led to accumulating technical debt and numerous dependencies between teams [0:09:44]. This created bottlenecks and prompted teams to build redundant services, like their own marketing departments [0:10:15].
*   **Divisional Structure and Politics** The company operated with multiple divisions (e.g., flights, homes, experiences), each pursuing separate directions [0:22:40]. This fostered advocacy for individual divisions, leading to internal politics and bureaucracy, with meetings often focused on meetings rather than productive work [0:10:40].
*   **Lack of Cohesion and Accountability** The fragmented structure resulted in a lack of cohesive understanding, making it difficult to get work done and leading to a sense of "what I do doesn't matter" among employees [0:11:09].
*   **Ineffective Marketing Spend** A reliance on performance marketing (seen as a "laser" for specific corners) over brand marketing (a "chandelier" for lighting up the whole room) meant marketing efforts didn't create accumulating advantages and failed to educate users about new features [0:12:21]. This led to more incremental product development [0:13:35].
*   **Slow Product Evolution** Despite thousands of engineers and numerous product shipments, customers couldn't identify significant changes to the app over several years [0:20:13].

## New Approach to Product Development

A near-death business experience during the pandemic provided clarity and spurred Chesky to fundamentally change how Airbnb operates [0:24:20].

Key aspects of the new approach include:
*   **CEO as Chief Product Officer** Chesky believes the CEO of a product or tech company should essentially serve as the chief product officer, remaining deeply involved in the product rather than delegating it entirely [0:16:37].
*   **Functional Operating Model** Airbnb transitioned from a divisional model back to a functional model, similar to a startup. This means functions like design, engineering, product marketing, marketing, communications, sales, and operations are centralized rather than embedded within separate business units [0:25:52].
*   **Streamlined Projects and Layers** The number of concurrent projects was drastically cut, focusing on doing a few things exceptionally well (e.g., three teams doing one thing rather than one team doing three) [0:25:30]. Layers of management were removed to minimize distance between leaders and teams [0:25:46].
*   **Fewer, More Senior Employees** The company consciously maintains a smaller, more senior workforce, believing that adding more people can slow projects down [0:26:09].
*   **Expert Executives** Executives are expected to be experts in their functional domains, managing both the work and the people, rather than just being "people managers" [0:26:30].
*   **Centralized Decision-Making and Shared Consciousness** Decision-making was pulled up to the top leadership (30-40 people) to foster a single shared consciousness across the company [0:27:12].
*   **Rolling Two-Year Product Roadmap** The company now operates with a rolling two-year product roadmap, updated every month, with product releases occurring twice a year (May and November/October) [0:13:52]. All new features must be on this roadmap, except for some infrastructure projects [0:28:21].
*   **CEO Product and Marketing Reviews** Chesky personally reviews all product and marketing work on a regular cadence (weekly, bi-weekly, etc.) [0:28:31]. This allows for direct identification of bottlenecks and ensures cross-functional collaboration, eliminating the need for influence-based persuasion [0:29:05].
*   **In-House Creative Agency** Airbnb built its own in-house creative agency responsible for not just ads but also creative aspects of the product [0:30:21].
*   **Integrated Writing Functions** UX writing was merged with marketing writing to ensure a single, consistent voice across all customer touchpoints (emails, app, ads) [0:30:41].
*   **Product Marketing Focus** The product marketing team is responsible for figuring out how users will learn about new products, including demos, storytelling, and video assets [0:14:32]. This ensures that new features are properly communicated and adopted [0:13:31].
*   **Functional Teams (No Guest/Host Teams)** There are no longer separate guest and host teams. Instead, there are unified design, marketing, and engineering teams, recognizing that most features connect both guests and hosts [0:41:49].
*   **Emphasis on Product Quality for Growth** Instead of relying heavily on paid growth channels, Airbnb now bets that building the best possible product and effectively telling people about it will drive growth [0:40:16]. They still use performance marketing for balancing supply and demand but prioritize brand marketing and product-led growth [0:34:57].
*   **First-Principle Thinking** The "add a zero" exercise encourages teams to think 10x bigger, pushing them to break down problems into foundational elements and reconstruct them differently to find innovative solutions [0:46:33].
*   **Bias for Action and Decisiveness** Leaders are encouraged to set a fast pace, make quick decisions, and maintain a bias for action to avoid delays and bureaucracy [0:47:51].
*   **Empowering Through Belief** Leaders should see potential in people they may not see in themselves, creating a "growth mindset" organization where challenging feedback is seen as belief in greater potential [0:49:13].

## Recent Product Launches Reflecting the New Strategy

Airbnb's Winter Release exemplifies the new approach, with products designed to combine uniqueness with reliability [0:39:57].
*   **Guest Favorites** This feature leverages 370 million reviews, customer service data, and host cancellation data to identify the top two million homes guests love the most, offering reliability akin to hotels while retaining Airbnb's unique inventory [0:40:16].
*   **Ratings and Reviews Overhaul** The core trust system of ratings and reviews received an upgrade [0:41:04].
*   **Overhauled Host Tab** Recognizing the importance of host tools for a great guest experience, the host tab was completely redesigned. This "listing tab" simplifies management and provides hosts with better tools, including an [[AI product management strategies | AI-powered photo tour]] that organizes photos by room using a custom-trained computer vision language [0:41:11].
*   **New Design Aesthetic** Airbnb is also pioneering a new design aesthetic, moving beyond flat design towards interfaces with more color, texture, and dimensionality, which Chesky believes is the future of interface design, especially with the rise of AI [0:42:51].

## Maintaining Balance and Learning

Chesky acknowledges that the initial phase of implementing these changes was demanding, but they ultimately led to greater efficiency and less reactive work [0:51:10]. He shares personal strategies for avoiding burnout and fostering continuous growth:
*   **Structured Breaks** Taking intense work periods followed by complete breaks (e.g., working intensely every other weekend and taking the alternate weekend off) [0:53:20].
*   **Health and Well-being** Prioritizing exercise (daily cardio, gym workouts), healthy eating (bodybuilding diet), and sufficient sleep [0:53:35].
*   **Strong Relationships** Recognizing that healthy relationships are crucial for happiness, Chesky actively maintains connections with friends and family, making time for shared experiences [0:54:02].
*   **Proactive Prioritization** Avoiding "fake work" (tasks that feel productive but don't move the needle) by proactively setting agendas rather than reacting to incoming emails and meeting requests [0:57:36].
*   **Beginner's Mindset** Approaching challenges with curiosity and a "beginner's mindset" allows for continuous learning and fresh perspectives, even when at the "frontier of knowledge" [0:59:19].
*   **Shamelessness in Seeking Help** Not being afraid to ask for help from others, recognizing that it's often an honor for people to be asked [1:00:54].
*   **Learning by Teaching** Actively engaging in sharing knowledge and advice, as it also serves as a way to learn [1:04:57].

Chesky's background as an artist and industrial designer, who studied various design fields and even attended a military high school, provides a unique perspective that he believes informs Airbnb's distinctive approach to product and company building [1:05:19]. He advocates for more organizations to embrace curiosity, imagination, and a well-rounded way of thinking, integrating both "art and science" in their approach to [[Product management strategies and frameworks | product management strategies]] [1:12:04].

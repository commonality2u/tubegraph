Many companies tend to under-resource Search Engine Optimization (SEO) while over-resourcing advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For large companies like Zillow or eBay, spending tens of millions on ads while only allocating tens of thousands to SEO "doesn't make sense" given the potential traffic SEO can generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For startups, understanding when and whether to invest in SEO is crucial.

## Key Attributes for SEO as a Growth Driver

There are two primary factors to consider when evaluating if SEO can be a significant growth driver for a company:

1.  **Large Addressable Market** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>:
    *   Most categories tend to have a large addressable market for SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
    *   To assess this, analyze product competitors and audience competitors using tools like Similarweb.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This tool shows total traffic and traffic by channel, giving a sense of potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
    *   Consider the total estimated traffic of competitors, multiply it by an assumed conversion rate, and compare this potential sales volume to other channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

2.  **Existing Authority and Traction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>:
    *   Google prefers to rank credible domains, not just "SEO sites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   **Non-SEO Traffic**: A site should ideally have at least 1,000 daily visits from non-search channels (e.g., direct, paid, email, social) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This signals to Google that the site is not solely reliant on SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
    *   **Referring Domains**: Aim for at least 1,000 referring domains (links from other websites) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This also indicates credibility and authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
    *   The more existing authority and traction a site has, the easier and faster it can grow with SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### When it's Too Soon

If a company is starting from zero with little to no traction or authority, it's generally "too soon" to heavily invest in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Focus first on building a credible domain and gaining initial traffic through other channels. Once traction is established, SEO can then multiply that traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

### Impact of Product Structure on SEO Investment

The nature of a product can influence the *scope* (effort required) of SEO, but rarely makes it impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

*   **User-Generated Content (UGC) or Extensive Databases**: Products with a lot of UGC (like Glassdoor) or vast product catalogs (like Zillow with addresses, or shopping sites with many SKUs) have lower scope for SEO because much of the content can be programmatically generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
*   **No UGC/SKUs**: Even without these, companies can still compete through [[seo_as_a_product_and_collaboration_with_product_teams | editorial SEO]] and other methods, though the initial scope may be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

## Prioritizing SEO Among Other Channels

Ultimately, the decision to invest in SEO should be made by comparing its potential impact and cost against other growth opportunities (e.g., paid ads, social media, brand building) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. If other channels are performing exceptionally well, it might make sense to double down there first before heavily investing in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

## SEO Timelines and Early Indicators

SEO is generally a long-term investment, with results typically appearing within six to nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>. However, this timeline is highly dependent on a company's existing authority and traction:

*   **High Authority**: For large sites with established authority (like Netflix or eBay), changes can show results in days or weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>.
*   **Newer Companies**: A brand new company starting from scratch might take up to a year to see significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. This includes approximately three months for strategy, content creation, and launch, followed by three to six months for ranking and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

### Leading Indicators of Success

For founders concerned about the long lead time, there are early signals to look for that indicate SEO is on the right track:

*   **Initial Rankings**: Pages starting to rank, even if low (e.g., position 15-20), within the first few weeks after launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
*   **Rank Improvement**: Observing steady improvement in keyword rankings (e.g., moving from position 15 to 12, then to 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.
*   **Impressions**: Seeing impressions for target keywords, even if clicks are minimal at lower positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   **Engagement**: Google monitors user engagement, including click-through rates from search results and time spent on a page. Better engagement signals lead to higher rankings for more competitive keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

These leading indicators, even with a small number of pages (e.g., 10-30 articles), can signal opportunity and justify scaling up investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. It's common for initial attempts to not be perfectly implemented, so a lack of early results doesn't always mean "stop," but rather that the strategy might need adjustment or more authority is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.

## Initial Steps to Explore SEO Opportunity

For a startup founder looking to explore SEO after understanding these considerations:

1.  **Assess Addressable Market Size**: Use tools like Similarweb to analyze traffic for product and audience competitors. Determine if the market is large enough to be meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>.
2.  **Evaluate Current Authority**: Check your site's non-SEO traffic and the number of referring domains (using tools like Ahrefs or Semrush) to gauge your current traction and authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.
3.  **Compare with Other Channels**: Objectively weigh the potential return on investment (ROI) and scope of SEO against all other alternative growth initiatives and budget allocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>.

By systematically evaluating these factors, startups can make informed decisions about when to commit resources to SEO and integrate it effectively into their broader growth strategy.

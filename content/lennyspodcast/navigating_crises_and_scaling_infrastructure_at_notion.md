Notion, co-founded by Ivan Zhao, has demonstrated remarkable resilience and strategic foresight in [[company_growth_and_scaling_challenges | navigating the challenges of scaling]] a technology company. This journey has involved overcoming significant early setbacks and adopting a disciplined approach to growth and infrastructure.

## The Lost Years: Early Iterations and Technical Rebuilds
The initial three to four years of Notion, starting in 2013, are described by Ivan Zhao as "the lost years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The first version aimed to be a developer tool that would allow anyone to create software easily, but the team soon learned that most people didn't care about building their own software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. It took Notion two years to pivot to building a productivity tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, essentially hiding their vision of universal software creation within a more accessible form factor, like "sugar" hiding "broccoli" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

During this period, Notion rebuilt its codebase multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. They initially bet on an unstable technology (Google's Web Component) which led to unpredictable bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This necessitated a complete rewrite of the codebase and a "reset" of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This difficult decision involved laying off all five employees, leaving only Zhao and his co-founder Simon last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. To manage financially, Zhao's mother helped kickstart the company and later provided a bridge loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. The co-founders even sub-leased their apartment and office, moving to Japan to save money while tirelessly coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### The COVID Database Crisis
Another critical moment occurred during COVID-19. Notion experienced rapid growth, but its infrastructure, which relied on a single PostgreSQL database instance, struggled to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. The company faced a "Doomsday Clock," risking a complete shutdown if they ran out of space to store user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.

> "for the longest time we notion runs on one instance of postris database and we then we find a b machine we keep scrolling find a beier beier machine to scale our user base but then we're running off the even the largest instance there is for it post so there's a Doomsday Clock that when we're going to trly run out this space to store everything in notion and notion got completely shut down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>

All engineers halted new feature development to focus solely on solving this problem, which involved sharding the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>. This crisis highlighted the importance of anticipating scalability needs, despite a preference for avoiding premature optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.

## Strategies for Lean Growth and Infrastructure
Notion's approach to [[company_growth_and_scaling_challenges | scaling]] has been characterized by a commitment to staying lean and efficient:

*   **Profitability and Capital Efficiency:** Notion has been profitable for several years and has not spent most of the capital it has raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. This financial stability allows them to focus on product building rather than constantly seeking new funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.
*   **Delayed Hiring:** Notion did not hire its first salesperson until reaching over $10 million in ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>, and its first Product Manager was hired when the company had approximately 50 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. This reflects a belief that better systems and tools can reduce the need for extensive human resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Talent Density:** The company prioritizes "talent density" rather than simply the number of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. This focus ensures that the team remains small, high-performing, and reduces internal communication overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
*   **"Small Bus" Metaphor:** Internally, Notion uses the metaphor of a "small bus." A smaller bus is easier to maneuver, accelerate, and turn corners, emphasizing agility and efficient decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

## Product Philosophy and Future Scaling
Notion's core philosophy revolves around creating a "meta tool" or "Lego for software," which enables users to build their own tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. This [[product_operations_and_scaling_product_management | horizontal product]] strategy comes with its own [[company_growth_and_scaling_challenges | scaling challenges]] and opportunities:

*   **Balancing Vision and User Needs:** Early on, Notion struggled by building what the founders wanted rather than what users needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. The shift to a productivity tool demonstrated the need to package a grand vision within a format people already understood and cared about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **The "Lego Brick" vs. "Lego Box" Mindset:** For individual users, the modular "Lego bricks" (fundamental building blocks like relational databases) are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>. However, when moving upmarket to B2B and enterprise customers, Notion realized the need to offer "Lego boxes" â€“ pre-made solutions that address specific business needs like project management or CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.
*   **Impact of AI:** The advent of large language models (LLMs) is seen as a "gift" for tool builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>. Notion's horizontal nature, with all information centralized, provides a rich dataset for AI capabilities like writing assistance and Q&A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>. The most fascinating aspect is how AI can help "piece things together," simplifying the process of building complex solutions from Notion's Lego blocks, addressing the historical challenge of users struggling to assemble custom setups from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
*   **Bundling and Unbundling Cycles:** Ivan Zhao notes that markets operate in cycles of bundling and unbundling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>. Notion, as a horizontal platform, positions itself in the current bundling trend, offering multiple use cases (like project management, docs, and CRM) in one place, saving cost and centralizing data <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>. This is particularly advantageous for AI, as centralized data is more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.

Product development, particularly in the B2B SaaS space, can often appear to prioritize feature accumulation over a cohesive, user-centric experience. However, companies like Linear demonstrate that a deliberate approach to [[thinking_ creatively_in_business | creativity]] and [[importance_of_design_in_product_development | design]] can lead to deeply beloved and rapidly growing products.

## The Relationship Between Speed and Quality
A common misconception in product development is the perceived trade-off between speed and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Instead of rushing or being sloppy, true speed in a high-quality environment stems from competence and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Experts at the pinnacle of their craft often produce high-quality work quickly because it's "second nature" to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Speed in product development translates to rapid iteration and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>
> What it really looks like is by you know you have some rough time budget for how long you think something's going to take and by the time 10% of it has passed you have a workable solution.
This early, workable solution tests key hypotheses, allowing teams to quickly identify incorrect assumptions without waiting until 80% of the work is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This approach relies on:
*   **Talented Engineers:** Capable of creating workable solutions without getting bogged down by every design choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **No Expectation of Perfection:** The first version is a best guess, not necessarily great, and frees the team from perfectionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Early User Feedback:** Initial versions are shared with internal users, then beta customer groups, to gather real validation and see if users engage with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

[!TIP]
To move faster without cutting quality, embrace the attitude that the first version won't be perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This reduces the need for pixel-perfect designs or solving all UI bugs initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The focus is on having working software that addresses the core problem and allows for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## Preventing Product Bloatedness and Prioritizing Users
A common criticism of successful software is that it eventually becomes bloated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Linear actively combats this by having a clear policy on feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Saying No to Customization for Middle Managers:** Linear absolutely says no to customization features requested by middle managers primarily for reporting purposes, especially if they worsen individual contributor (IC) workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This is a core promise of Linear, ensuring the product remains fast and enjoyable to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing IC Experience:** The rationale is that if the IC experience is poor, they will disengage, leading to inaccurate data and ineffective reporting anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. The product aims to solve core problems effectively for those directly doing the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

[[proximity_to_customers_in_product_design | Proximity to customers in product design]] means tying feature discussions back to specific, real people and their workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. This avoids building elegant solutions that don't match messy reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. Instead of generalized needs, focus on concrete use cases from identified users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

## Understanding Customer Emotion and "Schlep Blindness"
A crucial aspect of [[building_customercentric_products_through_design | building customer-centric products]] is understanding the emotional valence behind customer requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. Product managers should aim to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. This involves digging deep into customer calls, beyond surface-level requests, to uncover the underlying frustration or pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

This approach helps uncover "schlep blindness" â€“ the tendency for individuals to become accustomed to daily annoyances and not even realize they are feeling bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. By understanding these emotional hooks, products can solve deeper, often overlooked problems. An example from Linear is their triage management feature, which automates the process of routing issues, addressing the manual effort and "out of control" feeling many teams experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

## Systematized Creativity and Exploring Extremes
To foster [[thinking_creatively_in_business | creativity]] and discover non-obvious solutions, Linear employs a systematized approach: asking "how extreme can you take it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. This involves exploring the most outrageous version of a solution along a particular trait, discarding constraints like cost or practicality initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

The goal is to expand the "search space" of possibilities and identify choices that might otherwise be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>. This means building and testing extreme versions of features early on, even if they're not the final answer. The learning derived from these extreme experiments provides significant insight into the optimal solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>
> Let's talk about an example of this because this feels awesome yeah I I can I can talk to an example actually is it okay if I I demo something absolutely let's do it show and tell let do that right now here we go we're gonna share screen all right um so this is just like a like a demo space uh instead of linear so the the the feature where we did this that I I remember very clearly cuz it was kind of recent um is we built this uh this feature to save drafts for your issues right so linear you know as hard as an issue tracker if I if I make a new issue uh and let's say I I'm you know trying to report a bug or something right so it's like I make a bug report then uh you know I might start thinking through like okay what are the Repro steps and then I start typing them and this happens all the time right when you're at work you're doing this and someone distracts you someone pings you on slack or you have to go to a meeting or something like that you're like I got to put this away for a second I'll come back to it later like you know note the self you know figure out the actual Repro steps and do it so like what can you do like well you want to save it as a draft so we're like okay this is the this is the problem and the first uh version of this right we like the most what do we want to do like linear is about being fast so we don't want to get in your way we want to say like what is the fastest draft saving experience possible right so if you save it as draft you can save it as draft if you decide to not you want to throw it away you don't want it uh just hit the x button and we'll just throw it away right we're not going to like interrupt you with a popup that says like do you want to save your changes or any of that kind of stuff right we will just absolutely get out of your way fast as possible so we're like what's the risk here well it might feel really unsafe right if we if if you close this and we we don't like ask if if you want a save change you might feel like oh I just lost my changes on accident we knew that going in right we built this anyway and uh yeah it felt super unsafe right it turns out that you know that that that sort of inkling that we had was true right but and we really felt exactly how how unsafe it was uh so then we were like okay well what's the what's the safest thing we could possibly do right the safest thing is just autosave everything right so you start you start a new you know a issue and then you start typing some stuff and it's just like autoing as soon as you type A Single Character and uh that that did feel quite safe so cool um but it also ended up like leaving behind like a whole bunch of you know uh like a paper trail of things you change your mind about right like you've probably had this happen in like uh document tools where you have a whole bunch of things in your in your space called like Untitled document or like new document or stuff like that it's just like so many Untitled folders yeah so many untitle folders right it's CU yeah because the moment you like say new folder it like starts saving it and then you don't actually mean for that to happen so uh so you know we we we had those two sorts of variations that we built and we we felt through and uh where we ended up was like a sort of balance between those two right and so what happens is if I uh if I'm creating a new issue like I am here uh and I close it out it'll it'll interrupt me we're like look we have to interrupt you otherwise it feels too unsafe so I can save the draft right I can go to my drafts and then if I'm in this sort of draft I've already made and I go in there and I you know and I start to say okay I'm going to keeping on it but then I get interrupted again then I'm just going to Auto it for you there's no there's no point I'm not going to ask you again I'm always going to sa because I'm not going to create a like a new object I'm just making modifications in place so we made this sort of very specific choice of like on a brand new issue we will interrupt you and then on a existing draft that you're messing around with we're just going to Auto saave everything and someone doing a uh a sort of analysis right if they like a detailed tear down of of these decisions they might make they might say like wow they they made very specific choices here but the path to get there is to do something totally extreme in One Direction and then totally extreme in another Direction and then find where they they really meet such a good example the way that you described it is you went like here's the safest route here's the fastest version uh where did you come up with these list of options and for folks that are trying to do this for their company are these like because these are linear principles like we're going to be very fast is this like the way you think most companies should operate these sorts of attributes you think it's like specific to what makes their product different how do you think about that I I think for a lot of companies it's you have to you know ask like what is the what is the promise that your your product or your business is making people you know it might be you always have a car available if you need it and if you do that then like maybe we're going to have to implement search pricing to make that happen right like it's just it's always going to be available so here's here's the trade-off that we have to make it's like a very extreme point of view to do that or you might say like the price is always predictable but sometimes you can't have a car in the first place like those are all sort of choices that you get to make and you you kind of have to sort of decide like where in that Spectrum does it make sense you know based on the promise of your company a lot of people talk about this idea of working backwards FR JB was a big concept of working backwards from the ideal let's design the best possible scenario and work backwards uh I love that this is even more tactical which is just pick the extreme version of very specific attributes probably not the sing not the ideal but probably not the sing not the ideal but it'll give us insight into a version of the ideal and an element that works well and then what doesn't yeah exactly I I did this a lot actually atbb just like testing the extreme uh so it super resonates this idea and when you say test so was it like you build it and play with it do you roll it out to like some of these Circles of users or is it often just internal and then you like learn and then iterate yeah we we we roll out some of these versions to to people so the the the the super fast version that was a little that was unsafe that only went internal and everyone felt it was too unsafe but then then we like okay let's go to super safe version and then we roll that out and everyone started having a whole bunch of and we did the like how how many drafts are people making like this is too many like the people are leaving behind like this crazy paper trail okay we gotta we got to figure out some some some difference here amazing so this very much connects to your first point of get some get things out really quick and in this case it's like extreme versions you're probably not going to that are not going to work long term but it will teach you yeah exactly amazing okay and seeing it in action I'm like okay obviously this is the solution that's how the way this should feel yeah and to your point it was not an obvious solution when you started thinking about it yeah I mean the best Solutions are always obvious in hindsight right and it's just like you have to develop a a process internally that to eventually find your way there something else that you've mentioned when we were chatting that connects to some of the things we've been talking about is you have this perspective that B2B software isn't just solving people's problems it's also teaching them how to work and it's kind of this like accumulation of information talk about that because I thought that was really fascinating you know I I I think like if you think about how a lot of B2B software gets created it's because there was some person in the middle of some giant company who implemented some kind of process and they're like wow this process is really working for us maybe we should make it easier and they build a little tool internally and then like all of their you know colleagues can now like press on button and good things happen and then they turn that process and that tool you know they spin it off into a startup and they like make it start this this process repeats thousands of times so when you adopt that tool you're not just adopting like the the actual software you're adopting the idea that this is a practice that you ought to be doing in the first place so you know like if you're if you're a marketing person right and you like you adopt some marketing software you're not just saying like Okay now I can you know kind of write emails and send them to people there's all sorts of process around that like like you you're organizing stuff into campaigns you're measuring clickthrough rates you're like calculating you know cost of acquisition and all that stuff probably comes equipped with a tool because those are the right practices to do when you're when you're doing this sort of uh marketing exercise and you know whether you knew about it before right or you learned it from uh from the tool like as a as a buyer for uh for this kind of product what I'm doing is I'm saying like hey I'm going to bring in this Baseline level of marketing competency into my organization right that like this is the worst we can do is whatever the tool defaults are interesting so it's you're basically buy into a way of working when you're adopting a piece of software not just have this problem and need solved yeah exactly and I I I think the the most um the most like Salient example of this is if you've ever seen uh like a like a company adopt like an Erp product it's the most painful thing you can imagine right they have to they have to you know it's doing deep surgery they have to re redo all of their uh internal processes and the way they man inventory and all this kind of stuff but they're willing to do it because they know that this is a battl tested way of making sure that you know you you're actually doing good um like management of of of resources so they're like like we're growing up now it's time for us to adopt these best practices in order to do that we have to adopt this tool and we will conform to whatever the tool is bestes to do this connects a couple things I know about linear one is what you've shared of just avoiding these customizations requests from people like you have a very opinionated way of here's why we here's how you should operate in order to build a great functioning product org and Company in general so I think like I'm just Connecting Threads here one is like we're gonna avoid letting people customize too much because we know they will have a bad time and then two is yeah just this idea of uh we are opinionated about the way you should work in linear and it's like you have a linear method I think it's called of just like here's how product team should operate based on everything we've seen be successful yeah yeah it's it's definitely connected in a way and I I I think sometimes when when people talk about um you mentioned like being opinionated and I think sometimes when people talk about being opinionated it can feel like they're almost saying like hey this is like kind of arbitrary right like your opinion and my opinion they're just two opinions man like like you know neither is right or wrong what we try to do is find where there's actual consensus right amongst a lot of different uh High performing teams and then we can you know take those practices and say like okay for a team that isn't you know already practicing this can we give them a button so that they can start practicing this right when when when the company we see companies like doing a really good job of managing their triage q and but you know it's like you know it's very manual we okay can we automate this and then for this other company that really needs it that they don't know this is what they need can we just give them a button to activate this and now they have to practice within their or two so I think a takeaway here is when you choose a tool uh recognize it's going to change the way you operate and be thoughtful about is this the way we want to work versus just we just have a problem we once solved yeah exactly I want to come back to something kind of a thread that's come up a couple times in our chat is the the way you collaborate uh internally it feels like there's a pretty unique way you you said you're on all the sales calls is there anything that you can share about how you collaborate internally how the different functions collaborate that may be unlike how other companies operate that might be helpful for them to learn from yes something that's worked really really well for us is uh we think of product management as as partially like a go to market discipline in the same way that sales and marketing are right like when when you talk to people and like hey like tell me how product management works in your company they'll probably say something about like well there's engineering product and design they work in this Triad and here's you know here's how they they interact and collaborate and we all kind of understand why that's useful why it's helpful uh but this sort of other form of collaboration between product management uh sales and marketing I think it's something that's like probably um really UND examined and often know often I I feel like in organizations you actually see kind of like some antagonism between product and and like sales and marketing and I think that's kind of a shame right because you know when when we uh come kind of come together the way we think about um you know the the way that we think about selling is a matter of like especially because we sell to we sell to very sort of expert practitioners and they have like a they have a very sensitive BS detector right so like we like a big part of what we try to do is we try to help them pick um which I help our marketing team like pick exactly like the right word and the right phrasing to make us sound like native to the language that our customers speak and also talk about engineers is my is my my sense right yeah like Engineers is a is a big one but even product managers right like product managers kind of know when you know like they know what the job is like so when you kind of come in you say the wrong words people kind of like give you a give you the stink eye don't call them project managers yeah exactly like for for example so I I think that's a that's a big part of uh you know what we have to do right so like we you know on the on our on our PM team we actually have a full-time product marketer right and her job is to like you know like tactically it's like all the change logs come from her all the release notes right and also like the you know she's she's always crafting the language for whatever upcoming release that we're uh we're building and you know working with directly with the teams and try to figure out how to talk about it and then once we you know go out and build the campaigns um build assets and things like that like that's where that's where a lot of the language is coming from it's coming from the work that she's doing uh and then you know with sales like they're validating all that message like in the field right they're they're saying the words to customers directly and telling you if it's like sticking or not and then you can kind of like you know have a really good feedback cycle uh between those three disciplines what I've seen you uh refer to this way of working as is a double triangle which is I think a complement to like the PM engineer designer talk about that and give us a visual what that looks like yeah I know I I think PMS right like product managers we we often have a a tough time like trying to explain like what what is your job right like you know well it's like a little bit of everything yeah and I I think the you know the job that I sort of uh do right that we see it as is uh you're taking the sort of building side of the organization and the the selling side of the organization bring them together that's you know you're taking all of the commercial like motivations and goals of the company and making sure that what you build it actually solves for those uh those goals and you know you're you're sort of tempering that with like what's you know possible and uh and sort of where the opportunities are to to actually build stuff so I like to me like it's it's the PM in the middle and then you have engineering product design and then sales marketing product management on the other side PM was always in the middle indeed uh but I think that's true from the perspective of PM and I I love I love this visual of just like the PM is connecting the builders to the sellers and you're involved in both worlds this connects very directly to Bri JK's whole thing about how PMS are are should be doing marketing and so the way they changed it are being every PM is also pmm and there's no more they're product marketers now that's their title and that's like the extreme version of what you're describing yeah yeah it is and I think Apple's been doing that way for forever too got it so the advice here is if you're a PM at a B2B business uh lean into the sales and marketing side of it leaning into the go to market yeah and in fact if if you're if you're leaving something on the table right in terms of like the kind of impact that you are having at your job that's probably the thing that you're leaving on the table you're probably already doing a good job of you know collaborating with engineering and uh and design right it's probably the sort of cell side that you're that you're uh you know kind of There's an opportunity for you to have more impact just to make it even more concrete for PMS that are like okay I want to do this I W to I want to do what linear is doing I'm going to get more sales what does it look like when someone is more uh is in this double triangle working more closely with sales you talked about being on sales calls what else there can you share of just like here try these things I I think originate the message that you uh that you sent to your audience right like there's a lot of things that marketing does which you're never going to necessarily touch right there's always like demand gen and figuring out channel strategy and all this kind of stuff like sure right that's a pure marketing concern but actually picking the words and what where the emphasis is like you should understand the customer at a pretty deep level probably deeper than any other uh like group at the company because you know because of the the kinds of requirements Gathering discovery that you're doing so you're going to f you're going to know the native language that your customer speaks a lot better and uh know help your marketing team originate those words got it so basically be really involved in the in the product marketing the writing the the emails the headlines the website yeah yeah exactly and it's I I know like the word product marketing is also so overloaded they do so many different things and but that it's that sort of like content you know kind of creation piece that's uh that you really have an opportunity to contribute to yeah I love how concrete that is it's like don't think about this concept product marketing just think about the words that your potential customers and customers see okay uh final area I want to spend a little time on is totally different it's around getting a job oh yeah okay you have a pretty unique uh approach to finding a gig uh I heard from the founder of mode about the very unique appro way you approached getting a job there I imagine linear is a similar boat uh what what advice can you share with folks that are looking for a job maybe struggling that worked for you when you were looking for your next gig product management is a kind of a unique role right like because we do just about everything there you don't really get pigeon hold into you know being sort of compared along a single Dimension with everyone else and everyone who's hiring PMS just like when they're hiring execs they're they're they're kind of hoping that they bring them on to solve some burning problem that they they have and uh so it's your job when you're in the in the interview process to figure out what that burning problem is right so like put on your your your Discovery hat right and go figure out like what is the actual sort of like job to be done of the hiring manager when they're bringing on a new PM onto their team and if you can do that right and then make a good case that you are the person to solve that problem then hiring you becomes a sort of like binary choice between do I hire the solution to my problem or do I hire someone else and and I think what what ends up happening a lot is when we're you know when you're in a uh interview process you're just like trying to put your best foot forward trying to say that you're you're great at everything you have like very few weaknesses maybe you try too hard like whatever it is right and and then you but everyone's going to say that so you're just like one of in people and you want to make yourself a little bit of like just you versus the field right like you are the solution to a problem and then everyone else is a you know sort of like a a rule of the dice so the way you're describing it is uh the company has a job to be done say it's Drive growth of some feature uh in this case it's like for just building a killer success ful B2B product I don't know that's that's a broad one like usually you're not interviewing for head a product role so that's maybe too broad so it's like what is this PM rolls job to be done at the company and then help convince them you are the best person to solve to do that job and solve this problem for them yeah and and a lot of times when you when you take that approach it'll feel like you already work there right and like the the way that I I I did this I got advice from a friend he said like I was interviewing for this job at mode that you that you uh referenced and I'm like how should I approach it he's like just act like you already worked there what would you do and uh and then it's like okay I could do that so then when you're in this interview process and someone um you know you know someone's asking you a question they goes you have any questions for me like you can ask them like what are your okrs this quarter how can someone help you achieve those right you can like be that specific about like they're like oh yeah sure I can tell you about like the exact thing that I'm doing this quarter and then then you'll have some level of intelligence about like what's you know what people are actually trying to solve uh because I think often we just like get stuck like in these very high level General types of questions like what what are you know what's the company goal all that kind of stuff and it's like no you can get really specific like if you were collaborating with that person in your job like what would you say to them I love how actionable this advice is there's obviously an element of like this takes work and time uh a lot of people are interviewing at a lot of companies trying to find a job uh is part of your advice like pick the ones you're most excited about and invest invest a lot of time in in this in this way of interviewing you know you you can invest a lot in the ones where you know that you're going to be able to overdeliver on right if you understand what they're actually trying to solve then you know where you're going to have a both a highest chance of success of getting hired but also like doing a really great job on the other end of it and you talk about how like pretending you have the job pretend you actually have this job as part of the interview process uh often times as an outsider you don't have enough information to like have a really good thought on what the solution is and maybe part of it is going to be so like wrong because you're like I don't actually know I don't have the data do you actually try to reach out to the engineers and designers on the team to try to understand things how far do you go to try to solve these problems and show them what you can do yeah I mean you know you're in the interview Loop right these are people that you're going to be working closely with so start start there right do do your Discovery questions and uh if there's an area that you think you want to dig you can ask you right there's there's there's no har asking hey can you put me in touch with an engineering manager who's like working on the same problem and and you know if if no one else is asking again you're going to have an extra piece of feedback from that in manager and say yeah like this guy asked like really good questions and it seems like they're you know they're really with it like no one else is gonna have that piece of feedback so during the during the debrief process and just asking that question alone will show them how deeply you're thinking about this already yeah amazing nonan is there anything else that we have not covered that you want to touch on or share or you think might be helpful to listeners before we get to a very exciting lightning round uh you know I I I have a very round uh you know I I I have a very specific uh point of view on deadlines I don't know if that's a fire away you I I I think like what often happens is people get depressed about deadlines right it's like hey here's the here's the ship date and then you never make it you know I don't know if you you've had this feeling before uh you you were an engineer before too right so it's just like Engineers is better like oh yeah yeah deadlines they're just they're they're complete Fabrications um and the only way to make deadlines real is to take them so seriously that they are basically like a pzero problem and like everything else has to not matter in comparison to the deadline because that that's the that's the only way you're going to be able to signal to the team and also to all the stakeholders that you're actually taking it seriously so you know my my feeling on deadlines is don't have too many of them right and when you do uh it's a p zero so the engineers working on it they don't get to work on anything else like someone's oh I need them for this like don't nope you're not pulling them off of anything we're doing this uh as a PM your job is just cut as much scope as possible to make it possible to hit that deadline right like what are the things actually blocking us from doing it because what what you want to do is at the moment where you have to make the go no go call on whether the ship you want to be able to actually have a product that you can say yes to right it doesn't it might not have all the features you had wanted or whatever it is and you can say no right you can make that choice but you want to set yourself up uh to be in a position where you can actually say yes or no to something cuz like what often happens is like we want this thing well it's not even close to being done yet so there's no possible way we can say yes right I can't ship it it's just it's it's like half broken it's like no no no you want to get to a point where it works right it might not be the product that you want but it is an actual real product that you can conceivably ship so you said that uh don't have too many deadlines but when you do make sure you everyone understands these are actual deadlines uh when do you decide it's worth having a deadline is it like a marketing launch sort of thing what's worthy of a deadline in your experience yeah it's it's it's usually having to do with some kind of external uh marketing type of exercise that you're you're trying to trying to hit got it and uh and I I think that that's like the other thing that I I think as as Builders we we we can often look at like launch dates and stuff like that it's like oh you know who cares if it's a little bit later or we skip this this change log or whatever it is and I think that that's you you know that's that's really uh I don't know it makes me go crazy when I hear people say that in in all honesty um you know I I with with marketing communication customers you basically have a limited amount of of opportunities to do so right a year is 365 days there are 12 months right each of those months has about four weeks like there's some Rhythm where you get to have 50ish weeks to say something to your audience you know once a week or you get to have 12 months to say something really big or four quarters to say something huge if you miss one of those opportunities you don't get it back again you can't like time travel back and say like okay actually let's redo first quarter and like say this message that we wish we we could have gotone down to the into the field that is such a powerful Point uh I could see the sales uh marketing go to market element of your job coming out there uh I imagine everyone that's in that feeli is like yes this is exactly right maybe just a last question along this line so I love this idea of taking deadlines very seriously when you commit to a deadline at the same time as you pointed out creates a lot of stress knowing there's a deadline we have to hit so one lever you mentioned is cutting scope another is just people spending more time estimating to have more accurate deadlines you invest in that how do you think about just like for an engineering team to commit to a deadline how much to spend on like drisking and estimating versus just let's just do our best and then we'll cut and adjust you know this this this might be my hotake but we do almost no estimating in order to hit deadlines what we what we do right is we ship as early as we can so if if you know the thing we talked about earlier were like if by the time that 10% of the time has elapsed you have a working thing you can now spend the rest of the time deciding whether or not you want to do another iteration or you want to polish that thing and get it to be a shipable state right so you're you're you're kind of setting up your future self to be able to make that decision so none of this is you know you you you can't you can't go into this at the at the very last moment say like okay now we have to take the deadline seriously right you kind of have to do it from the beginning and commit to the process of going very fast iterating early and then putting yourself in a position where you can say yes or no to a product so interesting and so different from the way most companies operate uh Nan this was everything I was hoping it be I think this is going to help a lot of people build much better product uh which would be good for the world if more products are like linear with that we reached our very exciting lightning round uh are you ready uh yeah let's do it okay let's do it okay first question what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people I I think the one book that I recommend the most is uh the Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman I read it originally in college for an HCI class I was taking and I think of of everything I've ever read it's the thing that sort of caused me to see the world from the perspective of everything you interact with is a product right every single you know every pencil that you use every door that you open is a is a product that somebody designed and is that is that the big takeaway from that book because it comes up a lot and I think and it's such an old book and so I guess for someone that hasn't read or maybe doesn't have time to readed is the big takeaway for you uh someone designed everything and there's a reason things aren't great and and they can be improved yeah I mean I I I saw this the other day I was at a cafe uh in my neighborhood and I saw a kid rip a handle off a door like of the cafe he like pulled it so hard it came right off because it was a push door but it had a handle that looked like you could pull it and that's that's like one of the canonical examples of the book is Mysteries yeah awesome uh next question do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed uh I've uh I watched the Diplomat on on Netflix I think it was um terrific you know it's really fun easy easy watch it has like some like West Wing Vibes if you were into that back in the day yeah have you seen the second season uh yeah I finished the second season yeah I wasn't as excited about the second season just to put that out there the first season was really good and then just kind of went off a little like okay I guess I guess it's cool but yeah it got a little uh like spy Thriller I think yeah yeah okay cool but still really good and on Netflix okay cool do have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like I didn't Discover it but I discovered a a version of it that was really interesting um there's a there's a pen uh actually I have I have one on my desk it's like it's called like the Sakura Micron I don't know if you use these it's like a felt tip pen it's really great right like you know it was originally invented like in Japan for like artists to like draw like like comic book books and stuff and uh you know you can use it for anything you I use it for journaling or whatever um but I I I was on Amazon I was looking you know I was trying to buy more and I found a package that said like a Bible study kit I was like why is why is this labeled Bible study kit and it was it was literally just the pen and like in like four different colors and it was because like the thing doesn't bleed through pages so if you have like a Bible which they often have these kind of like really flimsy kind of newsprint pages it's not going to bleed through and uh and it's just really interesting to me that someone marketed like a normal package of these pens as a Bible study kit and for people who like were looking for that keyword and it's like it was like official too it was not some something hacked together it was like actually like an official packaging of this amazing what a unique pen Choice two more questions do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life the the correct amount is too much minus one and I think this this like kind of ties into like the try the extreme version of it of a thing where I don't know like a stupid example like how much pizza do you want to eat it's like well five slices was too many I feel bad then four was probably the right number right and then if you want to find the right number sometimes you just have to like really shoot for the edge and then find out what's too much and then you'll find out exactly what the right amount is I love how tactical that is uh makes me think about Elon musk's thing about cutting things like one of his formulas for just getting stuff done one of them is just like cut stuff before trying to optimize it and and uh and automate it and his advice is if you don't bring back 10% of things you cut you're not cutting enough yeah exactly final question you worked at everlane for a number of years and uh you shared the rough idea of a story around a shirt maybe our bestseller that they have now uh and how you helped create a bestselling women's shirt can you share that story uh yeah so I mean to be to be clear I I I witnessed the creation I don't I don't think I had a direct hand in it but um uh yeah so you know I I I saw this advertisement the other day uh on Instagram for for it's called the women's box Cut tea and it's it's a it's a t-shirt that's like kind of wide and and short right for women and uh and I I looked and they had like 20 colors of it and it's like I and it's it sells super well and I remember when we when we created this thing and it was because there was a batch of um defective men's t-shirts they all came in like an inch and a half too short and so like we couldn't sell them right you would have your your belly button sticking out like no one wants aware of that and uh and then so what we we did was like we had to salvage the inventory because we were a very small company and we had to make cash flow and you know we couldn't just we couldn't just damage it out so uh so you know the the design team and the marketing team kind of came together and they said okay here's what we're gonna do we're gonna cut another two inches off of this and make it really cropped right and Market it towards women as like a cropped boxy silhouette and uh and we and we we did that we're like okay hopefully you know hopefully we can we can salvage this this inventory and not have to like take a write down it sold out in like a week and I like oh okay I guess we just made a hit product and it's it's like one of these things where uh it's very hard to know what this was right was this like a marketing thing was this a design thing I don't know but you just kind of come together and you you you find like the right product Market fit in like the weirdest way I love that it's still going yeah it's still going like originally it was just white now there's like 20 Colors oh man I love how many Industries you have worked in fashion data analytics project management I don't know what's next there's more I imagine Nan this was incredible I really appreciate making time for this like I said I think we're going to have helped a lot of people build better products two final questions where can folks finding online if they want to reach out and learn more and how can listeners be useful to you yeah uh I'm I'm on x/ Twitter as the the nonu it's th and then my name um and uh you know if they have any uh feedback about linear uh you know we're we're very happy to take it um especially you know for people who kind of like use it in their uh in their day-to-day we want to hear from uh from users what's the best way for them to share that is it tweet at you is it go to the website what do you recommend oh yeah you can tweet at us you can uh you can

Product development, particularly in the B2B SaaS space, can often appear to prioritize feature accumulation over a cohesive, user-centric experience. However, companies like Linear demonstrate that a deliberate approach to [[thinking_creatively_in_business | creativity]] and [[importance_of_design_in_product_development | design]] can lead to deeply beloved and rapidly growing products.

## The Relationship Between Speed and Quality
A common misconception in product development is the perceived trade-off between speed and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Instead of rushing or being sloppy, true speed in a high-quality environment stems from competence and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Experts at the pinnacle of their craft often produce high-quality work quickly because it's "second nature" to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Speed in product development translates to rapid iteration and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

> What it really looks like is by you know you have some rough time budget for how long you think something's going to take and by the time 10% of it has passed you have a workable solution. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>

This early, workable solution tests key hypotheses, allowing teams to quickly identify incorrect assumptions without waiting until 80% of the work is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This approach relies on:
*   **Talented Engineers:** Capable of creating workable solutions without getting bogged down by every design choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **No Expectation of Perfection:** The first version is a best guess, not necessarily great, and frees the team from perfectionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Early User Feedback:** Initial versions are shared with internal users, then beta customer groups, to gather real validation and see if users engage with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

[!TIP]
To move faster without cutting quality, embrace the attitude that the first version won't be perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This reduces the need for pixel-perfect designs or solving all UI bugs initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The focus is on having working software that addresses the core problem and allows for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## Preventing Product Bloatedness and Prioritizing Users
A common criticism of successful software is that it eventually becomes bloated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Linear actively combats this by having a clear policy on feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

*   **Saying No to Customization for Middle Managers:** Linear absolutely says no to customization features requested by middle managers primarily for reporting purposes, especially if they worsen individual contributor (IC) workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This is a core promise of Linear, ensuring the product remains fast and enjoyable to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing IC Experience:** The rationale is that if the IC experience is poor, they will disengage, leading to inaccurate data and ineffective reporting anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. The product aims to solve core problems effectively for those directly doing the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

[[proximity_to_customers_in_product_design | Proximity to customers in product design]] means tying feature discussions back to specific, real people and their workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. This avoids building elegant solutions that don't match messy reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. Instead of generalized needs, focus on concrete use cases from identified users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

## Understanding Customer Emotion and "Schlep Blindness"
A crucial aspect of [[building_customercentric_products_through_design | building customer-centric products through design]] is understanding the emotional valence behind customer requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. Product managers should aim to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. This involves digging deep into customer calls, beyond surface-level requests, to uncover the underlying frustration or pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

This approach helps uncover "schlep blindness" â€“ the tendency for individuals to become accustomed to daily annoyances and not even realize they are feeling bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. By understanding these emotional hooks, products can solve deeper, often overlooked problems. An example from Linear is their triage management feature, which automates the process of routing issues, addressing the manual effort and "out of control" feeling many teams experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

## Systematized Creativity and Exploring Extremes
To foster [[thinking_creatively_in_business | creativity]] and discover non-obvious solutions, Linear employs a systematized approach: asking "how extreme can you take it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. This involves exploring the most outrageous version of a solution along a particular trait, discarding constraints like cost or practicality initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

The goal is to expand the "search space" of possibilities and identify choices that might otherwise be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>. This means building and testing extreme versions of features early on, even if they're not the final answer. The learning derived from these extreme experiments provides significant insight into the optimal solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

A practical example is Linear's draft saving feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. They explored two extremes:
1.  **Fastest Draft Saving:** No pop-ups, immediate discard on exit. This felt "super unsafe" to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.
2.  **Safest Draft Saving:** Autosave everything. While safe, it led to a "paper trail" of unwanted drafts, similar to "Untitled document" files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
The final solution was a balance: prompt to save a new draft, but autosave existing drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. This specific choice emerged from experiencing both extremes. This approach ties into [[creating_a_remarkable_product | creating a remarkable product]].

## B2B Software: Teaching a Way of Working
When adopting B2B software, companies aren't just buying a tool; they are buying into a way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>. Products embed best practices and processes, offering a "baseline level of competency" in a particular domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. This explains why companies might undergo painful ERP implementations â€“ they are conforming to a battle-tested method of resource management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>.

Linear is opinionated about how product teams should operate, based on observed success in high-performing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>. This intentional design philosophy avoids excessive customization, which can lead to negative user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. This perspective highlights the [[understanding_company_cultures_impact_on_product_development | understanding company cultures impact on product development]].

## Product Management as a Go-to-Market Discipline
Product management at Linear is viewed partly as a "go-to-market discipline," similar to sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>. This "double triangle" model connects the "building" side (engineering, product, design) with the "selling" side (sales, marketing, product management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

Product managers are encouraged to:
*   **Originate the message:** Leverage their deep customer understanding to craft precise language for marketing and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>. This ensures messaging resonates with the native language of the customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Collaborate closely:** Work with product marketers on change logs and release notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>, and with sales to validate messaging in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. This integrated approach is essential for [[category_design_in_product_development | category design in product development]].

## Deadlines and Commitment
Deadlines, particularly for external marketing launches, should be treated as "P0 problems" (highest priority) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.
*   **Few but Serious:** Companies should have few deadlines, but when they do, engineers should be fully dedicated, and PMs should ruthlessly cut scope to hit the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.
*   **Missed Opportunities:** Missing a launch opportunity is a permanent loss, as marketing communication opportunities are limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.
*   **Early Shipping over Estimation:** Instead of extensive estimation, focus on shipping a working product as early as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. This enables making informed decisions about further iteration or polishing, setting up the team for success at the go/no-go call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.

## Unintended Innovation
Sometimes, innovative products arise from unexpected situations. An example from Everlane is the creation of a best-selling women's "Box Cut Tee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>. This product was initially conceived to salvage a batch of defective men's t-shirts that were too short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>. By cutting another two inches off and marketing them as a cropped, boxy silhouette for women, the company turned a liability into a highly successful product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>. This highlights how design and marketing can collaborate to find "product-market fit in the weirdest way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>. This also illustrates the importance of [[building_taste_and_design_acuity_in_digital_products | building taste and design acuity in digital products]] in unexpected ways.

Growth is a relatively new field, often associated with "growth hacks"â€”surefire ways to achieve rapid growth, especially in the social media age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, many shared tips and tricks are out of context or specific to one example, making them unreliable patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions and Failed Tactics

Many initiatives that companies invest heavily in for growth simply do not work.

### Rebranding and Redesigning for Growth

One common misconception is that a rebrand or a redesign, especially of a marketing site, will produce good performance results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This is often a favorite tactic of new CMOs who design the website or brand as a reflection of their [[the_significance_of_personal_branding | personal taste]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Promises of increased acquisition rarely materialize into anything meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

> "Never ever once have I seen a Rebrand or redesign especially of you your marketing site produce good performance results." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
> "It never materializes into anything meaningful because again if you're doing it as a step towards unlocking new Global Maxima sure I love that do it go after it know that you have a ton of work ahead of you in order to actually unlock that Global Maxima but to promise a homepage redesign or marketing site redesign in order to drive more acquisition is a failed promise..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>

### When Rebranding is Considered

There are legitimate reasons to rebrand or redesign, such as entering a new market, a new category, or when the product has evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. However, these are often lagging indicators that something *needs* to change, not a direct driver of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Expectations and Reality

A rebrand is typically a "stepping stone back" in performance, requiring significant optimization to reach or surpass previous results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. It's often a costly endeavor, involving millions of dollars in agency fees and 8-10 months of development, leading to "very lackluster results afterwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

Even product redesigns, like changing a logo or colors, consume immense product and engineering resources with no guaranteed results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

> "Every single time I've seen a marketing site at least Rebrand it's been a step back in performance that then is being treated as a fire drill to fix." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>

### Recommendations for Rebranding

*   **Go in with "eyes wide open"**: Understand that a rebrand is unlikely to drive immediate growth, but might set up for future brand positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Model for a performance hit**: Expect a decline in metrics post-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **Plan for post-launch optimization**: Allocate 2-3 months (ideally 6) after launch to optimize the new design and recover performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid treating it as a "pattern"**: If a rebrand *does* work, it's an outlier, not a repeatable strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Other Non-Working Tactics

*   **Color optimizations**: Testing shades of colors is a dated tactic that yields no significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Third-party sign-ups**: Adding options like Google or Facebook OAuth rarely drives incremental acquisition; it mostly shifts user preference for existing sign-up methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. The exception is developer products that naturally integrate with platforms like GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   **One-off emails**: Stressing over a single email's impact is unproductive; email should be considered a series of communications interacting with product communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>.
*   **Obsession with removing friction**: While addressing "horrible friction" and cognitive load is important, simply removing steps or oversimplifying to the point of losing product identity is a failed [[growth_hacking_as_a_sustainable_business_strategy | growth strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. "Simplifying onboarding" is an action, not a problem; the real problem is confusion or lack of education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.

## Broader Growth Considerations

*   **Hiring a [[hiring_for_growth_roles | Growth Team]] too soon**: Startups often mistakenly believe they need a [[growth_teams_and_misconceptions | growth team]] to kickstart growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Founders and founding teams must first achieve [[Product Market Fit and Growth Strategy | product Market fit]] and organically grow to significant revenue (e.g., $1-10 million ARR) before a dedicated growth team is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Growth teams optimize existing growth, they don't *create* it if core product or marketing issues exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Over-reliance on external channels**: Growth teams should prioritize building "owned" or "earned" channels (e.g., virality, word-of-mouth, user-generated content) rather than solely relying on paid channels like SEO, SEM, or social media, which are subject to algorithms and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>.
*   **Evolving growth models**: A growth model that works initially won't last forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. Companies need to continuously overlay different [[productled growth | growth models]] (product-led, marketing-led, sales-led) to diversify and avoid hitting the "law of shitty click-throughs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Plan to introduce new growth loops or channels every 18 months, with major shifts every five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "unique problem" syndrome**: Most growth problems have been encountered and solved by others. Seek advice from experts and leverage existing patterns instead of starting from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. Hiring advisors can provide valuable insights and accelerate learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.
*   **Balancing experimentation**: While experimentation is crucial for growth teams, testing every single initiative can paralyze progress and slow down velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Trust intuition for low-volume scenarios and focus precise scientific measurements on high-impact areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>.

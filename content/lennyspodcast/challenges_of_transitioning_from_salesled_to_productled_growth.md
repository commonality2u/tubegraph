The process of evolving a company's growth strategy from a traditional sales-led approach to incorporating or transitioning into [[productled growth strategies | product-led growth]] (PLG) is often misunderstood as a binary choice. However, the most successful companies view it as a "layering game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Layering Game: Not a Switch, But an Overlay

Transitioning from a sales-led model to a [[productled growth strategies | product-led]] one does not mean abandoning the sales-led approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. Instead, it involves hunkering down on the existing sales-led strategy and overlaying [[productled growth strategies | product-led]] initiatives on top of it to amplify existing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. The biggest mistake companies make is viewing this as a decision to switch or pick one over the other, rather than a sequential play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### Risk of Pure Sales-Led Approach

If a company remains exclusively sales-led, there is a high chance of being disrupted by a [[productled growth strategies | product-led]] competitor from the bottom up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This emphasizes the necessity of integrating product-led elements.

## Common Pitfalls in Growth Strategy Integration

While the specific journey of [[transition from productled growth to productled sales | transitioning from product-led growth to product-led sales]] is extensively detailed, the challenges faced when adding new growth motions, regardless of the starting point, offer crucial insights. Companies often fall into a predictable pattern when integrating sales into a product-led foundation, which highlights general dangers when evolving growth models:

*   **Neglecting Original Growth Drivers**: A common mistake is letting go of [[productled growth strategies | product usage growth]] and [[productled growth strategies | product-led]] tactics when chasing larger enterprise deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. This happens because companies prioritize resources (e.g., hiring an Enterprise sales representative over a growth Product Manager or marketer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.
*   **Over-focusing on Enterprise Features**: Product roadmaps may start to focus exclusively on enterprise features, which is a tell-tale sign of letting go of user growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. Continuous innovation and delighting users are essential for them to act as selling agents within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.
*   **Misaligned Incentives and Metrics**: When adding sales, average contract values (ACVs) from [[productled growth strategies | product-led]] self-serve are often lower than those from top-down sales approaches because the account is entered earlier in the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. Companies should not compare these ACVs directly, as they are "apples and oranges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. [[productled sales strategies | Product-led sales]] is an expansion game, not about landing the largest deal from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.

When these mistakes occur, even the sales-led inbound reliant on usage can dry up, leading to a significant slowdown in growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. While many companies eventually correct course, some take too long, allowing competitors to enter the space and leading to a downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

## The Ideal Approach: Executing Both Correctly and Together

The most successful companies, regardless of whether they started [[productled growth strategies | product-led]] or sales-led, are able to execute both strategies correctly and together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This integrated approach simplifies life by acknowledging that both motions will eventually be necessary, making the question merely about where to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

### The Emergence of [[productled sales strategies | Product-Led Sales]]

[[productled sales strategies | Product-led sales]] is seen as the future of growth, predicted to largely replace traditional top-down sales organizations within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>. This model focuses on user value to drive expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.

**Key characteristics of [[productled sales strategies | Product-Led Sales]]**:
*   **User-Centric Value**: It prioritizes the user's experience and value derived from the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.
*   **Lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: The cost of acquiring a user is significantly cheaper than acquiring a buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.
*   **Usage-Driven Pipeline**: Pipeline creation is based on actual product usage, rather than traditional marketing qualified leads (MQLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.
*   **Empowering Users**: The model empowers users to make purchase decisions and act as sales agents within their organizations, shifting the pressure of sales onto the product and its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.
*   **Scoring Based on Usage**: Sales teams get involved when product usage indicates a potential for an entire organization to benefit. This involves scoring users based on volume, velocity, breadth of feature use, behavioral tactics, and demographics to assess the probability of successful sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>.
*   **Organic Lead Generation**: The first motion is to create "hand-raisers" â€“ users who organically complete a sales lead form due to their product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. Subsequent layers involve identifying and "outbounding" to users who show high engagement but haven't raised their hand yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.

This approach ensures that sales enablement material is rooted in the product itself, in contrast to traditional sales-led models that rely heavily on demos and persuasion before product adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## Strategic Product Offerings: Freemium vs. Trials

To support a user-centric growth model, particularly for B2B products, the choice between freemium and trial models is critical.

*   **Freemium**: Allows for ongoing free use of a product with certain feature or usage walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>.
*   **Trial**: Allows for free use but is time-bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

The challenge with time-bound trials is that the time needed to evaluate a product varies greatly by user and organization size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. A 7-day trial, for instance, might work for a small startup but alienate a large enterprise due to internal dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This creates a superficial time component that isn't a good measure of how long it takes to derive value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.

Instead, usage-based freemium models are preferred, as exemplified by MongoDB, which offers a free community cluster for prototyping without time limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

Companies should always have something free and self-service, though it doesn't need to be the entire product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. The strategic reasons for offering freemium include:
*   **Proof of Concept (POC)**: Allowing users to test functionality (e.g., MongoDB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>.
*   **Indirect Monetization**: Driving acquisition through virality or network effects (e.g., Miro's free boards that encourage sharing, SurveyMonkey's free users who drove 100% of acquisition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.
*   **Strategic Landing**: Entering a segment not immediately monetized but with expansion potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.
*   **Addressing Commoditization**: Offering free basics when core features become commoditized, requiring innovation to differentiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.
*   **Product Incubation**: Using freemium as a breeding ground for discovering adjacent use cases and personas to inform the roadmap (e.g., LinkedIn's freemium base enabling paid products like Sales Navigator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.
*   **Data Collection**: Gathering data on freemium users to build and improve products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

Essentially, anything that creates friction for the growth model should be gated in paid versions, while anything that promotes the growth model should be offered for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.

## Hiring for Growth

When building a growth team, especially for the first growth hire or a growth leader, it's often best to look internally first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

### Internal vs. External Hires

*   **Internal Hire**: Favored because [[company growth and scaling challenges | growth]] is an "evolution, not a revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. An internal hire (e.g., a data analyst, existing product manager, or technical engineer) is already familiar with the product and its specific growth model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. They can deliver quicker wins because they understand the authentic and local nature of the product's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>.
*   **External Hire**: Bringing in an external person, especially as the first hire, carries significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. If pressured to accelerate growth immediately, they might "copy-paste" growth models from previous companies, which often leads to failure due to different product functions and market intertwining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.

### When to Hire a Full-Time Growth Person

A full-time growth person should only be brought in once a company has achieved strong [[challenges of achieving product-market fit | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. This means:
1.  **Demonstrable Retention**: At least six months to a year post-initial offering to truly understand customer retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>.
2.  **Ability to Acquire and Monetize**: Evidence of "green shoots" in the ability to drive product distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

Hiring a growth person to *figure out* the growth model from the beginning is a mistake; the founding team should establish the initial growth model themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

### General Tips for Driving Growth

To effectively drive growth, leaders and teams need to:
*   **Find Patterns in Problems**: Understand how to find patterns in the problems being solved to develop repeatable frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. This allows for localized application of frameworks, making it easier to scale and achieve sustainable, repeatable success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.
*   **Minimize Context Switching**: This is key to creating a defensible growth model that fosters a growth culture and mindset across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.
*   **Focus on Frameworks over Success Stories**: Relying on specific success patterns (copy-pasting) has an extremely high failure rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. Instead, invest in creating adaptable frameworks for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>.

By understanding these [[challenges in product organizations | challenges]] and adopting a strategic, adaptive approach, companies can successfully integrate sales and product-led motions to achieve sustained growth.

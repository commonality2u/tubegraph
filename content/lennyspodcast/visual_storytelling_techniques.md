Nancy Duarte, a best-selling author, speaker, and CEO of Duarte Incorporated, emphasizes the critical role of visuals in effective communication. Her company has helped create over 250,000 presentations for influential business leaders and institutions worldwide, including Apple, Google, the World Bank, and Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## The Power of Visuals in Presentations
The ability to present well is not limited to big stage talks; it's crucial for any moment of influence, including meetings and phone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. A key principle in [[crafting_compelling_presentations | crafting compelling presentations]] is asking, "Can they see what I'm saying?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

Visual tools and techniques help audiences process and remember information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

> "You can use something in your talk that gives people something they'll always remember. We call that a star moment and it could be a piece of dramatic data where the big numbers put up there, it could be a an evocative story, it could be a beautiful picture." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>

*   **Dramatic Data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>: Using a large, impactful number on a slide.
*   **Evocative Story** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>: [[how_to_construct_effective_and_memorable_stories | Infusing stories]] that resonate deeply.
*   **Beautiful Picture** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>: Utilizing powerful imagery.

### Early Innovations in Visual Presentation
Duarte Incorporated played a role in the evolution of digital presentations, especially with Apple being a client since the company's founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Apple was the first company to connect computers to projectors at scale, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with early black-and-white graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

An early, impactful example of visual storytelling was a slide for an Apple sales conference in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The sales leader requested a slide completely covered with the word "BIG" in hot pink on a black background. This visual was intended to light up the faces of the audience, creating a memorable moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This moment highlighted how digital presentations could go beyond simple text, influencing the understanding that presentations could be done differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

Duarte also contributed to Apple's "Think Different" campaign by creating visuals that were clean and uncluttered, in contrast to the trend of busy, beveled backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This approach emphasized clarity and audience focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Visualizing Complex Information
Demonstrating concepts through pictures is highly effective for aligning understanding, especially in technical fields. Diagrams can clarify relationships: "is this thing inside of it, outside of it, attached to it, is it on it, is above it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

For complex systems or processes, visual aids ensure that the audience grasps the flow of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. In situations without formal presentations, drawing on a napkin or whiteboard can quickly align understanding among participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.

### The Power of "No Visuals"
Sometimes, the most impactful visual technique is to remove visuals entirely. For instance, in Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, his words alone painted vivid pictures in the audience's minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. Turning off slides forces the audience to focus solely on the speaker's verbal narrative, body language, and passion, creating a powerful, undistracted connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Designing Effective Slides
### One Idea Per Slide
A fundamental principle for slide design is that each slide should convey **one point** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>. The entire presentation should be grounded in a "big idea" â€” the speaker's point of view and what's at stake if the idea is adopted or rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. Each slide then supports this overarching big idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

> "People can't process too many things at one time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>

### Slide Docs
For internal meetings or information sharing via email, "slide docs" are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. These presentations contain more words and stronger pictures, functioning like a six-page memo but with visuals. They can include a lengthy appendix, allowing people to read them independently without a presenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

### Audience and Context
The density and style of slides should be tailored to the audience and their cultural communication norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>. Some audiences, especially in consulting firms, prefer denser slides that provide comprehensive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. Others may prefer cinematic, stage-ready visuals. Understanding how the audience communicates is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.

For internal team meetings where everyone shares a common shorthand, using familiar, dense slides (like tables or spreadsheets) is acceptable because it aligns the team around a shared process and objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

## Storyboarding and Process
Duarte's approach to presentation design often mirrors Pixar's movie-making process for high-stakes moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. This involves:

*   **Narrative and Big Idea Crafting**: Defining the core message and story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **Scripting**: Writing out the verbal content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.
*   **Visualizing Key Moments**: Sketching out slides and conceptual models early in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
*   **Iteration and Consensus**: Circulating models and gathering feedback to build consensus within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
*   **Refinement**: Working out "kinks" in the narrative before final delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

This process ensures that the verbal track is fully supported and impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

### The "Snow White" Example at Airbnb
The Airbnb "Snow White" project is a prime example of [[importance_of_storytelling_for_product_managers | product managers]] using visual storytelling and [[empathy_in_storytelling_and_communication | empathy]] to drive strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. To understand their customers better, Airbnb hired an illustrator to create keyframes depicting a "day in the life" of a host and a guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. This visual journey revealed critical insights, leading the company to shift to a mobile-first strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. These illustrated keyframes were displayed in the office, becoming the visual representation of the company's strategy, allowing teams to focus on improving specific "moments" in the customer journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

## Visuals in Remote Presentations
For remote presentations, Nancy Duarte advises speakers to look directly into the camera to simulate eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. This helps convey presence, as non-verbal cues like hand gestures and body space are often lost in virtual settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.

Ironically, while high-production value was once expected for video content, informal videos (e.g., someone at a whiteboard in jeans) often perform better online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. The focus has shifted from polish to raw, informative content, suggesting that message clarity trumps elaborate production in many contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>.

## Conclusion
Effective [[crafting_compelling_presentations | presentations]], whether on a grand stage or in a small meeting, leverage visual storytelling to connect with the audience. By making the audience the hero, [[techniques_to_add_stakes_and_suspense_in_storytelling | infusing story]] with contrasting ideas (what is vs. what could be, leading to "new bliss"), and ensuring the audience can "see what you're saying," speakers can create memorable and influential experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

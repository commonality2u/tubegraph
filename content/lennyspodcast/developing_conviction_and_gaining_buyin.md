Developing strong conviction in ideas and effectively gaining buy-in from colleagues, leadership, and users are crucial skills for Product Managers (PMs). Mahika Kapor, a design engineering PM hybrid at Figma, is highly regarded for her ability to [[developing_and_communicating_a_product_vision | develop a compelling vision]] and [[creating_alignment_and_buyin_within_teams | get buy-in]] for her ideas, particularly when spearheading new "0 to 1" products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Her approach emphasizes deeply understanding user needs, crafting persuasive communications, and fostering an entrepreneurial culture within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Conviction
For Mahika, conviction is paramount, enabling navigation through the "messy" and "chaotic" product development cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Strong conviction allows a PM to rally their team and maintain momentum despite challenges like user feedback leading to pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

### Developing Conviction
*   **Intuition and Curiosity**: Conviction stems from developing strong intuition, cultivated through an "insatiable curiosity" and frequent conversations with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This builds a "repository or library of conversations" to draw from when making product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **"A-minus idea" Approach**: Instead of starting from scratch, it's better to put forward an "A-minus idea" to gather feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. People are more likely to react to an existing idea, whether positively or negatively, which helps refine it into a stronger solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **"Strong Opinions, Weakly Held"**: While holding strong convictions, it's equally important to be adaptable and willing to "kill your darlings" if external signals or user feedback suggest a different direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This agility is key to navigating constant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## Crafting a Compelling Vision
A clear and compelling vision serves as an anchor for the team, ensuring that any step, even pivots, feels like "forward progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

### Key Aspects of Vision Crafting
*   **User and Team Inseparability**: A compelling vision cannot be created in a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. It requires deep connection with users and constant collaboration with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-Pollination of Functions**: Visioning should involve insights from research, beautiful designs and prototypes, and grounding in engineering feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. This collaborative approach leads to a stronger vision than a linear process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. The "Medici Effect" highlights that innovation comes from the confluence of ideas from different places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.
*   **Visual Communication**: At Figma, where the culture is detail-oriented and visual, "words will only get you so far" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. Vision pitches are most compelling when they combine pain points, solutions, and proof points (e.g., user testimonials, mockups, or prototypes) to create an emotional pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>.
    *   Even without design or engineering skills, PMs can leverage AI tools (like Cognition's Devon for coding or Figma itself for design) to lower the barrier to building prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, simply asking colleagues for help on a hackathon project can gather the necessary skills to bring an idea to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>.
*   **Unified Artifacts**: Teams should create a single, combined artifact (e.g., a deck in Figma with embedded prototypes) for their vision pitch, fostering shared ownership and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.

### Example: FigJam's Meetings Experience
Mahika's work on FigJam's meetings experience started with the insight that brainstorming was a highly democratizing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>. The vision became transforming all meetings to be as generative and democratic as brainstorms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. Features like music and voting were then launched to enhance this democratic flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>. This vision was anchored in user behavior (internal Figma use of FigJam) and user conversations about why brainstorms excelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.

## Gaining Buy-In and Building Hype
The PM is "The Keeper of the flame" for their idea, responsible for continuously creating momentum and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This applies to both internal and external audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

### Strategies for Building Hype
*   **Strategic Visibility**: Leverage large company forums (e.g., sales kickoff, hackathons like Maker Week, annual conferences like Config) to showcase products, even if they are early-stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Unexpected demos can generate significant hype and help people "see what you yourself see in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This also yields valuable early product insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Connection**: Hype is tied to emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Make users feel special and that the product was built "for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
    *   *Example: FigJam's First Birthday* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>: Instead of a typical anniversary, Figma celebrated FigJam's "birthday" by Easter-egging new features as "presents" throughout the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This created a fun, personal experience that users could participate in and get excited about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
*   **Authentic Belief**: It's difficult to create genuine hype for something you don't personally believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Passion for an idea naturally translates into the ability to generate excitement around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## Communication and Feedback for Buy-In
Direct communication is vital for fostering trust and ensuring ideas are challenged and refined effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

### Principles of Effective Communication
*   **Two-Way Directness**: Directness only works if it's reciprocal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Leaders should actively solicit feedback first to encourage open dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   **"Feedback as a Gift"**: Embrace feedback as a continuous process, not just during formal cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Acting on feedback as soon as possible incentivizes others to provide it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Explicit Confidence Levels**: When expressing opinions, explicitly state your confidence level (e.g., "medium confidence") to signal openness to discussion and avoid shutting down dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This creates a culture where everyone feels comfortable speaking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### Operationalizing User Insights
*   **Recurring Cadences**: Set up regular meetings with sales teams to understand customer pain points and share product roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
*   **Artifact Creation**: Create artifacts (e.g., Loom videos of product usage) that sales teams can use to evangelize products and their diverse use cases to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Systematized Feedback**: Implement systems (e.g., Slack integrations to capture feedback into Asana tasks) to store and groom insights that may not be immediately actionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## Fostering an Entrepreneurial Culture
For a company to stay competitive, it must remain entrepreneurial, constantly innovating and looking ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>.

### Key Elements
*   **"Run with it" Culture**: Companies like Figma encourage employees to "Sprint off in a direction," viewing initiative not as a distraction but as a manifestation of company values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>.
*   **Bottoms-Up Innovation**: Many monumental launches at Figma, such as multi-edit, Jambot (an AI plugin), and the entire widgets platform, originated from hackathons and bottoms-up projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>.
*   **The "Keeper of the Flame" Metaphor**: The person or team pushing a "0 to 1" idea acts as the "hearth keeper," responsible for stoking the flames, preventing the idea from dying out, and ensuring it spreads like wildfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.
    *   This requires having the right idea (user empathy), securing [[creating_alignment_and_buyin_within_teams | buy-in]] (vision), and making it spread (hype) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>.
*   **Early Staging and Dogfooding**: Companies like Figma have multi-month staging processes, where products are dogfooded internally early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. This vulnerability generates valuable feedback and makes internal stakeholders invested in the product's success, as they feel they "shaped that part of the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:59">[01:27:59]</a>.

## Understanding Team Motivations
Successful leadership and driving ideas forward involve understanding the motivations of individual team members and adapting to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:09">[01:30:09]</a>.

*   **Tailored Involvement**: Not everyone wants to be deeply involved in the product visioning phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:27">[01:30:27]</a>. Some prefer a handed-down solution to focus on technical implementation, while others need to contribute to feel passionate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:33">[01:30:33]</a>.
*   **Open Decision-Making**: When making decisions, even with a strong point of view, it's important to take decisions in the open and give everyone the opportunity to voice their perspective and push back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>. This leads to higher-functioning teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>.

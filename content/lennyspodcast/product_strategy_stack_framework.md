The [[product_strategy_stack_framework | Product Strategy Stack Framework]] is a system designed to help product leaders clarify and define various aspects of their product strategy, separating terms often conflated like goals, roadmaps, and strategy itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Its primary purpose is to provide a clear framework for decision-making and to drive value for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This framework can help diagnose and resolve issues such as difficulty in prioritizing features, which often stem from a lack of deep understanding of the underlying strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

The stack comprises five core components, working as a cohesive system:

## Components of the Product Strategy Stack

1.  **Company Mission** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>
    *   This is the qualitative, inspirational statement defining the change the company aims to bring to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. It articulates the company's overarching purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
    *   Vision is considered part of the mission, combining the description of the future world and the company's role within it into a single statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. The key is not to overthink its definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

2.  **Company Strategy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>
    *   Unlike the aspirational mission, the company strategy is a rigorously logical and specific plan detailing how the company will achieve its mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. It is the approach or plan for making progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

3.  **Product Strategy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>
    *   This acts as the connective tissue, linking what the company seeks to accomplish with the daily activities of the product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

4.  **Product Roadmap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>
    *   The roadmap is informed by the product strategy and outlines the features and initiatives to be developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

5.  **Product Goals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>
    *   The product goals are ultimately informed by the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. This is a contrarian viewpoint, as goals are often set at the beginning of a strategic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. The rationale is that a "goals-first" approach can misdirect a team's energy to merely hit numbers without a clear understanding of the "why" or "what success looks like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. Goals should measure progress towards a predefined destination (strategy), not *be* the destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.

## Working with the Strategy Stack

The [[product_strategy_stack_framework | Product Strategy Stack Framework]] can be used in two primary ways:

*   **Top-down:** For defining strategy, starting with the mission and flowing down to goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.
*   **Bottom-up:** For debugging strategy, by identifying issues at the goals level and tracing them up through the roadmap, product strategy, company strategy, and ultimately the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

### Importance of Visuals in Product Strategy

When defining strategy, especially product strategy, it's crucial to include visuals like wireframes. Relying solely on words for strategy documents can lead to varied interpretations among team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. Wireframes, even low-fidelity conceptual ones, provide a clear blueprint of what the product will look like when the strategy is implemented, fostering greater alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

For Product Managers (PMs) who may not have immediate access to designers, it is advisable to:
*   **Sketch ideas on paper:** Something is better than nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
*   **Learn wireframing tools:** Tools like Balsamiq allow for rapid creation of conceptual wireframes to communicate ideas clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
*   **Develop UX/UI understanding:** Understanding [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | user experience design]] is a critical skill for PMs, enabling them to think conceptually about how features translate into user interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

## Examples of the Strategy Stack in Action

### Tinder vs. Hinge

A compelling example of the [[product_strategy_stack_framework | Product Strategy Stack Framework]] in action is comparing Tinder and Hinge, both dating apps with distinct missions and strategies:

*   **Company Mission:**
    *   **Hinge:** "Designed to be deleted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a> – success is users finding a long-term relationship and leaving the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
    *   **Tinder:** "Make single life more fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a> – aims to be a continuous app on a user's phone throughout their single life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

*   **Company Strategy:**
    *   Both utilize a freemium monetization model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.
    *   Customer Acquisition:
        *   **Hinge:** Relies heavily on television advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.
        *   **Tinder:** Focuses on influencer marketing and event-based marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.

*   **Product Strategy:**
    *   **Tinder:** Original swipe-based app, built for a lightweight experience, fast swiping, easy matching, and chatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. Profiles are simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. Resisted features like extensive filters to encourage serendipitous connections and avoid becoming a "search engine for people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.
    *   **Hinge:** A "post-swipe" dating app, deliberately avoiding the swiping mechanic to encourage more time on profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. Features prompts in profiles to spark deeper conversations leading to long-term relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

*   **Product Roadmap:**
    *   Both companies made significant investments in video chat post-pandemic to enable online interaction before in-person meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

*   **Product Goals:**
    *   Both companies share a similar high-level goal of measuring success based on meaningful conversations (matches and chats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. However, the specific product mechanics to achieve these conversations differ based on their distinct strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

### Case Study: Tinder's "Whales" and Platinum Tier

At Tinder, a small percentage of users (often called "whales" in social gaming) were spending hundreds of dollars a month on a la carte purchases like Boosts and Super Likes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. Boosts make profiles appear more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>, and Super Likes increase the likelihood of a match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.

The initial hypothesis was that these were high-net-worth individuals flaunting wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. However, user research through focus groups revealed a different truth: these users had an "intense use case" (e.g., military personnel moving frequently, sales professionals in different cities, new city residents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. They were not necessarily higher net worth but valued the utility of meeting people more effectively and saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. They framed the cost of Tinder not against other subscriptions, but against the cost of traditional dating (e.g., hundreds of dollars a month on dates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.

This insight led to the creation of:
*   **Tinder Platinum:** A higher subscription tier bundling additional features and consumables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.
*   **Super Like with a Note:** A premium feature allowing users to send an initial chat message before matching, breaking a core Tinder rule, and further increasing match likelihood. This was priced significantly higher due to the understood utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

## Goals and the "Frontier of Understanding"

When setting goals, especially with OKRs, companies often struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. A common misconception is to always focus on "outcomes over outputs" without understanding the underlying risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.

It's important to identify the "frontier of understanding" – the point where the team knows what they need to do versus what they don't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. This leads to different types of risk-based goals:

1.  **Understanding Risk:** When a team doesn't know what levers move a particular metric (e.g., how to increase retention). The goal should be to *increase understanding*, not necessarily to move the metric itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>.
2.  **Dependency Risk:** The team understands the potential levers but may lack the necessary tools or resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.
3.  **Execution Risk:** The team has resources and strong hypotheses but may struggle to execute consistently (e.g., aiming to hit 20 experiments in a quarter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.
4.  **Strategic Risk:** The team has a hypothesis and executes well, but the hypothesis itself might prove incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

By understanding these risks, a team can set more realistic and impactful goals, leading to better calibration and more productive conversations with leadership, even if a direct outcome goal isn't immediately met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

## Product Leadership and Micromanagement

In [[Product Leadership and Management Techniques | product leadership]], a common challenge is avoiding micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. Two failure modes exist:
1.  **Direct Micromanagement:** Not allowing team members autonomy, leading to distrust and limited team scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.
2.  **Completely Hands-Off:** Giving autonomy without sufficient context or guardrails, leading to potential misdirection of efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.

The solution is **selective micromanagement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>. Great leaders like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk are known for their attention to detail, recognizing that "the details matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. For product leaders, growth means increasing their "dynamic range" – being able to zoom from high-level strategy to tactical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.

The ideal is **scalable leadership**, where the leader is confident in the team's direction, and the team has autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. If confidence is low, selective micromanagement is appropriate: temporarily take away some autonomy to guide the team in the right direction, with the ultimate goal of returning to a scalable leadership mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>. This approach focuses on teaching frameworks so the team can eventually make aligned decisions independently, leading to solutions even better than the leader could have devised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>.

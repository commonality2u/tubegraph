The Product Strategy Stack is a framework designed to clearly define and separate common product terms like goals, roadmap, and strategy, which are often conflated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This system helps teams understand the framework for making decisions and driving business value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

The concept was initially developed at TripAdvisor to help define strategy for new features like trip planning, ensuring a top-down approach to align incremental steps with overall goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Components of the Product Strategy Stack

The stack consists of five interconnected layers, working as a system:

1.  **Company Mission**: This is the qualitative, inspirational statement of the change the company aims to bring to the world, defining its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Vision is considered part of the mission, describing the future world and the company's role in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
2.  **Company Strategy**: While the mission is aspirational, the strategy is rigorously logical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. It's the specific, rigorous plan the company will use to achieve its mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
3.  **Product Strategy**: This serves as the connective tissue between the company's objectives and the day-to-day activities of the product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
4.  **Product Roadmap**: The product roadmap is informed by the [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | product strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
5.  **Product Goals**: These are derived from the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. A key contrarian view in this framework is placing goals *after* the roadmap. This is because a "goals-first" approach can lead to optimizing for metrics without understanding the underlying strategy or destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Goals should confirm progress towards a defined destination, not define the direction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

This system allows for both top-down definition of strategy and bottom-up debugging. If goals are not being met, it might be due to issues in the roadmap, which could stem from an unclear [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | product strategy]], a lack of understanding of the company's strategy, or even the overarching company mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Applying the Framework

### Importance of Visuals in Strategy
When defining strategy, especially for products with visual interfaces, including wireframes or mock-ups is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Describing strategy in words alone often leads to different interpretations among team members, but visual representations create clearer alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Product managers are encouraged to develop [[role_of_fullstack_skills_in_modern_product_management | design skills]] and use tools like Balsamiq or simply sketch ideas to visualize their product vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Tinder vs. Hinge
An illustrative example of the strategy stack in action is comparing Tinder and Hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>:

| Layer                 | Hinge (Example)                                        | Tinder (Example)                                           |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Company Mission**   | "Designed to be deleted" – aiming for long-term relationships that lead to app uninstallation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. | "Make single life more fun" – aiming to be a continuous app for single people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. |
| **Company Strategy**  | Relies heavily on television ads for customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. | Relies on influencer and event-based marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Both use a freemium monetization model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. |
| **Product Strategy**  | Post-swipe model; encourages spending more time on profiles with prompts to spark deeper conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. | Original swipe-based app; built for lightweight, fast matching and chatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Resisted comprehensive filters to encourage serendipitous connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. |
| **Product Roadmap**   | Both invested in video chat post-pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Specific features differ based on product strategy (e.g., Hinge profiles with prompts, Tinder's Platinum tier with "Super Likes with a note" to break the no-chat-before-match rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. |
| **Product Goals**     | Both measure success based on meaningful conversations, but the specific product mechanics to achieve them differ based on their strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. |

This example demonstrates how different missions and strategies lead to distinct product approaches, even for similar underlying use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## Goal Setting and the "Frontier of Understanding"

When setting goals, especially with frameworks like OKRs, it's easy to fall into the trap of always focusing on outcomes over outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. While driving outcomes is the ultimate goal, it's crucial to understand the "Frontier of Understanding" – the point where a team knows what it needs to know and what it doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

Instead of committing to an outcome, goals should align with the current type of risk:
1.  **Understanding Risk**: If the team doesn't know what moves a particular metric, the goal should be to increase understanding, not just move the metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
2.  **Dependency Risk**: If levers are understood but tools or resources are lacking, the goal might be to acquire necessary tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
3.  **Execution Risk**: If resources and hypotheses are strong, the goal can be focused on flawless execution, e.g., hitting a target number of experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
4.  **Strategic Risk**: This is the ultimate outcome-focused goal, where the hypothesis is tested to see if it aligns with the overall strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

Teams should focus on both hitting goals and understanding *why* they succeeded or failed. If a goal is missed, knowing *why* allows for clear communication to leadership about the "Frontier of Understanding" and a more confident path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## Product Leadership and Selective Micromanagement
Effective product leaders balance scalable leadership with the ability to "selectively micromanage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   **Scalable Leadership** is the ideal, where the leader is confident in the team's direction and the team has autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Selective Micromanagement** is appropriate when confidence in the team's direction is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. This involves temporary, tactical intervention to guide the team to the right direction, with the goal of pulling back once alignment is restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

This approach acknowledges that details matter for product builders and innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>, and leaders should increase their "dynamic range" – being able to zoom from high-level strategy to specific tactical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. The ultimate success is when the team, guided by a clear framework, produces solutions even better than the leader could have conceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>.

The [[Delta 4 framework and metrics for software delivery | Delta 4 framework]], developed by Kunal Shah, CEO and founder of Cred, provides a measurable way to assess product efficiency and predict success, moving beyond the often abstract concept of a product needing to be "10x better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Shah, who has a background in philosophy, embarked on a philosophical quest to understand what makes products successful, especially after his first startup, FreeCharge, achieved significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Core Concept
The framework posits that a product is considered to have a "Delta 4" advantage if its efficiency score is at least four points higher than the existing solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This is determined by rating the efficiency of the old solution and the new solution on a scale of 1 to 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Characteristics of a Delta 4 Product (Delta >= 4)
When a product's efficiency Delta is greater than or equal to four, three key things occur:
*   **Irreversible** The shift to the new product becomes irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **High Tolerance for Failure** Users develop a high tolerance for the product to fail slightly without abandoning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Unique Brag-Worthy Proposition (UBP)** Users cannot stop talking about or sharing their experience with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This often results in lower or even zero customer service (CS) needs because people promote it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Products like these are typically discovered through word-of-mouth rather than traditional advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Characteristics of a Non-Delta 4 Product (Delta < 4)
Conversely, when the efficiency Delta is less than four:
*   **Reversible** The user can easily revert to the old solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Zero Tolerance for Failure** Users have no tolerance for the product to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **No Bragging** People will not brag about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## Examples

### Uber vs. Old Cab
*   **Old Cab Efficiency**: Around 3 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Uber Efficiency**: Around 9 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Delta**: 6, which is >= 4. This makes Uber an irreversible service that users tolerate minor failures from and actively talk about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Buying a Suit Online vs. Offline
*   **Online Suit Purchase Efficiency**: If the suit doesn't fit, the overall efficiency score might be low, potentially 5 out of 10 or worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Offline Suit Purchase Efficiency**: Potentially higher, perhaps 9 out of 10 for a good experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Delta**: The online experience has a Delta less than 4, making it reversible, non-bragworthy, and with zero tolerance for failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

### Generative AI
*   **OpenAI and LLMs**: Products built with this technology feel like magic and demonstrate a Delta 4 efficiency, significantly improving tasks compared to before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The main challenge here is ensuring reliability and addressing potential failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### "Better Excel" Products
*   Many products that claim to be "better Excel" may feel superior but fail to achieve a Delta 4 status because users might rate existing solutions (like Excel) as high, making the new product's efficiency gain insufficient to compel a switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. People are busy and won't switch for minor improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

## Application and Underlying Concepts
The [[Delta 4 framework and metrics for software delivery | Delta 4 framework]] can be applied to evaluate individual features, entire products, or even broader business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. It is rooted in studies around entropy and evolutionary biology, exploring when a species (or product) gets disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

The framework is simple yet powerful, with some Venture Capital firms in the US reportedly using it as part of their analyst training programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Jeff Weinstein, former product lead at Stripe, emphasizes that building successful and beloved products stems from an obsession with [[building_and_evolving_a_software_product | product quality]] and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a>. His approach prioritizes deeply understanding customer problems and systematically improving the product.

## The "Go Go Go + Optimism, Long-Term Compounding" Philosophy

Weinstein advocates for a "go go go plus optimism, long-term compounding" approach to [[building_and_evolving_a_software_product | product development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.

*   **Go Go Go:** This involves immediately taking action and injecting energy, aiming to get things done as soon as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. It's about moving forward, making mistakes, and trying things out quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Compounding:** This aspect involves a strategic mindset for problems that cannot be solved quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. It means investing in foundational elements that will always be valuable, like making API latency faster or improving reliability, which compounds over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Weinstein highlights the challenge of [[balancing_speed_and_quality_in_product_development | balancing speed and quality in product development]] between these two philosophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. For example, at Stripe, expanding global payment methods initially saw flat progress despite intense "go go go" energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. It required a shift to a slower, more strategic approach of building internal platforms and immersing teams in local payment methods worldwide, leading to exponential growth from 10 to over 100 payment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

## Obsession with Craft and Quality

Weinstein's focus on craft and quality stems from past failures where products didn't solve a burning problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. He views craft as a "dessert that you get after the meal" of solving a real problem that people desperately need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. No amount of beauty or delight can fix a product if it doesn't address a fundamental need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

### Prioritizing Burning Problems
The primary obsession should be finding problems that compel people to "pause their entire day to solve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. This means focusing on the "first problem" that makes people "get out of bed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

## [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development | Talking to Customers]] and User Research

Weinstein employs a unique, direct approach to [[integrating_user_research_effectively_into_product_development | integrating user research effectively into product development]] and [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development | talking to customers]]:

*   **Break the Wall:** He actively shares his email and is constantly on calls, directly interacting with customers rather than solely relying on user research teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
*   **Speed:** Respond to customer feedback immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. A customer taking time to communicate a problem is an "unbelievable gift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.
*   **Silence:** Avoid pitching the product; instead, sit in silence and wait for customers to reveal their "most burning thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. This allows the product roadmap to emerge organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
    *   **Prompts for Silence:** Ask open-ended questions like: "What would you be working on if you weren't talking to me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>, "What grinded your gears last week?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, or "What do you wish you could just have off your plate immediately?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
*   **Turning Detractors into Promoters:** When errors occur, quickly engage to not just solve the problem but turn the unhappy customer into a promoter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
*   **Selective Engagement:** While welcoming all feedback, prioritize deeper engagement with the "most ambitious, most technical, fastest growing, most detailed" customers, as five to ten such relationships can provide immense direct signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   **Focus on Paying Customers:** Only pay attention to feedback from paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. Friends or non-target users often provide feedback that does not reflect actual need. The willingness to exchange money for a solution is the ultimate signal of a burning problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.
    *   **Forcing Function:** Ask potential customers to "practice paying" by sending a symbolic invoice to solidify their commitment and reveal true value drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>.
*   **"Bugfinder" Programs:** Create informal programs (e.g., "bugfinder program" over three days) to solicit specific feedback, such as Loom videos of bugs. This gives customers permission and structure to engage, providing valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

## Picking Metrics for Product Success

Metrics should represent the value provided to the customer, measured from *their* perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

*   **Product-Market Fit:** [[improving_product_management_skills | Product managers]] are responsible for producing product-market fit, which is evident through "charts that showcase things are going up and to the right" (quantitative) and customer tweets (qualitative) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Both are deeply important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.
*   **Guiding Trade-offs:** Metrics force difficult trade-offs and help align large groups toward a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.
*   **Stripe Atlas Example: "Companies with Zero Support Tickets"**
    *   When Jeff joined Stripe Atlas, support tickets indicated unhappy customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.
    *   The team chose a core metric: "companies that have no support tickets" from application start to two weeks post-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. This differs from an average and directly correlates to customer recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.
    *   By focusing on reducing support tickets (e.g., automating 83(b) elections, simplifying share purchases), the metric rose from 15% to 85% in 18 months, mirroring Atlas's market share growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.
    *   This metric was "incredibly encouraging and motivating" for engineers, who were empowered to solve issues directly by replying to support tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>.
*   **"Users Having a Bad Day" Metric:**
    *   This universal metric involves emitting a log line whenever a user encounters a problem (e.g., 404 error, delayed payout, payment declines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>.
    *   A stacked bar chart visualizing these "bad day" reasons can be eye-opening and provides a consistent way to track and prioritize pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. This serves as a background noise counting system for problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>.
*   **Metric Hygiene:**
    *   **Meaningful Titles:** Give metrics titles that are simple, focused, and reflect a customer mindset (e.g., "companies with zero support tickets") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. This makes them motivating and easy to rally around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
    *   **Clarity & Consistency:** Maintain good hygiene in dashboards (e.g., significant digits, consistent x-axis) to encourage frequent engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
    *   **Single Source of Truth:** Insist on a single, discoverable "go-metrics" dashboard to build trust in data accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.

## "Study Groups" for Empathy and Quality Improvement

To combat "product rot" and reinforce [[quality_improvement_leading_to_business_impact | quality improvement]], Weinstein introduced "study groups" at Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

*   **Concept:** A random group of 4-8 employees (not necessarily PMs) pretends to be a company with a specific problem (e.g., selling tickets at a farmers market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:52]</a>.
*   **Rules:**
    1.  **"You do not work at Stripe":** Participants must not use any internal Stripe knowledge or lingo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>. This forces genuine empathy for the customer's experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>.
    2.  **"We're not here to solve any problems":** The focus is purely on experiencing the product as a customer, not critiquing or filing bugs during the session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Deeply eye-opening for participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.
    *   Highly motivating for internal teams to address issues once they see colleagues struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>.
    *   Generates high-signal qualitative data that feeds into existing bug processes without creating new mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>.
    *   Fun and engaging, encouraging participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>.
*   **Impact:** Over 25 study groups with 250+ participants in a few months, demonstrating how deeply embedding empathy can lead to [[improving_developer_experience | improving developer experience]] and product insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## [[quality_improvement_leading_to_business_impact | Quality Improvement Leading to Business Impact]]

Weinstein argues that product quality directly translates to business value. If someone has a strategy for moving revenue without making a great product experience, he wants to know about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>.

*   **Product is the Entire Experience:** The "product" extends beyond software to include sales processes, support interactions, compliance tools, and even physical mail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:16">[01:29:16]</a>.
*   **Customer Acquisition:** A fantastic product experience can be the best customer acquisition strategy, especially for businesses like Stripe Atlas where customers tell their friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.
*   **GDP Growth:** By simplifying complex processes like company incorporation (Stripe Atlas), friction is removed, allowing businesses to start generating revenue sooner and potentially contributing to economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:35">[01:47:35]</a>.

## General Principles for [[building_and_evolving_a_software_product | Building and Evolving a Software Product]] at a Large Company

*   **Customer-Driven Strategy:** Let customer problems drive the strategy, rather than personal ideas. Present customer quotes and stories to align the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:10">[02:04:10]</a>.
*   **Sharpie Vision:** Storyboard the "unconstrained perfect solution" visually with a Sharpie, focusing on the ideal user flow rather than initial design fidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:02">[02:05:02]</a>.
*   **Tangible Progress & Momentum:** Achieve "proof of existence" by getting one thing working quickly. This creates momentum, builds trust, and makes it easier to take on bigger bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:29">[02:06:29]</a>.
*   **Transparency:** Use shared metrics dashboards that everyone can access and see success, reducing the need for lengthy internal updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:34">[02:07:34]</a>.
*   **Economic Viability:** Clearly communicate and measure why a product is economically viable, whether it's for customer acquisition, margin generation, or ecosystem growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:22">[02:09:22]</a>.
*   **Customer Co-Design:** Involve customers in the design process directly, allowing them to visualize and build what they want, rather than guessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:11">[02:17:11]</a>.
*   **"You can't screw up a sentence if it begins with the customer."** – Jeff's father's motto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:59">[02:18:59]</a>. By physically placing the customer at the center of discussions, internal bias can be counteracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:32">[02:19:32]</a>.

Weinstein's lessons emphasize that a relentless, empathetic focus on solving customer problems, backed by clear metrics and a culture of continuous improvement, is fundamental to driving both product quality and business growth.

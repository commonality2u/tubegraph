From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Salesforce, co-founded and led by CEO Marc Benioff, launched with a distinctive and aggressive marketing strategy that aimed to disrupt the traditional software industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The company, now the second-largest B2B SaaS company globally, focused on convincing customers that the future of software was in the cloud, not on the desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## The Legendary Launch Event: "The End of Software"

Salesforce's launch in February 2000 was designed to be memorable and provocative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. A key tactic involved directly challenging established enterprise software companies, particularly Siebel Systems, which was a dominant CRM provider at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

### Guerrilla Marketing Tactics

To gain attention and differentiate itself, Salesforce employed unconventional marketing stunts:
*   **"No Software" Logos and Mascots** The company used "end of software" logos and mascots to convey its cloud-first message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **Fake Protesters at Siebel Conference** Salesforce hired actors to stage a protest outside Siebel's user conference in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. The actors carried picket signs with slogans like "The End Software Is Near" and "No Software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. The aim was to highlight that Salesforce was advocating for "the end of software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Staged News Coverage** During the protest, additional actors arrived in a van, posing as a news crew (dubbed "KNMS - No More Software") to interview the "protesters," creating the illusion of a media event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This tactic successfully upset Siebel's CEO, Tom Siebel, who even called the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **Launch Event Party** On the same night as the protest, Salesforce held a large launch event at a top San Francisco theater, featuring a live band and a celebratory atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

## Breaking Through the Noise: A Strategic Approach to Marketing

Benioff emphasizes the challenge of gaining attention in a "noisy world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. His approach, both at launch and for new product introductions like Agent Force, is to "throw everything against the wall and look at what's going to stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. The goal is to identify a "winning tactic" and then scale it into a "winning strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

### Modern Marketing and Sales Efforts for Agent Force
For the launch of Agent Force, a new AI product, Benioff is employing a multi-pronged approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>:
*   **Dedicated Conference Focus** Reworking Dreamforce, Salesforce's annual conference, to focus entirely on Agent Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   **Celebrity Endorsements** Engaging friends Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson to create advertisements, testing these ads on social media for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Showcasing Internal Use** Highlighting how Agent Force has reduced human escalation in Salesforce's own support by 50% and resolves 83% of inquiries robotically, demonstrating its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   **Sales Enablement** Training all salespeople on how to sell Agent Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Competitive Marketing** Directly marketing and positioning against competitors like Microsoft's Co-Pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   **Expanding Distribution** Planning to hire an additional 1,000 to 2,000 account executives specifically for Agent Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[building_a_sales_team_in_b2b_saas | direct sales]] in Salesforce's strategy.
*   **Customer Stories and Adoption** Sharing customer success stories, such as Disney's use of Agent Force, and motivating existing 135,000 customers to activate the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.
*   **Community Engagement** Encouraging the millions of Salesforce Trailblazers to become "Agent Blazers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

## Marketing and Sales Interplay
Benioff dismisses the notion that Salesforce is solely "sales-led," asserting that a successful company must operate like an "orchestra leader," coordinating all functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. He believes entrepreneurs must embrace all aspects of business—product, sales, marketing, accounting, investor relations, employee and stakeholder management—rather than narrowly focusing on one area like product or sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>. This perspective highlights the comprehensive [[role_of_marketing_in_product_success | role of marketing]] as part of a broader, integrated strategy for growth.

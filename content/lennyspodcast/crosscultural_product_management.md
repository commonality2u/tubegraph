Bengali spent time working at Facebook, Instagram, Instacart, and YouTube, where he made a significant [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] across various company cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His experience highlights the importance of understanding and adapting to different cultural contexts within product management.

## Understanding Diverse Cultural Contexts
A key lesson from Bengali's career is the importance of understanding cultural nuances, especially when building products meant for a global audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:56">[01:39:56]</a>. His background in education, including teaching in inner-city D.C. and at a boarding school in Switzerland, shaped his approach to product management by emphasizing the universality of human problems and the value of diverse voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:17">[01:39:17]</a>.

To build a "world-class product" that can scale globally and achieve hyper-growth, it is essential to be inclusive of many voices and cultivate the skill to acknowledge, learn from, and live with different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:16">[01:40:16]</a>.

## Case Study: Facebook's People Recommendations in India
When Bengali was an early growth PM at Facebook, responsible for global people recommendations, he observed that Facebook's functionality for making friends seemed "broken" in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>. Data showed that users in India had significantly fewer friends in common (around seven) compared to U.S. users (around 22), and there was a high rate of friending and unfriending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:20">[01:26:20]</a>.

To address this, Bengali proposed an "understand work" initiative, which involved taking a team of engineers to India every three months to observe how people made friends and used "people you may know" in their homes in Delhi and Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. This direct observation revealed a significant cultural disconnect:
*   **Irrelevant Profile Information**: Users found standard Western-centric profile fields (like school, job title, affiliations) irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>. For example, some friends might sell jeans at a market, and school names might be numbers, making these descriptors unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.
*   **Common Names**: Names like "Amit Kumar" were extremely common (e.g., 250,000 monthly users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:49">[01:28:49]</a>, making it difficult to identify specific friends without more context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:03">[01:29:03]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Photos**: Users would go directly to profile pictures, looking for familiar cars or animals, as the main profile page provided no relevant identifying information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>.

This [[understand_work_in_product_management | understand work]] highlighted that the "cultural context was so different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:29:06]</a>, necessitating creative solutions to adapt the product for effective use in that region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>.

## Impact of Company Culture on Product Development
The [[impact_of_company_culture_on_product_development | company culture]] plays a crucial role in product success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Bengali emphasizes that a supportive and inclusive culture where individuals feel they can perform their best work is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

When joining a new team or company, it's essential to understand the existing culture and its alignment with product goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. For instance, at Instacart, Bengali realized the company's DNA was strong in operations but needed a more "tactical, in the weeds" approach to product development, whereas his vision was more strategic, focusing on building systems and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. This misalignment in cultural needs presented a significant [[challenges_in_product_management | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a>. This experience taught him the importance of gathering insights from both current and former employees to get a complete picture of a company's culture before joining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:26">[01:31:26]</a>.

## Conclusion
Bengali's career underscores that [[product_management_in_large_tech_companies | product management in large tech companies]] and fast-growing environments requires a deep understanding of diverse user behaviors and cultural contexts. By employing strategies like "understand work" and actively fostering an inclusive culture, product leaders can drive significant [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] and build products that resonate globally.

Effective research partnerships are crucial for product development, moving beyond mere "user-centered performance" to truly impactful, business-oriented insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The user research field is currently undergoing a "reckoning," prompting a need for adaptation and change in how companies leverage user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## User-Centered Performance: A Common Challenge
[[challenges_in_ux_research_and_its_evolving_role | User-centered performance]] is a phenomenon where customer obsession or user-centered practice is symbolic rather than genuinely focused on learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. It's often work done to signal commitment to users, not to genuinely inform or change decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This is "extremely common" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

Examples of user-centered performance include:
*   Product Managers (PMs) asking researchers to run a quick user study at the end of a product process "just to validate our assumptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. This is often "too late to matter" as the goal is merely to "check the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   The desire to "validate" rather than "falsify" assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Many PMs and designers "do not want to be wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Executive listening sessions, which are often "97% performance" and not genuinely focused on learning or driving better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

This phenomenon stems from cognitive biases like confirmation bias and ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. Product people and designers can also be guilty of this performative user-centeredness, often relying on intuition over evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

## The Three Levels of Research
User research can be categorized into three levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>:

1.  **Macro Research:** Big-picture, strategic, business-focused, forward-looking, and innovation-driven. This includes market analysis, competitor review, long-term product vision, and strategic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. It should be tied to annual planning processes, like "concept car projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.
2.  **Middle-Range Research:** This is a "blob place" where research questions are of "middle altitude" and focus on general user understanding (e.g., how users think, feel, or behave with a product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This type of research is often "interesting but not impactful enough for the business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, and tends to be slow, leading to delays and PMs relying on research to avoid making decisions independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
3.  **Micro Research:** Highly technical and focused on usability. This includes enabling pixel-perfect products, understanding A/B test results, and quickly identifying specific pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. It can be "so fast" and drive "so much business value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. A quick example is changing seven characters on a button CTA on Airbnb, which generated millions of dollars by addressing user fear of initiating a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

The core issue is that too much middle-range research is being done, which is often interesting but not sufficiently impactful for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Qualities of Great Researchers for Effective Partnerships
Great researchers possess a "Swiss army knife" of skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>:
1.  **Formative/Generative User Experience Research:** Forward-looking, innovation-focused, open-ended, and ethnographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
2.  **Evaluative Research (Usability Testing):** Focused on evaluating products and ensuring high-quality user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This is not "scut work" for junior researchers but can significantly improve business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
3.  **Rigorous Survey Design:** The best scaled way to get responses from communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
4.  **Applied Statistics:** Essential for understanding A/B test results and other data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
5.  **Technical Skills:** Historically SQL for running queries, now potentially prompt engineering for interacting with generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

Beyond skills, researchers need to be:
*   **Business-oriented:** Understand business goals, read quarterly reports, listen to shareholder calls, know company OKRs, metrics, and conversion funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This allows them to frame research questions that drive maximum business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   **Influential Communicators:** Able to break down complex problems simply and tailor explanations to different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.

## Qualities of Product Managers for Effective Partnerships
PMs should:
*   **Integrate research early and consistently:** This helps structure product development in a way that fully leverages research for maximum impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.
*   **Avoid treating research as a "service function"**: Calling research in only at the end leads to reactive, less impactful work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Be willing to "falsify" rather than "validate":** Embrace being wrong and seek research that exposes flaws and blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
*   **Partner on ruthless prioritization:** Help researchers focus on the most important projects, as a researcher's full plate is typically two big projects and one small one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
*   **Engage with customers directly with researchers:** Go into the field or observe research sessions. Seeing customer behavior firsthand, even for a single user (N of 1), can "blow minds" and significantly shift perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>.
*   **Be wary of relying solely on "dogfooding":** While dogfooding your own product is important, PMs are "nothing like the user" and can be biased, leading to misprioritization of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.

## Common Tropes/Misconceptions that Hinder Partnerships
*   **"Research just slows us down" or "Research is too slow":** Good research, particularly micro research, can be very fast, yielding results in 48 hours or overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. Getting it wrong and having to fix it is slower than doing the work to get it right the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
*   **"I can do my own research; why do I need researchers?":** Anyone can talk to a user, but that doesn't constitute research or insights work. Researchers are skilled at discerning idiosyncratic feedback from genuine insights and avoiding bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **"A/B test everything":** A/B tests tell you *what* changed, but rarely *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Researchers can provide the "how and why" to develop better products and avoid future mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   **The Henry Ford quote ("If I'd asked my users, they would have said faster horses"):** This apocryphal quote infuriates researchers because asking customers "what they want" is "bad research." Researchers aim to uncover underlying needs, not just stated desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.
*   **"We knew this already; that was obvious" (Post-Hoc Bias):** This comes from "hindsight bias" and the "narrative fallacy," where people selectively remember and construct narratives to feel they already knew something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. Researchers help expand horizons and continuously improve intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

## Reforming Research Partnerships
To move past the current "reckoning" and foster more impactful research partnerships, both researchers and companies need to adapt:

### For Researchers
*   **Develop diverse research skills:** Master the five key tools (formative, evaluative, survey design, applied statistics, technical skills) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
*   **Go deep on business knowledge:** Understand product and business language, metrics, and how insights can be used strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>.
*   **Build strong relationships:** This requires engagement from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.
*   **Learn to say no and focus:** Prioritize fewer, more impactful projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>.
*   **Become excellent communicators:** Present research effectively and tailor communication to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.

### For Companies
*   **Integrate research disciplines:** Avoid siloing different insights functions (e.g., UX research, consumer insights, market research, data science). Instead, create an "integrated insights function" where all feedback fuels one machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.
*   **Embed researchers in a unified, lean process:** Ensure researchers are "arm in arm" with product, design, and engineering teams from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>. This prevents research from becoming a service function and maximizes value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>.
*   **Prioritize relationships over ratios for headcount:** The right number of researchers is when everyone who needs a constant research partner has one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>. Creating "the pain of loss" for teams without a dedicated researcher can drive headcount growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.
*   **Embrace research at all stages:** Even early-stage startups can benefit greatly from a researcher, as they help companies "go faster not slower" and make evidence-based decisions, especially during critical pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

The future of research is bright, but it requires both researchers owning their growth and companies building more inclusive models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.

Startups often prioritize speed and agility to gain a competitive edge and achieve rapid growth. [[ramps_velocitydriven_approach_to_product_development | Ramp]], a leading finance automation platform, exemplifies a company that has successfully operationalized a velocity-driven approach to product development, achieving over $100 million in annual run rate in just two years with a lean team of fewer than 50 people in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Core Principles of Velocity-Driven Development

A culture of velocity is paramount at [[ramps_velocitydriven_approach_to_product_development | Ramp]], influencing everything from product development processes to hiring, promotions, decision-making, and organizational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This approach stemmed from having a small team facing a significant market opportunity during the pandemic, where execution speed was prioritized over selecting a single path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

Key benefits of high velocity include:
*   **Faster Impact** Teams with high velocity can achieve impact more quickly through rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Talent Attraction** It attracts top talent who are drawn to companies that build and ship quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **De-risking Decisions** Low-cost decisions allow for simplification and faster decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

Examples of [[ramps_velocitydriven_approach_to_product_development | Ramp]]'s rapid execution:
*   Within three months of joining, a team of eight engineers built a competitor to MX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   Six months later, they built a competitor to Expensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   A team of three engineers, one designer, and one PM built a competitor to Bill.com for accounts payable in three months, which now processes billions of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Strategies for High Velocity

### Small, Single-Threaded Teams
The "recipe" for velocity at [[ramps_velocitydriven_approach_to_product_development | Ramp]] centers on small, single-threaded teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Focused Goals** Individual contributors should have only one primary goal they focus on daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Eliminate Distractions** Remove any other tasks, research, production engineering, or processes unrelated to that single goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Shielding Teams** Implement protective layers, such as rotational production engineering programs and product operators, to shield core teams from escalations, bugs, issues, documentation, release management, and customer requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **New Product Focus** For big bets, sub-teams are reorganized from different existing teams and typically do not hold responsibility for any existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Lofty Goals and Motivation
Setting ambitious, "lofty goals" is a key driver for velocity.
*   **Market Comparables** Use publicly traded competitors (e.g., Bill.com, Expensify) as motivating benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This also helps de-risk business decisions in existing markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Design Vision** Designers craft visionary prototypes and "Loom walkthroughs" to illustrate future product possibilities, providing significant motivation for teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
*   **Revenue-Driven** Being a revenue-driven company with clear revenue goals keeps teams anchored and motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### Empowerment and Context Over Control
[[ramps_velocitydriven_approach_to_product_development | Ramp]] operates on a principle of "context over control," empowering product teams extensively.
*   **Alignment on Goals** Leaders align teams on the ultimate goals, underlying hypotheses, supporting data, and potential solutions, rather than micromanaging specific solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Debate Upstream** Discussions should focus on the interpretation of data, hypotheses, and goals, not just solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Context Sharing** Leaders provide missing context from higher-level meetings and forums to enable teams to make better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Team Autonomy** The contract between leadership and teams is their strategy and roadmap; the team's role is to highlight risks and one-way decisions requiring input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Teams publish their goals weekly, and one-on-ones focus on what the team needs from the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Distributed PM Functions** The PM job is distributed across the team. Designers are empowered to think about specs and priorities, and engineers are encouraged to deep-dive into lightweight specs, ask questions, and take ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. Engineers are accountable for the projects they drive, defining their own tickets and work breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

### Quality Control Mechanisms
Despite the focus on velocity, [[balancing_speed_and_quality_in_product_development | quality goes up with product velocity]] because issues can be fixed quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. Control mechanisms ensure high velocity doesn't compromise the business:
*   **Voice of Customer** Every negative customer review is shared monthly with the relevant tech lead, PM, and designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Metrics Reporting** NPS, CSAT, and operational overhead (percentage of support tickets from a product area normalized by user count) are regularly reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   **Bug Management** There is no bug backlog; bugs are fixed almost immediately when surfaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. Engineers on call are directly assigned to fix bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **User Confusion** If support tickets due to user confusion are elevated, teams are restricted from shipping new features until these issues are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

### Minimal Planning, Maximum Doing
The philosophy at [[ramps_velocitydriven_approach_to_product_development | Ramp]] is "any second you spend planning is a second you don't spend doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.
*   **Embrace Chaos** New joiners are explicitly told that the velocity-first approach means some chaos, occasional product changes without full enablement, and constant adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>. This chaos is a byproduct of hyper-growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.
*   **Strategic Planning** Planning is focused primarily on large market moments requiring coordination across product, marketing, and sales (e.g., once a quarter or every six months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.
*   **Autonomy in Pods** Individual pods are largely autonomous and can operate chaotically internally, provided they are accurate on things that truly matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.
*   **Consistent Vision** While specifics and timelines change, the core vision, value, and problem remain consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. Most products built remain in customers' hands, indicating effective delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>.

### Organizational Structure and Mindset
*   **Product Operations** Investment in a product operations team handles project management, issue management, release management, enablement, content, and customer research, freeing up PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.
*   **No Ticket Writing** PMs do not write tickets; their contract is the vision, priority, and a high-level spec, pushing other responsibilities to engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.
*   **Team Building** PMs focus on building strong team cultures within their pods, organizing off-sites, ideation sessions, and fostering fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.
*   **Protecting the Team** PMs serve as the central point of contact for external stakeholders, protecting the core team from demands for updates or opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

## Thinking from First Principles

[[ramps_velocity_driven_approach_to_product_development | Ramp]] emphasizes [[strategies_for_setting_and_deploying_effective_product_strategies | thinking from first principles]], especially given its unique combination of credit card, payments, and software business models, serving both SMBs and enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.
*   **Beyond Pattern Matching** This means not relying solely on past experience but returning to the fundamental nature of the problem and thinking through it deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.
*   **Hiring Mindset** Hire people who can think from first principles and set aside past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Influence comes from deep thinking, not from past company examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.
*   **Support Team Example** [[ramps_velocity_driven_approach_to_product_development | Ramp]]'s support team reports directly to product leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. The first principle was: "every support ticket is a failure of our product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This led to incentivizing support to decrease ticket volume rather than just resolve them, requiring a different type of hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. The outcome is an extremely low contact rate despite hundreds of thousands of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.

## Preventing Burnout
The debate around hard work and [[balancing_speed_and_quality_in_product_development | burnout]] often misses the point of impact and job satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.
*   **Velocity as Burnout Prevention** Burnout often occurs when effort doesn't lead to progress. High velocity, by ensuring effort translates to impact, can actually help avoid burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
*   **Focus on Impact** The goal is to focus on "building great products for our customers" and enabling a "flow state" where work feels thrilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **Meaningful Work** Burnout is avoided when individuals are proud of their work and find it meaningful to *them*, not just to their superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. Management's role is to make every team member feel ownership over their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.

## Optimizing Productivity and Organization

### Writing as a Tool for Thought
Writing is crucial for [[strategies_for_setting_and_deploying_effective_product_strategies | clarifying thought]] and solving problems.
*   **First Principles Thinking** When faced with a complex problem, shut down the laptop, take out paper, write the question simply, and dedicate time to thinking through the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Clarity of Thought** Clear writing indicates clear thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.
*   **Effective Communication** Writing was also essential for effective communication during the remote work period of COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Thinking** Block out time for deep work, especially during off-peak hours like early mornings, late afternoons, or weekends, to engage in philosophical thought rather than constant meetings or Googling answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.

### Task Management and Headspace
*   **Robust System** Maintain a simple yet robust task management system. At the end of every meeting, clearly write down tasks owed by oneself and others, along with deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.
*   **Daily Grooming** At the end of the day, group tasks into logical chunks (tactical vs. strategic, important vs. less important) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.
*   **Free Up Memory** Focus on freeing up "headspace for processing, not memory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. Write everything down and rely on searchable systems (e.g., Google Workspace) to quickly retrieve information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.
*   **Optimize Tools** Turn off notifications, check emails only once a day for short periods, and check Slack only at the top of the hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>. Train teams on how to effectively use their tools (e.g., calendar, Slack, email) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.

## Talent and Hiring
A major factor in [[ramps_velocity_driven_approach_to_product_development | Ramp]]'s success is the high quality of its engineering and design talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
*   **Investment in R&D** Ensure top-down investment in R&D as a first-class citizen, paying top market rates to hire the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.
*   **CEO Trust** The CEO should set the vision but trust the empowered tech organization with the specifics of execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **Hiring for Impact and Deep Thinking** When interviewing, prioritize candidates with a strong desire for impact and the ability to think deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. Probe past decisions and trade-offs to assess their depth of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.
*   **Attracting Top Talent** Engineers who want to win in the market, understand business context, are curious about customers, and proactively solve problems are highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>.
*   **Breaking into Product Management** For those aspiring to product management, find roles adjacent to product (e.g., product operations, business operations, sales engineering, design, engineering) that provide deep customer and product understanding, then prove impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.

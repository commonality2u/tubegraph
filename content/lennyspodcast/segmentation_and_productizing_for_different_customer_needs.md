When discussing pricing, many often gravitate directly to dollar figures, which only represents a price point. However, price should be seen as a measure of value, akin to how a liter measures volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This perspective highlights whether people truly want and would buy a product, leading to the "willingness to pay" conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Businesses need to understand this early to ensure they are on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Importance of Value-Based Segmentation

Segmentation is a widely understood term in product development, often linked to the concept of [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_a_b2b_company | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. However, the issue arises because it's not just about [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_a_b2b_company | product-market fit]]; it's about achieving a product-market-pricing fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Often, companies misunderstand segmentation, equating it merely to demographics or personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.

For example, two individuals, both 70+ years old, incredibly wealthy, living in a castle in the UK (like King Charles and Ozzy Osbourne), have dramatically different needs, values, and willingness to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. Basing strategies solely on personas can lead to missteps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

Segmentation must be rooted in:
*   What customers *need* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>
*   What they *value* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>
*   What they are *willing to pay for* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>

The goal is to `productize` and `package` to different segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>. Attempting a "one-size-fits-all" product often results in "one size fits none" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

### The "You Act Differently" Framework

The most crucial words in effective segmentation are "you act differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.
*   **You**: Refers to your product, sales, marketing, and finance teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.
*   **Act**: Means developing new products, building business cases, crafting product marketing messages, and sales strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.
*   **Differently**: Emphasizes that there's no point in segmentation if you treat everyone the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. Your approach to a customer should differ based on their needs, values, and willingness to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.

The objective is to identify market segments with similar needs and willingness to pay, and then build specific products for those segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### When to Segment

Even early-stage founders, despite feeling time-constrained, should consider segmentation from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. While you might not launch multiple products immediately, understanding who is willing to pay for your idea, what they need, and their market size allows you to prioritize your R&D roadmap and resources effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. This ensures your value messaging is tailored, and your product is understood and adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.

## Productizing to Segments: Examples

*   **Water Example**: Water is free from a fountain, $2 in a bottle, $2.50 with gas, and $5 from a mini-bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. It's the same water, but [[developing_differentiated_value | productized]] and packaged differently based on diverse customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
*   **Apple iPhone**: Apple offers iPhones from $299 to $1499, [[developing_differentiated_value | productizing]] to different segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>. Their strategy is to [[developing_differentiated_value | productize]] to different price points and willingness to pay, making them one of the most profitable companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>.
*   **Eventbrite**: Before IPO, Eventbrite had one product for all customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. After understanding their customer segments, they launched three plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. For instance, the entry-level plan allows one ticket type, while a middle plan offers unlimited ticket types, catering to different event hosting needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>.
*   **Uber**: Uber segments its service with different car types like Uber Black, UberX, and Uber Pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>. They also introduced "Comfort," which caters to specific needs like a quiet ride, demonstrating [[developing_differentiated_value | differentiated value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>. This illustrates *dynamic segmentation*, where customers might belong to different segments depending on their situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.
*   **SmugMug**: This company improved its revenue by double digits by changing its pricing plans from feature-based to benefit-based communication, without any product changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>. For instance, "ability to sell photos online" is a benefit, even if it's enabled by 15 underlying features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.
*   **Shopify**: Shopify's plans emphasize benefits over features, such as the "number of locations you can track inventory" as a key differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

## Packaging and Bundling: Leaders, Fillers, and Killers

The way to [[segmentation_versus_personas_in_marketing | unlock segmentation]] is through bundling and packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. This involves configuring your product based on customer needs, value, and willingness to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.

The **Leaders, Fillers, and Killers** framework helps categorize product features or offerings:
*   **Leaders**: These are the core benefits or products that people go for (e.g., the Big Mac in a Happy Meal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. If over 50% of people want something, it's typically a leader product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. They are the "must-have" or "table stakes" features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>.
*   **Fillers**: These are additional items that add value to a bundle and are often purchased if the price increase is marginal (e.g., French fries and Coke with a burger) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>. These are often the "nice-to-have" features that might be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>.
*   **Killers**: These are items that, if included in a bundle, would significantly reduce its appeal for most customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a> (e.g., coffee with a burger meal for the general public, though some individuals might want it as an add-on) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>. If 10-20% of customers intensely want something, it's usually an add-on, not something to bundle widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>. These are features customers "don't need" or "will not pay" for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.

Understanding these categories allows businesses to configure their products to maximize value for different segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.

## Behavioral Pricing

Behavioral pricing taps into the irrational aspects of human decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>, leveraging psychological principles to influence purchasing behavior without necessarily changing the core product or its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

Key tactics include:
*   **Decoy Effect**: Introducing a less attractive, higher-priced option can make a desired product seem more appealing (e.g., a $299 product making a $99 product look more attractive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>. Similarly, a seven-dollar small popcorn makes an eight-dollar extra-large popcorn seem like a better deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>.
*   **Compromise Effect**: People tend to avoid extremes and often choose a middle option when presented with "good, better, best" choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>. If too many customers are choosing the lowest-priced option, it might indicate that too much value is being given away in the entry-level product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. Adjusting features and benefits across packages can steer customers towards the middle tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>.
*   **Pennies-A-Day Effect**: Framing pricing in smaller units (e.g., "$1 a day" instead of "$30 a month") can make it seem more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>.
*   **Razor-Razor Blade Model**: Offering a base product cheaply to attract customers, then generating revenue from recurring consumables (e.g., printers and ink cartridges, or a base SaaS platform with usage-based consumables) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:01">[01:23:01]</a>. This appeals to customers who scrutinize upfront costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>.
*   **Panini Effect**: Leveraging the human compulsion to "complete puzzles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. By visually representing available products or services as a puzzle with completed and empty slots, companies can encourage customers to adopt more offerings (e.g., Starbucks' bingo card loyalty program) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>.

These strategies, along with understanding psychological price thresholds (e.g., $29 vs. $30, or $99 vs. $101), can significantly impact perceived value and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>.

### Pricing Strategies in a Slow Economy

In a slow economy, founders and product managers should:
1.  **Build a Less Expensive Alternate**: Instead of direct price discounting, create a "de-featured" version of your product to offer customers who face affordability issues. This helps retain them in the system and maintains price integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.
2.  **Employ Non-Pricing Actions**:
    *   **Give More Product**: Offer more value for the same price to loyal customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>.
    *   **Change Contract Terms**: Encourage longer contracts instead of reducing price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:30:42]</a>.
    *   **Adjust Payment Terms**: Extend payment deadlines instead of lowering the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:55">[01:30:55]</a>.
3.  **Consider Changing Your Pricing Model**: Explore [[product_management_strategies_and_frameworks | usage-based]] or attribution-based pricing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>. If customers' usage is low due to a downturn, a usage-based model feels fairer and can be adopted more easily, setting the stage for increased revenue when usage recovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:24">[01:31:24]</a>.

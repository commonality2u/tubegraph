VR Dheeman, who leads all aspects of product at Gojek, including [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product management]], design, program management, research, and insights with teams across India, Singapore, and Indonesia, is recognized as a prominent product leader in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He has a strong reputation for developing exceptional product and design talent and assisting individuals in transitioning into [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product management]] roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Career Growth Framework for Product Managers: The Three Ws

Based on observing [[traits_of_successful_product_managers | strong product managers]] and their rapid [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth]], VR Dheeman developed a [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth]] framework for [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This framework, known as the "Three Ws," consists of:
1.  What you produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
2.  What you bring to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
3.  What your operating model is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>

[[traits_of_successful_product_managers | Strong product managers]] typically excel in at least two or all three of these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### 1. What You Produce: Outputs and Outcomes

When starting in a [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] career, the initial focus should be on *outputs* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Outputs are tangible deliverables that don't require extensive strategy or visualization, allowing for quick action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Examples include:
*   Launching a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
*   Analyzing and running experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
*   Contributing to a go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>
*   Producing initial drafts for briefs, slides, or legal reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>

The emphasis early on is on getting things done and being useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. As a [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] gains comfort with outputs and working with stakeholders, they transition to focusing on *outcomes* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Outcomes involve owning or collaborating on product area goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Even at senior levels, it's crucial not to forget individual contributor (IC) roots and be willing to do the hands-on work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### 2. What You Bring to the Table: Impact on Impact

This aspect focuses on how a [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] contributes to the *impact* of the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. It's not enough for a product area to be successful; the [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] must demonstrate their useful contribution to that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This includes:
*   Producing high-quality product artifacts (e.g., PRDs, product notes, product strategy documents, design briefs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   Ensuring pre-iteration planning runs properly and Jira storyboards are well-described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

[[the_role_of_a_product_manager | Product managers]] are evaluated on four key [[key_skills_for_product_managers | pillars]]: data and metrics, design and research, technology [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]], and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Demonstrating proficiency in these areas through tangible artifacts is vital for [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

### 3. What Your Operating Model Is: Communication and Collaboration

The operating model, which encompasses communication, collaboration, organizational, and community [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]], is particularly crucial for transitioning from mid-senior to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. For [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product managers]] working with other stakeholders, three tenets are important:
1.  Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
2.  Bring out important topics without drawing importance to oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
3.  Be in charge of getting decisions made, not making all decisions yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

These tenets help foster successful relationships across stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. A [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] should be seen as someone who adds value and advances the product, rather than an obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Bringing conversations to a logical, rather than emotional, space is an effective way to push back on ideas constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

## Navigating the Ambiguity of the Product Manager Role

The definition of [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product management]] remains somewhat ambiguous, varying across technology companies, and even within different teams and divisions of large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. This confusion extends to other stakeholders, who often question what is expected of a [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

A general guideline is: if something is blocking the progress on the product, the [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | Product management]] combines both art and science, with frameworks and methods helping to master the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

Instead of trying to figure out "what is [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product management]]," [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product managers]] should focus on their specific contribution and output across key [[key_skills_for_product_managers | axes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.

### The Product Manager as a Co-Collaborator and Community Enabler

A [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] acts as the central co-collaborator for various disciplines within an organization, including strategy, technology, design, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>. They are the only discipline that pairs with everyone else, providing a unique holistic insight into the team's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

The [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] is also a "community enabler" within the team and organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. This "software aspect" ties everyone together towards a common mission of delivering output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>. This community role is increasingly important for remote or distributed teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

Essentially, a [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]]'s role is to clarify and advance the team's overall contribution, energy, and output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. It's about playing a necessary role, not just holding a specific title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

## Core Competencies for Product Managers

To facilitate [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | growth]] and effectiveness, [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product managers]] should focus on developing [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]] across several key areas:

*   **Data and Metrics**: From understanding basic metrics to being able to define user problems and tie them to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.
*   **Design and Research**: The ability to identify user problems from a user perspective and connect them to business objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
*   **Technology [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]]**: Ranging from basic understanding of concepts like HTTP and API to being able to engage in deep technical debates and write design documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Focuses on defining "how to climb the mountain" once the "mountain" (corporate or business goal) has been set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>. This includes defining user segments, their needs, and the product development order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **Communication**: Effectively conveying ideas and information.
*   **Collaboration**: Working effectively with diverse stakeholders and teams.
*   **Organizational [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]]**: Managing tasks, processes, and aligning efforts.
*   **Community [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]]**: Fostering a cohesive and productive environment.

For career development, it's recommended to pick one area from data or tech and one from design and research to focus on, especially if transitioning from a different background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. Once these are demonstrated, focus can shift to strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. Soft [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]] like communication, collaboration, and community engagement are lifelong learning areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.

## Impediments to Career Growth

Several mindset [[challenges_in_product_management | challenges]] can hinder a [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]]'s [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth]]:
*   **Focusing on uncontrollable factors**: Mid-senior [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product managers]] sometimes shift focus from what they can control (their craft, output, learning) to what they cannot (organizational issues, stakeholder behavior, project assignments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | Growth]] occurs when the focus remains on controllable elements like the "Three Ws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Relationship with change**: As [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product managers]] become more senior, their rate of skill acquisition and adaptation might slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Continually increasing one's "rate of change" by benchmarking against industry bests or other functions helps maintain [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.
*   **Self-perception and narratives**: The stories [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product managers]] tell themselves about their attributes (e.g., "high agency," "hyper-collaborative") can become self-limiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. These narratives can justify shortcomings (e.g., being brash because one is "high agency") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. Correcting these internal narratives is crucial for getting back on a [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | growth]] path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

### Overcoming Discouragement and Leveraging Feedback

[[the_role_of_a_product_manager | Product managers]] can feel discouraged when comparing themselves to highly skilled peers, but it's important to channel this into motivation for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. The ambiguity of [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product management]] means feedback can come from many dimensions, not all of them equally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.

Key advice for leveraging feedback:
*   **Receive feedback openly**: View feedback as a gift, even if it's internally difficult to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
*   **Channel feedback strategically**: Focus on areas targeted for [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.
*   **Prioritize improvement**: Don't try to improve every area at once. Pick one area with maximum leverage for impact, especially if you're struggling significantly in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.

SAFe, or the Scaled Agile Framework, emerged from the desire to [[scaled_agile_framework_vs_traditional_methods | scale Scrum]] and other agile processes within large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is frequently adopted by large companies that traditionally did not grow up building software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.

## Origin and Appeal of SAFe
The agile movement began in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto, written by software developers who aimed to develop software better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. Key figures like Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland codified Scrum, which many companies base their agile practices on today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>. Scrum introduces roles like the Product Owner and Scrum Master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27">[01:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>.

SAFe emerged as a way to scale Scrum across multiple teams in large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. It is notable for its comprehensive, prescribed operating model for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. This structured approach, often presented as a "map" that tells organizations "everything you need to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>, is highly attractive to executives who are new to managing technology organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.

## SAFe's Structure and Roles
In SAFe, the Product Owner is typically part of the agile team alongside Scrum Masters and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. The Product Manager, in contrast, often sits with a system architect and a Release Train Engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>, which implies a split between strategic (Product Manager) and tactical (Product Owner) responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. SAFe includes practices like "Big Room Planning," where entire Release Trains (multiple agile teams) come together quarterly to commit to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

The Product Owner role, as defined by Scrum and subsequently adopted by SAFe, did not originate from product management as it's known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Instead, it was designed to help developers prioritize their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. Early Scrum guides suggested the Product Owner could be a Product Manager for commercial development or a user department manager for in-house efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>. However, later versions of the Scrum Guide removed the explicit mention of the Product Manager, leading to a broader interpretation of the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

## Implementation Challenges
Melissa Perry, CEO and founder of Product Institute, strongly advises against using SAFe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>. She notes that almost everyone who found initial success with SAFe eventually "ripped it up and made it into something else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

Common issues with SAFe implementation include:
*   **Overkill and Dogma**: SAFe can be an "overkill" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>, leading to excessive meetings and a rigid adherence to process over delivering value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. This contrasts with the agile principle of "inspect and adapt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
*   **Lack of Discovery**: Product owners in SAFe often lack time for customer research and discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>, becoming "order takers" who merely write user stories to keep developers busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. This disconnect from customer needs hinders the ability to build the "right" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This is a common [[challenges_and_strategies_for_implementing_continuous_discovery_in_organizations | challenge in implementing continuous discovery]].
*   **Misconception of Roles**: There's a significant misunderstanding about what Product Owners should be doing compared to traditional product management practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. This leads to developers becoming reliant on product owners, hindering team autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.
*   **Organizational Design**: Many organizations adopting SAFe reorganize by component, leading to product owners managing very narrow scopes and sometimes inventing work to keep teams busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
*   **Lack of Strategic Leadership**: SAFe often doesn't address the roles and responsibilities of senior product leaders (Directors, VPs, CPOs), creating a gap in how to define product strategy and connect it to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>.

## Why SAFe is Adopted Despite Challenges
Despite the challenges, SAFe continues to be adopted by many large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. Executives are attracted to its promise of a clear, prescriptive plan for software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>, especially for those new to [[adapting_to_ai_driven_changes_in_organizations | digital transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>. The framework is heavily marketed as a plug-and-play solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

It's also important to note the business model behind SAFe and other agile certifications: they make money through consulting and training, incentivizing wider adoption regardless of actual effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. Consulting firms like McKinsey also play a significant role in introducing SAFe to large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>.

## Recommendations for Digital Transformation and Product Management
For companies undergoing [[challenges_in_agile_transformations_within_nonsoftware_native_companies | digital transformations]], Melissa Perry suggests focusing on developing a comprehensive operating model, not just a development framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. This includes:
1.  **Product Strategy**: Clearly defining product strategy and ensuring it ties back to company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.
2.  **Organizational Design**: Organizing teams effectively around products with skilled product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>.
3.  **Product Operations**: Establishing infrastructure for data access and customer interaction to enable product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
4.  **Culture and Incentives**: Shifting from rewarding mere "shipping" to rewarding value delivery and impact on business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. This helps in [[implementing_technical_and_cultural_practices_for_efficient_software_development | implementing technical and cultural practices for efficient software development]].
5.  **Leadership and Experienced Hires**: Bringing in experienced product leaders who can guide the transformation and mentor internal talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. This is crucial for [[innovating_within_large_organizations | innovating within large organizations]].

## Advice for Product Owners in SAFe Environments
For individuals in a Product Owner role within a SAFe organization:
*   **Question and Challenge**: Don't be afraid to question what the team is working on and push back if it's not delivering value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>. A key question to ask is: "What do we hope will happen when we release this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   **Seek Customer Interaction**: Proactively seek opportunities to engage with customers and gather insights, even if it's considered the Product Manager's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on Value and Outcomes**: Prioritize delivering measurable value and impact on business metrics rather than just ticking off user stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
*   **Advocate for Career Paths**: Ask leaders about career paths to Product Manager roles, as many organizations lack clear trajectories for Product Owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. Product Owner is not a long-term, independent career path and should evolve into a Product Manager role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.
*   **Rethink Certifications**: Be cautious about relying solely on agile certifications (like Certified Scrum Product Owner or CSPO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>. These are often two-day classes that don't prepare individuals for the full scope of product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>. Tech companies value experience and outcomes over certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.
*   **Update Your Resume**: When seeking new roles, describe your work from a value perspective, focusing on problems solved and metrics moved, rather than process-oriented tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.

## The Path Forward
Transformation is possible, and large, non-software native companies can [[strategies_for_building_products_at_large_companies | build great products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>. The key is to:
*   **Embrace Agile Principles**: Focus on moving quickly and delivering great value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>.
*   **Adapt Processes**: Be willing to "inspect and adapt" processes, changing what isn't serving the company's best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.
*   **Invest in Product Leadership**: Ensure C-suite understands the strategic importance of software and appoints Chief Product Officers to drive vision and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>. This allows for [[scaling_and_automating_business_processes | scaling and automating business processes]] with a product-led approach.
*   **Foster Continuous Learning**: Provide opportunities for product people to learn from experienced peers, internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.

Successful transformations involve a mix of retaining existing talent while bringing in experienced individuals who can mentor and elevate the product capabilities of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>. This holistic approach, rather than a rigid adherence to frameworks like SAFe, leads to sustained success in the digital age.

Claire Butler joined Figma as their 10th employee and first marketing hire, before the product even launched [01:05:00]. Over eight years, she has led their initial launch, go-to-market strategy, branding, positioning, and messaging. She continues to lead their go-to-market efforts, bottom-up growth motion, community, events, social advocacy, and Figma for Education teams [01:09:00]. Her experience offers an in-depth look into [[figmas_approach_to_productled_growth_and_community_building|how Figma grew and continues to grow]] [01:28:00].

## Early Days at Figma

Figma's early days were characterized by an oscillation between high-level strategic decisions and basic "grunt work" [00:43:00]. Claire's first day involved immediately reacting to and ultimately changing the product name from "Summit" to "Figma" after presenting her arguments to Dylan Field, Figma's CEO [00:54:00, 01:06:00]. Just a week later, she was carrying four heavy bags of ice for an early meetup with about 10 people [06:27:00, 06:46:00].

The most stressful period for Claire was launching Figma out of stealth. As the sole marketer, she lacked a mentor and had to handle all messaging, positioning, press, and PR, which led to self-doubt [08:37:00, 09:03:00]. Overcoming this involved trusting her intuition and Dylan's lead, and simply "going for it" [09:44:00].

Claire joined Figma because the basic premise of online, collaborative design "logically clicked" for her, especially given her experience working with designers via inefficient email feedback [10:54:00, 11:15:00]. She also trusted early investors like Index and Danny Rimer, and advisors like John Lily, who believed in the company [11:21:00]. Lastly, Dylan Field's persuasive nature and determination to address concerns convinced her [11:45:00].

## The Bottom-Up Go-to-Market Motion

Figma's bottom-up go-to-market (GTM) motion is focused on individual contributors (ICs) [01:03:00]. The strategy involves two main parts:
1.  Getting ICs at a company to deeply love the product [01:34:00].
2.  Enabling them to spread the product within their organization [01:36:00].

This approach is distinct from traditional top-down SaaS models where sales target VPs or executive buyers [01:05:00]. For Figma, it's about practitioners loving the tool so much that they are willing to put their social capital on the line to spread it [01:32:00, 01:36:00]. This GTM motion was highly efficient for Figma, allowing them to operate without a sales team for the first three years, relying solely on self-served revenue [01:33:00, 01:40:00, 01:51:00]. A significant portion of Figma's marketing qualified leads (MQLs) for sales still originate from their free tier, where users eventually approach Figma for enterprise solutions, often to navigate security or procurement challenges within their large organizations [01:13:00, 01:46:00].

Figma's unique take on bottom-up growth is rooted in its "obsession with quality and with craft within the editor" [01:18:00]. Even small improvements, like saving one click, are hugely significant for designers who spend eight hours a day in the tool [01:55:00, 02:07:00]. While collaboration is a key differentiator, the fundamental love for the tool itself is paramount [01:33:00, 01:49:00].

### Decision to Launch from Stealth

Figma was in stealth for three to four years, from its founding in 2012 to its launch in late 2015 [01:13:00]. The team decided to launch due to a holistic desire to get out of stealth for momentum and team motivation, as building in isolation for so long was demotivating [01:50:00].

A key consideration was the absence of multiplayer functionality, which was Figma's core differentiator [01:04:00, 02:20:00]. Despite this, the team wanted to launch to gather more user feedback and iterate [02:10:00]. Claire and Dylan would frequently demo Figma to companies, and while some were uninterested, others, especially designers, were "really interested in it and cared about it" [02:30:00, 02:50:00, 02:59:00]. Claire noted the moment designers would "take the laptop out of Dylan's hands" to play with the product as a strong signal of product-market fit, even before knowing if teams would buy or use it full-time [02:11:00, 02:14:00, 02:27:00, 02:31:00].

Early metrics were less important than qualitative "signal" [02:32:00, 02:56:00]. The focus was on getting one company, then two, to use and pay for the product [02:44:00]. An example of this hyper-focus on early users is the story of Kota, Figma's first user in Palo Alto [03:13:00]. When Kota's engineer, Philip, couldn't open a file due to a MacBook issue, Dylan Field instructed the team to "drop everything" to fix it [03:34:00, 03:56:00]. Evan Wallace, Figma's CTO, was driven down to Palo Alto by Dylan to fix the MacBook, highlighting the extreme measures taken to retain early users [03:08:00].

A significant sign of product-market fit came when Microsoft's Zamarin team, initially using Figma on credit cards, eventually approached Figma, demanding an Enterprise product due to the widespread, uncontrolled adoption within their organization [02:12:00, 02:26:00, 02:30:00, 02:35:00]. This demonstrated the power of the bottom-up model, where internal champions drove adoption to the point that the company itself sought a formal relationship [02:51:00, 03:01:00]. Figma even developed internal "node graphs" to visualize how individual users and teams organically spread the product within large organizations [02:34:00, 02:46:00].

## Getting ICs to Love the Product (Step 1)

Figma focused on four key areas to foster user love, especially in the early days:

1.  **Credibility**: Designers dislike traditional marketing and have a "high BS meter" [03:22:00, 03:26:00]. Figma built credibility by:
    *   **Focusing on Technical Content**: Engineers (like Evan Wallace) and designers created in-depth articles about the technical feats of Figma (e.g., using WebGL, Vector Networks, grids based on Joseph MÃ¼ller-Brockmann principles) [03:31:00, 03:37:00, 03:52:00]. Content was deemed "good enough" if Claire, as a non-designer, didn't fully understand it or couldn't have written it herself [03:37:00, 03:41:00]. This approach kept users engaged even before multiplayer was available [03:45:00].
    *   **Hiring a [[developing_user_empathy_and_gathering_insights_for_product_development|Designer Advocate]]**: The first marketing-related hire was a designer, who became a full-time advocate to meet with users, gather feedback, create content, and represent the user base internally [03:54:00, 04:03:00]. This role remains crucial for Figma's go-to-market efforts [04:09:00].

2.  **Building with Users**: Figma adopted a deep customer obsession by actively listening to and building with users [03:40:00].
    *   **Direct Support**: In the early days, everyone, including Dylan and engineers, participated in Intercom chats, often debugging the product live with users or immediately fixing bugs [03:52:00, 04:04:00].
    *   **User Ownership**: Promptly addressing user feedback and fixing issues made users feel "invested in your journey with you" and created a strong relationship [04:10:00, 04:18:00]. This high level of "love" is essential because users must "put their social capital on the line" to spread the product within an organization [04:32:00, 04:41:00].

3.  **Finding Connection Channels**: Figma aimed to connect with users where they already existed, rather than forcing them to come to Figma's own platforms [04:47:00, 04:59:00].
    *   **Twitter Strategy**: Dylan identified Twitter as the primary hub for the design community [04:51:00]. He built a scraper to identify influencers and their networks within design-related topics (e.g., iconography, graphic design, product management) [04:57:00, 05:27:00]. Figma directly messaged these influential users for feedback and pushed technical content through Twitter [04:58:00, 05:15:00].
    *   **Personal Presence**: Dylan and Sho (Figma's CTO) maintained a strong personal presence on Twitter, interacting directly with users, answering questions, and building a highly engaged community [05:31:00, 05:44:00, 05:50:00]. This allowed users to passively follow Figma and build confidence over time without immediate commitment [04:55:00, 05:05:00].

4.  **Transparency and Authenticity**: Figma cultivated strong relationships by being honest and transparent, not hiding behind the brand [03:55:00, 03:58:00].
    *   **Downtime Post-Mortems**: Figma openly shared public post-mortems for outages, taking full accountability, and detailing technical reasons and fixes [05:40:00, 05:55:00].
    *   **Acquisition Announcement**: During the highly stressful acquisition announcement, Figma chose transparency. Instead of a brand statement, they retweeted Dylan Field's personal announcement and held an open Twitter Space the next day with Dylan, Sho, Rajie, and Tom to directly answer user questions [05:48:00, 05:59:00, 06:18:00]. This honest approach helped turn the tide of public perception [05:49:00, 06:01:00, 06:11:00, 06:18:00].

## Helping the Product Spread Within Organizations (Step 2)

Once users loved Figma, the next step was to enable and support them in spreading the product internally.

1.  **Make it Easy to Try and Share**: Figma ensured a low barrier to entry and frictionless sharing.
    *   **Robust Free Tier**: Figma offers a free account and it's easy to create a free team [01:37:00, 01:41:00].
    *   **Unlimited Collaborators on Starter Teams**: Initially, the free "starter team" had limited collaborators [01:20:00]. Figma realized this was a hindrance to growth and changed it to allow unlimited collaborators but limited files [01:24:00]. This change significantly boosted sharing and adoption within teams before they needed to pay [01:29:00].
    *   **Free Viewers**: The pricing model specifically charges for editors, but viewers (e.g., product managers who only comment) are free [01:52:00, 01:57:00]. This allows Figma to penetrate organizations more widely and increase its usefulness to more people [01:58:00, 02:07:00].
    *   **Pacing Payment**: Not introducing payment too fast allows users time to build advocacy and try out the product with their teams [01:14:00, 01:21:00].

2.  **[[challenges_and_lessons_in_product_management_at_figma|Designer Advocates]] in the Sales Process**: The [[challenges_and_lessons_in_product_management_at_figma|Designer Advocate]] role was pivotal in the sales process.
    *   **The "Tom Factor"**: Tom Lowry, a passionate Figma user who had successfully championed Figma's adoption at his previous company, joined Figma as the second [[challenges_and_lessons_in_product_management_at_figma|Designer Advocate]] on the same day the first salesperson was hired [01:06:00, 01:08:00]. Tom, without a sales quota, would join sales calls to explain the product to other designers [01:08:00, 01:10:00]. His deep technical understanding and empathy with designers made him incredibly effective, leading to an increased likelihood of deals closing, a phenomenon known as the "Tom Factor" [01:10:00, 01:12:00].
    *   **Scaling Advocates**: This model scaled into dedicated teams of [[challenges_and_lessons_in_product_management_at_figma|Designer Advocates]], Developer Advocates, and FigJam Advocates, both regionally and across products. They serve as "magic dust" for marketing, product, and sales, providing credibility and synthesizing user feedback [01:02:00, 01:08:00, 01:19:00, 01:22:00].

3.  **Leveraging Design Systems**: Figma turned a major blocker into a key adoption driver.
    *   **Initial Blocker**: Early on, large companies were hesitant to adopt Figma because it lacked robust support for Design Systems, which are crucial for efficiency and consistency in large design and engineering teams [01:11:00, 01:27:00].
    *   **Strategic Focus**: Figma's product team, led by Dylan, began holding informal meetups with Design Systems practitioners to learn their needs [01:13:00, 01:21:00]. They then built features and content around Design Systems, focusing on technical aspects and advanced use cases [01:24:00, 01:30:00].
    *   **Growth Driver**: This focus led to dedicated resources like designsystems.com and the "Schema" conference for advanced practitioners [01:39:00, 01:42:00]. Design Systems became a primary reason for companies to upgrade from Pro to Org/Enterprise tiers, winning over influential Design Systems practitioners who were often "the biggest blockers or the biggest champions" [01:34:00, 01:44:00].

4.  **Maintaining Champion Relationships**: The relationship with internal champions needs to be continuously nurtured [01:21:00, 01:25:00].
    *   **Ongoing Engagement**: Figma stays connected with champions, promptly addressing concerns (e.g., a frustrated user tweeting about an issue) [01:30:00, 01:40:00].
    *   **Mutual Growth**: Figma actively helps champions grow their own careers and profiles (e.g., speaking at Figma events, social media amplification) [01:48:00, 01:54:00]. This creates a mutually beneficial cycle, as these technically expert champions further amplify Figma's reach and credibility [01:54:00, 01:57:00].

## Prerequisites for This Approach

This bottom-up, community-led growth approach is particularly effective under certain conditions:

*   **Technical, Craft-Oriented Audience**: The target audience should be technical professionals who deeply care about the "craft" of their work and their tools (e.g., designers, engineers) [01:51:00, 01:57:00, 02:03:00]. This allows the product to provide significant single-player value before collaboration is needed, offering topics beyond "collaboration" to discuss [01:59:00, 02:17:00].
*   **Existing Community**: It helps if the target audience already has an established online community (like designers on Twitter) [02:57:00, 02:00:00]. This provides a pre-existing distribution channel, making it easier to engage users rather than having to build a community from scratch [02:09:00, 02:16:00].
*   **Highly Collaborative Role**: The IC audience should have many natural "connection points" within an organization, allowing them to easily spread the product. Designers, for instance, collaborate extensively with product managers, engineers, and other teams, making them "super spreaders" [02:24:00, 02:37:00].
*   **Leadership Belief and Intuition**: An executive leader, like Dylan Field, must deeply believe in this approach and be willing to trust intuition and qualitative "signal" over immediate, small-scale metrics, especially in the early stages where data is scarce [02:58:00, 03:01:00, 03:08:00, 03:10:00].

## Scaling Challenges

As Figma scaled, the challenge became how to maintain and protect this bottom-up model while layering on more traditional top-down motions, such as building a sales team [01:18:00, 01:27:00]. Key strategies for sustained growth included:
*   Continuing to run large-scale events like Config and Schema [01:44:00, 01:47:00].
*   Scaling the [[challenges_and_lessons_in_product_management_at_figma|Designer Advocate]] team across regions and products [01:47:00, 01:53:00].
*   Constantly advocating for and protecting these core bottom-up drivers to prevent breaking what has been working [01:03:00, 01:04:00, 01:06:00].

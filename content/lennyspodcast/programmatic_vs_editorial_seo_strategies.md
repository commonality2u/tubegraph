In the evolving landscape of Search Engine Optimization ([[SEO Best Practices and Content Strategy | SEO]]), especially with the rise of AI, traditional approaches are being challenged. Eli Schwarz, a growth advisor specializing in [[SEO Best Practices and Content Strategy | SEO]], highlights a significant shift towards thinking of [[SEO as a product and collaboration with product teams | SEO as a product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This perspective leads to a crucial distinction between two main strategies: [[Understanding and implementing editorial and programmatic SEO | programmatic]] and [[Understanding and implementing editorial and programmatic SEO | editorial]] [[SEO Best Practices and Content Strategy | SEO]].

## Understanding the Strategies

### Programmatic SEO
[[Understanding and implementing editorial and programmatic SEO | Programmatic SEO]] involves taking numerous data sources and programmatically generating pages that combine this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:25">[07:25:25]</a>. It's about building a product around what the company is attempting to monetize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:56">[05:50:56]</a>.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Scalability:** Ideal for creating a large number of pages automatically from structured data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:16">[06:30:16]</a>.
*   **User Problem-Solving:** Focuses on addressing specific user needs or combinations of needs that can be met with data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:36">[06:33:36]</a>.
*   **Direct Product Integration:** The generated pages often lead directly to product usage or monetization within the user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:59">[05:59:59]</a>.

**Examples of Successful Programmatic SEO:**
*   **[[Zapier | Zapier]]** Eli Schwarz assisted [[Zapier | Zapier]] in creating pages for connecting different software applications (e.g., "Gmail to Salesforce"). Users were looking for ways to make their tools work together, even if they didn't know [[Zapier | Zapier]] existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:16">[02:52:16]</a>. This built a flywheel effect, showcasing the product's capabilities at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>.
*   **[[Tinder | Tinder]]** Recognizing [[Tinder | Tinder]] as a "loneliness solving solution," pages were built for "online dating in [city]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:30">[02:58:30]</a>. These pages suggested places to go on dates and offered [[Tinder | Tinder]] as the solution to their loneliness problem, directly leading to app downloads and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Trip Advisor** This platform took in data sources for hotels and cities, combining them with user-generated content (UGC) to create comprehensive pages for each property. This programmatic approach has allowed them to dominate search results for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>.
*   **Zillow** Zillow solved the problem of users not knowing property values by integrating government data, comparison data, photos, neighborhood data, and school data into programmatic pages. [[SEO Best Practices and Content Strategy | SEO]] is often the only channel to bring traffic to these specific property pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:16">[07:16:16]</a>.
*   **[[Canva | Canva]]** Their success lies in offering templates that feed into their monetization model, encouraging users to build off those templates with upgrades and subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:42">[05:10:42]</a>.
*   **[[Survey Monkey | Survey Monkey]]** For a survey product, offering survey templates is a [[Understanding and implementing editorial and programmatic SEO | programmatic]] approach that directly leads to product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:02">[05:37:02]</a>.

### Editorial SEO
[[Understanding and implementing editorial and programmatic SEO | Editorial SEO]] typically involves creating long-form content, such as blog posts, articles, and guides. Historically, this meant trying to rank for broad, "top of funnel" keywords by creating extensive content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Content Creation:** Human-written articles and blog posts.
*   **Top-of-Funnel Focus:** Often aims to capture broad searches and general interest.
*   **Information-Heavy:** Provides detailed explanations and opinions.

**Examples:**
*   A travel site writing a long-form blog post about "best beach vacations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   WebMD creating generic content about the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.
*   Sites like G2, CapTerra, or Forbes writing articles on "top CRM tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>.

## The Impact of AI on SEO Strategies

The rise of AI overviews in search results is significantly changing the landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These AI-generated answers provide direct information at the top of the search results, reducing the need for users to click on links for basic "top of funnel" queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:53">[01:39:53]</a>.

*   **Decline of Top-of-Funnel Editorial Content:** For general informational queries (e.g., "what is a CRM?", "what are top podcast tools?"), AI overviews will summarize the answers, making long editorial blog posts less relevant for direct traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:18">[02:18:18]</a>.
*   **Shift to Mid-to-Bottom Funnel:** The new paradigm means [[SEO Best Practices and Content Strategy | SEO]] success lies more in the "mid-funnel" and "bottom-of-funnel" where users have clearer intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:59">[01:33:59]</a>. For example, after an AI overview suggests Cancun for a beach vacation, the user will then search for specific Cancun hotels or flights â€“ this is where [[SEO Best Practices and Content Strategy | SEO]] matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Relevance for Programmatic:** [[Understanding and implementing editorial and programmatic SEO | Programmatic SEO]] is less affected by AI overviews because it focuses on solving a very specific user problem (e.g., connecting two apps, finding a specific property value, or dating in a new city) that often requires direct interaction with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>.

## Deciding Which Strategy to Use

The decision hinges on the **user journey** and the **intent** of the user.
*   **Understand the User:** The first step is to empathize with the user and understand what they are searching for that would lead them to your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:54">[03:19:54]</a>. If a user isn't actively searching for a solution your product provides, [[SEO Best Practices and Content Strategy | SEO]] might not be the right channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:12">[03:22:12]</a>.
*   **Consider the "Problem-Solution" Fit:** If your product solves a problem that users are actively searching for (e.g., "best podcast tools" leading to a comparison tool, then "Riverside price" leading to a conversion), then [[SEO Best Practices and Content Strategy | SEO]] can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>.
*   **Programmatic for Scale and Specificity:** If there's a vast number of specific user problems that can be solved by combining data, [[Understanding and implementing editorial and programmatic SEO | programmatic SEO]] is the more effective and scalable choice (e.g., housing prices, hotel reviews, software integrations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:16">[06:30:16]</a>.
*   **Editorial for Niche or Brand Building:** While general editorial content is less impactful for direct conversions, it can still serve niche purposes or contribute to [[Role and hiring strategies for SEO experts | brand building]] and thought leadership if executed strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:06">[07:56:06]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

*   **[[SEO as a product and collaboration with product teams | SEO is a product question]]**: It's about creating a valuable experience for the user coming from search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. Product managers should collaborate closely with marketing to understand user needs and position the product accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:36">[02:36:36]</a>.
*   **Focus on Intent:** Prioritize mid-to-bottom funnel searches where users have a clear intention to take an action or buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:59">[01:33:59]</a>.
*   **Avoid "Slop Content":** Don't create content just for the sake of it, especially with [[Using AI to optimize SEO efforts | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. Content should be helpful and useful to the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. [[Using AI to optimize SEO efforts | AI]] can be a tool to generate product descriptions or summarize data, but not to create generic, low-value blog posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>.
*   **[[SEO resource allocation vs advertisement spending | SEO is not free]]**: It requires significant investment in time, resources, and often direct expenses for product managers, engineers, designers, and content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:16">[03:30:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Measure Conversions, Not Just Traffic:** Success should be measured by business metrics like MQLs (marketing qualified leads), actual purchases, or goal completions, not just traffic volume or rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Traffic that doesn't convert is worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
*   **[[Role and hiring strategies for SEO experts | Link building is brand building]]**: Authentic links come from creating a valuable product and brand that people want to mention and link to, not from buying guest posts on irrelevant sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>. Google can increasingly recognize mentions without direct HTML links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.
*   **[[SEO Best Practices and Content Strategy | Technical SEO]] is for Scale:** For most small to medium websites, investing heavily in [[SEO Best Practices and Content Strategy | technical SEO]] beyond best practices is often a waste of resources. It's crucial for very large sites like Zillow or Airbnb with millions of pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:11">[01:35:11]</a>.
*   **Keyword Tools are Indicative, Not Exact:** Keyword research tools provide order of magnitude and relative comparison, but their exact volume numbers can be highly inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>. Use a top-down, TAM (Total Addressable Market) based approach for forecasting [[SEO resource allocation vs advertisement spending | SEO]] upside, starting with your target market size and segmenting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:46">[01:38:46]</a>.

Ultimately, [[SEO Best Practices and Content Strategy | SEO]] is not a "dark art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. It's about understanding your user, providing a useful product, and optimizing that product for search visibility, especially in the context of the evolving AI-powered search landscape.

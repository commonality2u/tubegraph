Effective communication, particularly when speaking on the spot, is a crucial skill that becomes even more important as one advances in their career [01:46:17]. Matt Abrahams, a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and host of the *Think Fast, Talk Smart* podcast, emphasizes that while public speaking can induce anxiety, there are practical techniques to improve both impromptu speaking and the delivery of specific communications like feedback and apologies [01:19:19]. The core principle for effective on-the-spot communication is that "you actually have to prepare to be spontaneous" [01:15:15].

## Strategies for Effective Feedback

Giving feedback is a common on-the-spot communication scenario in professional settings, such as discussing designs, roadmaps, or strategies [00:01:32].

This perspective shifts the focus from simply critiquing to collaborating with the other person to work on a challenge [00:53:05].

### Core Principles for Feedback
*   **Collaboration:** Invite the other person to join in problem-solving rather than bestowing an opinion upon them [00:53:07].
*   **Authenticity:** Approach the conversation with genuine intent to help, rather than just going through the motions [00:50:50].
*   **Preparation:** While feedback is often given on the spot, having a mental framework can significantly ease the process [00:53:50].

### Structures for Delivering Feedback

Having a structure helps to package information in a way that is easy for the recipient to digest and also helps the giver formulate their thoughts [00:53:42].

#### What, So What, Now What
This structure is particularly useful for quickly structuring information [00:53:57].
*   **What:** Describe the specific event or behavior [00:54:14].
    *   *Example:* "When you talked about the implementation plan, you spoke a little quicker than you did with the other parts and you didn't go into the same level of detail." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>
*   **So What:** Explain the importance and relevance of the behavior or why it matters [00:54:17].
    *   *Example:* "When you speak quickly without a lot of detail, people might think you're not as prepared or you're really concerned about this part." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>
*   **Now What:** Suggest what should happen next or what action to take [00:54:23].
    *   *Example:* "Next time I suggest you slow down and you include these two, three bits of data so that people see you really are knowledgeable on this area." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>

#### The Four I's
This robust structure helps to ensure comprehensive feedback [00:54:52].
*   **Information:** Set the context, so the person knows what the feedback is about [00:55:04].
    *   *Example:* "This is the third time that you have showed up late to this meeting." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>
*   **Impact:** Share the effect the behavior has had on you, the feedback giver [00:55:10].
    *   *Example:* "I feel you're not prioritizing this meeting the same way others of us are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>
*   **Invitation:** Invite the other person to collaborate on a solution [00:55:15].
    *   *Example:* "What can we do to help make sure you show up prepared for the next meeting?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>
*   **Implications (or Consequences):** Discuss the benefits of changing the behavior or the consequences of not changing [00:55:17].
    *   *Example:* "Because if you do, we're going to finish the project on time and get a new cool project." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>

Kim Scott's concept of [[candor_and_direct_feedback | Radical Candor]] aligns with these structured approaches, emphasizing directness combined with care [00:53:25].

## Making Apologies Effectively

Apologizing is another crucial on-the-spot communication skill [01:07:27].

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
*   **Insufficient Apology:** Many people fail to apologize directly or take full responsibility [01:07:34].
*   **Blaming the Victim:** Avoid saying "I'm sorry that *you* feel bad," as this shifts responsibility away from your actions [01:07:46]. An apology should be for the transgression, not the other person's feelings [01:07:40].

### The AAA Approach for Apologies
This three-step structure provides a clear path for sincere apologies [01:08:13].
*   **Acknowledge:** Clearly state what you did wrong, focusing on the specific behavior or offense [01:08:18].
    *   *Example:* "I'm very sorry for interrupting what you were saying. I over-spoke when you were talking." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>
*   **Appreciate:** Express understanding or appreciation for the difficulty or impact your action caused [01:08:18].
    *   *Example:* "I can imagine my doing that made you feel bad and you feel that you didn't get your fair share of sharing your point of view." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>
*   **Amend:** State what specific action you will take to remedy the situation or prevent it from happening again [01:08:18]. This demonstrates commitment to change [01:08:46].
    *   *Example:* "Next time I will work not to do this. In fact, I will wait till you're done and I will actually paraphrase what you said before I contribute my point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>

## General Principles for On-the-Spot Communication

Effective feedback and apologies are part of a broader skill set for on-the-spot communication.

### You Can Get Better
*   **It's a Skill:** Spontaneous speaking is not an innate gift; it's a skill that can be developed and improved with practice [03:49:55].
*   **Preparation is Key:** Just like athletes practice to perform spontaneously in their sport, preparing with structures and techniques helps you to be spontaneous in communication [00:21:00].

### Mindset and Approach
*   **[[practical_advice_on_delivering_and_receiving_feedback | Strive for Connection Over Perfection]]:** Instead of aiming for the "best" answer or being "most interesting," focus on simply getting the task done and connecting with your audience [00:46:57]. This reduces self-evaluation, freeing up cognitive resources [00:44:00].
*   **Normalize Anxiety:** Many people, even experienced speakers, feel nervous [01:54:00]. Recognizing that anxiety is a normal human condition when communicating in front of others can reduce pressure [01:54:55].
*   **Reframe Excitement:** Physical symptoms of anxiety (fast heart rate, shakiness) are similar to those of excitement. Labeling these feelings as "excitement" rather than "nervousness" can lead to relaxation and better communication [01:14:02].
*   **Positive Self-Talk:** Counter negative internal chatter by using a simple mantra, such as "I have value to add" or "You've got this" [01:16:30].

### The Importance of Structure
Human brains are wired for logical connections and stories, not lists [00:37:13]. Using structures for spontaneous communication:
*   Reduces the burden of thinking about *what* to say and *how* to say it simultaneously [00:37:52].
*   Makes communication more digestible and memorable for the audience [00:39:45].
*   Examples of useful structures include:
    *   **Problem-Solution-Benefit:** Common in advertising, and applicable to many situations [00:37:33].
    *   **PREP (Point, Reason, Example, Point again):** Useful for making a clear, concise point [00:38:40].

### Practice and Reflection
To improve communication skills, consistent practice is essential.
*   **Repetition:** Regularly apply structures and techniques [00:41:42].
*   **Reflection:** Think about what worked and what didn't after a communication event [00:41:46].
*   **Feedback:** Seek input from others, as we are not always the best judges of our own communication [00:41:50].

### Resources for Practice
*   **Toastmasters:** A wonderful organization that provides opportunities for practice and feedback, including on-the-spot speaking exercises (Table Topics) [00:42:00].
*   **Improvisation Classes:** Help develop presence, collaboration, and comfort in spontaneous situations [00:42:49].
*   **University Extension Programs:** Many universities offer communication classes open to the public [00:43:11].
*   **"Try This" Exercises:** Actively engage with advice from books or podcasts by practicing the techniques [00:44:00].

Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe, has extensive experience in [[Leadership and management challenges in scaling a company | leading and scaling design teams]] at hypergrowth companies like Airbnb, Lyft, and Stripe, where she has seen teams scale at least 10x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14]</a>. Her insights cover overcoming leadership challenges, operationalizing quality, fostering collaboration, and driving growth through design.

## Early Leadership Lessons: The Airbnb Intervention

Upon joining Airbnb as Head of Experience Design (product design) with a team of 10 people, Katie inherited an organization with low engagement scores and friction in collaboration with engineering and product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57]</a>. Approaching the role "swinging" to make changes, she soon faced an "intervention" from half her design team and an HR partner, who presented a list of her perceived shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21]</a>.

This difficult experience became the biggest learning moment of her leadership career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22]</a>. The core issue was a lack of trust: she wasn't bringing the team along and they didn't believe she had their best interests or shared goals at heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01]</a>. Katie's immediate shift to listening and understanding individual and team motivations led to the design team achieving the best engagement scores in the company within a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16]</a>. The key takeaway: for leaders, "come in listening" instead of "coming in swinging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30]</a>.

## Core Principles for Team Performance

Katie uses a formula to think about improving team performance:
> **Performance = Potential - Interference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05]</a>

This framework highlights two main levers for leaders:
1.  **Increasing Potential**: Achieved by hiring well, developing talent, and helping individuals grow their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37]</a>.
2.  **Decreasing Interference**: Removing obstacles that hold talented individuals back from doing great work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50]</a>. These interferences can lead to burnout and reduce success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06]</a>.

The "design" of a team is never truly "done" as companies grow, processes must constantly adjust to new people and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27]</a>.

## Fostering Collaboration and Alignment

A key strategy is to promote [[Building a successful product management team | multi-disciplinary teams]] working closely together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13]</a>. Designers should have a dual identity: belonging to their core design community *and* their cross-functional product team (e.g., Marketplace team) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37]</a>.

### Removing Physical Interference: The Lyft Example

At Lyft, Katie encountered a similar situation to early Airbnb: the design team was physically separated from engineering and product by a locked door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. While this created a safe space for creative discovery, it led to wasted work, misalignment, and slower processes because product managers and engineers were making decisions without designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.

To reduce this interference, the physical barrier was broken down, and design, engineering, and product teams were co-located and structurally aligned by product area (e.g., Driver, Rider, Safety teams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. They maintained dedicated creative spaces for critiques and working sessions, ensuring the best of both worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This led to faster iteration cycles and better clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

### Increasing Awareness: The Shared Deck

To combat the loss of awareness across a growing organization, Katie implemented a shared deck system:
*   Designers regularly share screenshots or prototypes of their work in a Google Slide deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
*   This allows designers to see what others are working on, identify overlaps, and discover reusable patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   The deck is also sent to product managers, engineering leaders, and company leaders to provide a clear visual overview of ongoing development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   The frequency is experimented with (currently monthly at Stripe) to ensure it's low-maintenance and doesn't become an arduous task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   Crucially, this "opens up the curtain" to work in progress, preventing redundant efforts and collisions by identifying issues earlier in the project lifecycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Prioritizing Quality and Beauty in Product Development

Katie emphasizes that "quality is growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47]</a>. While functionality is crucial, beauty enhances functionality by making products easier to use, more approachable, and more compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22]</a>. Beautiful products increase trust, signaling meticulous attention to detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43]</a>.

### Operationalizing Quality: Walk the Store

To ensure consistent quality, especially as product areas become siloed, Stripe implemented a "Walk the Store" process:
*   **Journey Identification**: 15 critical user journeys are selected as essential to get right at the highest level of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   **Ownership**: Each journey has dedicated engineering, product, and design leaders responsible for its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Regular Review**: These leaders regularly "walk the store" by putting themselves in the user's shoes and experiencing the end-to-end journey (e.g., from search, to website, to docs, to dashboard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   **Friction Logging**: They meticulously log frictions and issues encountered, filing bugs and reaching out to relevant teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Scoring**: Each journey is scored based on a rubric assessing usability, utility, desirability, and whether it reaches a "surprisingly great" level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. A color-based system (e.g., yellow, yellow-green) is preferred over numerical scores to encourage qualitative judgment over hyper-focus on specific numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
*   **Calibration (PQR)**: Quarterly, leaders meet for "Product Quality Review" (PQR) to calibrate scores and discuss findings, fostering a shared understanding of the quality bar across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. This process fosters empathy for users and surfaces opportunities for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

### ROI of Design and Quality

Quality improvements directly impact business metrics. For example:
*   **Onboarding Flows**: Improving the onboarding experience at Stripe led to increased activations because products were easier to understand and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Checkout Experience**: Fixing errors and improving the quality of Stripe's checkout experience (used by companies like Amazon, Shopify, Spotify, X) resulted in a 10.5% increase in business revenue for customers switching to the newer checkout form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **Support Cases**: Addressing usability issues (e.g., a confusing button on an invoice) can decrease the need for users to contact support, directly improving the bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

Companies should proactively identify and communicate examples of how quality leads to better business outcomes to their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Fighting the Fear of Bold Ideas

There's a tendency in companies, regardless of size, to favor incremental approaches over bold, big ideas because they are harder to measure and feel safer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. However, a focus on incrementalism within narrow scopes can prevent the entire product experience from becoming better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

Katie advocates for "reaching for the stars and landing on the moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>:
*   **Vision Work**: Developing a comprehensive vision of the ideal "11-star experience" across the entire user journey is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.
*   **North Star**: This "North Star" vision (like architectural plans for a house) provides a clear target to work back from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.
*   **Phased Execution**: While the vision is grand, execution can be phased. Ship smaller pieces first to study and learn, then move to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>. This allows for measured, thoughtful risk-taking.

## Hiring Designers

When hiring designers, particularly for non-designers, Katie recommends focusing on:
1.  **Taste and Judgment**: It's easier to teach tools and process than it is taste and character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. Look for a natural inclination towards great things.
2.  **Humility**: Essential for teamwork, respect, empathy, and understanding users. Humble designers are more curious about what's working/not working and strive to navigate improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>.
3.  **Hustle/Hutzpah**: The courage to propose new solutions from a blank slate, and the resolve to say "this isn't good enough" and try again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:39">[01:12:39]</a>. This "fight for great" is vital for execution.

For younger companies or startups, while a "doer" is often needed, it's also important to bring in a senior leader or advisor who can help build a user-focused organization and define a strategy from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>.

## Design as Intention

At its core, design is intentionality – bringing careful thought to decisions by considering who is impacted and who is using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This applies to anything from a doorknob to organizational structure or product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. While design expertise brings creative skills and great taste, anyone can bring more care and intentionality to their work, leading to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

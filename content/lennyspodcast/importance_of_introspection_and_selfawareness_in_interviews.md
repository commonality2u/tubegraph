Many successful professionals prioritize [[the_role_of_personal_growth_and_selfawareness_for_founders | self-awareness]] and introspection when evaluating candidates. These qualities reveal a candidate's ability to reflect on their experiences, understand their motivations, and learn from both successes and failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

This question is designed to break the typical interview mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a> and elicit a genuinely [[the_importance_of_authenticity_and_curiosity_in_leadership | authentic]] and opinionated response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

### Introspection on Decisions (IO Omalo)

Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, seeks to understand what candidates have learned about themselves that reveals their limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This tests their introspection and whether they can be open about struggles rather than blaming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

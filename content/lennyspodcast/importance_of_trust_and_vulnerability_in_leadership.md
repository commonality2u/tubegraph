At Whiz, the company culture emphasizes trust and psychological safety, which is crucial for its rapid growth and innovation. This environment allows employees to be vulnerable, fostering better decision-making and stronger relationships within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

## Fostering a Culture of Openness
When Ros Herberg joined Whiz as the first product manager, she was one of the first 10 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The founders initially did not have a clear product idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Despite sitting in on 10 to 15 meetings daily with potential customers, Ros, as the product manager responsible for building the product, still didn't understand what they were going to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

It was confusing for her, as she was supposed to start building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. At some point, she felt compelled to ask what exactly they were doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Ros recalled feeling sure she was the only one who didn't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>, and it was hard to find the courage to admit her lack of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. However, this question led to a deep discussion and ultimately a pivot to Cloud security, where things started to click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

> "I still did not exactly understand what we were going to build which was confusing because I was a product manager so I was supposed to start building it and so at some point I was kind of like I have to ask what exactly are we doing here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

This experience highlighted the [[leadership_principles_and_skills | importance of a culture]] where it's not shameful to admit "I don't understand" or ask for explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Whiz, being a flat organization, fosters an environment where impact is prioritized over seniority, and all voices are heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The founding team's willingness to listen and adapt, even to an employee's honest admission of confusion, speaks volumes about their culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Ros views "I don't understand" as her favorite question, believing that if something isn't easy to understand, it needs more thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

## Building Trust and Connection
The role of a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), which Ros later transitioned into at Whiz, requires immense trust and a deep connection with the founding team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. Marketing efforts are highly visible and directly represent the company to the world, making trust easy to break with missteps like a "bad ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

For a company like Whiz, operating in a highly technical market like cloud security, it's very challenging for someone without a deep understanding of the product and market to succeed in a CMO role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. Ros's background in engineering and product, and her deep knowledge of the security domain, allowed her to build this trust organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. She focused on the problem and audience she knew well, enabling her to take chances and "make a lot of noise" through unconventional marketing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.

The Whiz founding team, with 20-22 years of working together, shares complete trust and clear domains, which facilitates rapid decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. This deep-seated trust extends to their employees, as they are willing to give opportunities and trust to individuals regardless of their title or prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. This approach fosters employee loyalty and a sense of shared ownership in what is being built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.

## Embracing Vulnerability and Failure
Ros's career progression, including joining Whiz and moving into marketing, was driven by following good people rather than a strict plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. She admits she often felt she would fail, especially when taking on new roles, but still chose to attempt them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This comfort with the possibility of [[managing_failure_and_rebuilding_trust | failure]] is a learned quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

Her upbringing, influenced by her mother's belief that "friction is good," taught her to push beyond areas of existing confidence and into those where she felt less secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>. This mindset, prioritizing hard work and friction over natural talent, allowed her to grow and take risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

> "I just know that I'm kind of okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail at something and still attempting it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>

Ros shares a [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | contrarian opinion]] on imposter syndrome: rather than trying to build confidence, she suggests embracing the feeling of being an imposter and letting it not stop you from making decisions or attempting new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. She argues that you will never know your limit if you don't try, even if you think you might fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>. In a new role, you likely are an imposter, and that's perfectly normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>.

In the realm of product [[importance_of_product_positioning | positioning]], understanding competitive alternatives is the crucial first step to defining how a product is the best in the world at delivering specific value to a well-defined set of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This concept dictates what a company must "beat" to win a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

## Defining Competitive Alternatives

Competitive alternatives are not just direct competitors that look exactly like your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. In B2B, there are typically two sets of competitors:

1.  **Status Quo** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>: This refers to whatever a company is currently doing to try and solve a problem, even if the existing solution is inefficient or subpar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
2.  **Shortlisted Alternatives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>: If a company decides to purchase a new solution, they typically create a shortlist of other products or services they are considering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

A company must be able to "beat" both the status quo and any shortlisted alternatives to win a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

## The Pitfall of "No Decision"

Many companies make the mistake of discounting the status quo as a competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. However, in B2B, approximately 40% of deals are lost to "no decision," which often means the customer opted to stick with their current, often manual, methods like spreadsheets, pen and paper, or even interns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. If a product's [[importance_of_product_positioning | positioning]] doesn't effectively demonstrate why a customer should abandon their current way of doing things, they will never make the switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

## Starting with Alternatives to Find Differentiation

The easiest way to identify what makes a product different is to first understand what it needs to position against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This involves identifying the product's differentiated capabilitiesâ€”features, functions, or company capabilities (like pricing or professional services) that alternatives do not possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.

By mapping these unique capabilities to the value they enable for the customer ("so what?" for the customer), a company can identify core value themes that are truly differentiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. This ensures that the identified value is not just generally valuable, but specifically unique to the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

## The Customer's Buying Journey and Justification

Customers, particularly in B2B, face an overwhelming amount of information when seeking new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. They need to justify their choice to their superiors and internal stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. Effective [[importance_of_product_positioning | positioning]] helps the customer understand:

*   How the market is segmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.
*   Which solutions are best for different types of needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.
*   Why a specific product is the ideal choice for their particular situation, based on its unique value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

Without this clarity, customers may default to a "no decision" because they cannot confidently justify a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

## Arming the Champion

In B2B sales, a crucial role is played by the "champion" within the target company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. This individual is responsible for building consensus and championing the deal across various stakeholders, including the economic buyer (the person who writes the check) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

Effective [[importance_of_product_positioning | positioning]] must first and foremost resonate with this champion, as they are often the gatekeeper for getting onto a shortlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. Once the champion is convinced, the next step in the [[role_of_positioning_in_sales_and_marketing | sales process]] is to equip them with the narrative and arguments needed to sell the solution internally to other constituents like IT, purchasing, or end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.

By deeply understanding competitive alternatives and the unique value a product provides, a company can create a compelling sales narrative that empowers its champions and significantly increases its chances of winning deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

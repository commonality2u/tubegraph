Developing and sustaining a company's culture is an evolving process, particularly as an organization grows. At HubSpot, co-founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah highlights that culture isn't a static entity to be preserved, but rather a dynamic "product" that must be continuously iterated upon and refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a>.

## Defining Culture

The concept of "culture" was first introduced at HubSpot by co-founder Brian Halligan, who, after a CEO group meeting, told Dharmesh, "Oh, Dares, I hear this culture thing is really important, by the way, can you go do that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>. At this point, the word "culture" had never been mentioned at HubSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>. Dharmesh initially felt he was "the worst possible person" for the task, as he "doesn't like being around people a whole lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.

Dharmesh's approach to defining culture was to articulate the existing culture, rather than create a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. He posed the question: "If I could write a Python function that would measure the probability of success of a new person coming into HubSpot, what would the factors be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

## Culture as a Product

A core realization for Dharmesh was that [[Building and maintaining company culture | culture is a product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>. He explains that every company builds two products:
1.  The product for their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>.
2.  The product for their team (culture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>.

This perspective implies several key principles:
*   **Customer Feedback:** Just as product teams talk to customers, culture builders must talk to their "customers"â€”the employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. HubSpot regularly conducts NPS surveys for its "culture product," publishing all responses (excluding sender identity) and categorizing them into "bugs" to be fixed or features that "work as designed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a>.
*   **Iteration:** Culture should never be considered "done" or merely "preserved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>. The needs of customers and employees change as the company scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>, requiring continuous iteration just like a software product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>.
*   **Transparency:** Applying [[Governance and values in building companies | transparency]] as a core principle to culture means openly sharing survey results and addressing feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.

## Key Principles and Manifestations

### Simplicity

Dharmesh believes that all leaders and businesses are constantly fighting the second law of thermodynamics, which states that "over time, unless you intervene, everything goes to crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. In a company context, this means complexity increases, leading to slower operations and eventual stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.

[[Building and maintaining company culture | HubSpot's culture]] includes a principle to "fight for simplicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. This means:
*   **Conscious Effort:** Simplicity is worth fighting for because it does not happen naturally; the universe, and even well-intentioned people, will introduce complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Product Decisions:** In early years, HubSpot implemented a rule that for every "knob or dial" (feature) added to the product, one had to be removed, ensuring a net zero increase in features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. This forces consideration of the long-term cost of complexity beyond initial implementation or maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. Adding a new product, for example, creates "dimensional complexity" affecting every subsequent decision and metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>.
*   **Early Constraints:** Dharmesh attributes HubSpot's ability to maintain simplicity partly to early self-imposed constraints, such as targeting the SMB market and offering a freemium product, which inherently limit the amount of complexity that can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

### Transparency

Transparency has been a core value at HubSpot since its early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. Initially, all information within HubSpot was equally shared with everyone, with two exceptions: illegal information and co-owned information like salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

When HubSpot went public, legal and banking advisors assumed a small group of "designated insiders" would have access to financials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. Through a process of "mathematical induction," Dharmesh and Brian discovered there was no legal limit to the number of insiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. On the day they went public, every single employee was designated an insider, allowing them to maintain full transparency of financials even at 7,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

### Autonomy and Decision-Making

HubSpot believes in autonomy, reflected in its lack of mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>. To facilitate communication while respecting autonomy, Dharmesh created "flash tags" (e.g., #FYI, #suggestion, #recommendation, #plea) to indicate the level of conviction behind a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>. Even a "#plea" is not a mandate, upholding the principle of trusting employees to make hard decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

When making decisions, HubSpot employs a "debate, decide, unite" framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. This is a softer version of Amazon's "disagree and commit," emphasizing open debate, a clear decision-maker (a Directly Responsible Individual or DRI), and then collective unity behind the chosen path, even for those who initially disagreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>.

### Leaning into Strengths

Dharmesh made the decision early on not to have any direct reports at HubSpot, a practice he has maintained for 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This stems from his belief in leaning into strengths and avoiding things one is not "exceptionally world-class" at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He recognized he "sucked at management" and didn't want to spend years becoming "passively okay" at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This decision allowed him to leverage the upsides of scale without the downsides of managing people, keeping him engaged and happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

This also influenced other unique cultural aspects:
*   **Meeting schedules:** Both co-founders being "night people" led to a rule of "no meetings before 11:00 a.m. period" in the early years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
*   **Flat salaries:** For the first year and a half, everyone, including founders, received a flat salary of $5,000 per month, emphasizing simplicity and avoiding salary-related politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
*   **Office seating:** Initial office seating was determined by lottery to avoid politics and reinforce a flat organization, evolving to a quarterly, slightly optimized lottery for hundreds of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

## Evolution and Challenges

While Dharmesh views [[Building and maintaining company culture | culture as a product]] that evolves, some core values remain constant, similar to a product's unchanging core values (e.g., building for SMB, ease of use) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>.

*   **Federal vs. State Law:** HubSpot distinguishes between "federal laws" (core company-wide values like transparency) and "state laws" (group-specific optimizations, like support teams needing set hours despite the company's general disregard for hours worked) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>.
*   **Aspirational vs. True Culture:** The original "Culture Code" deck included aspirational points that weren't entirely true at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:18">[01:29:18]</a>. Dharmesh purposefully left them in, calling them out in "liner notes," as he observed that over time, these aspirations became increasingly true as new hires adopted them as the desired culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>.

<div class="callout">
[!example] The Culture Code Deck
The initial 16-slide "Culture Code" deck was Dharmesh's attempt to articulate HubSpot's culture by defining the attributes sought in successful new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. The name "Culture Code" came from the idea that if he could write code to define HubSpot's culture, this is what it would look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>. The deck was initially met with negative feedback, as employees feared it would lead to a "fake" or "inauthentic" culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>. However, it went on to become a widely influential document in the startup world.

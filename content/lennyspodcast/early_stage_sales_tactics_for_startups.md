This article provides [[Tactical Advice for EarlyStage Founders | tactical advice]] for [[Founderled sales strategies | founder-led sales]] in early stage startups, focusing on how to approach sales conversations, find leads, and close deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It addresses common challenges faced by [[Earlystage startup challenges and solutions | early stage Founders]] who might be tripped up by advice intended for later-stage sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The insights are shared by **Jen AEL**, co-founder of Jellyfish, who helps early stage founders with sales, [[Finding productmarket fit in startups | early customer discovery]], and setting up repeatable sales motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

## The Importance of [[Founderled sales strategies | Founder-Led Sales]]
[[Founderled sales strategies | Founder-led sales]] is the first commercial milestone for a startup, focusing on acquiring the initial few customers, often described as going from "zero to one" or securing the first 10 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. It is crucial in the early days when there is limited brand equity, marketing, or customer references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

### Why the Founder is the "Product"
In the absence of a fully developed product, the founder serves as the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This is because:
*   **Subject Matter Expertise**: The founder is a subject matter expert with a novel insight that the market hasn't yet seen or visualized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This unique perspective excites the market even before the product is shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   **Visionary Leadership**: No one can articulate the vision like the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   **Highest Authority**: The market is often eager to engage with a founder due to their position at the top of the startup's hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   **Discovery of Insights**: Founders can identify "budding moments" in conversations that a salesperson might miss, which are crucial for refining the go-to-market strategy and reaching [[Finding productmarket fit in startups | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

[[Founderled sales strategies | Founder-led sales]] is about aligning the founder's vision with market reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. It is a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

> "[[Founderled sales strategies | Founder-led sales]] is not about revenue on day one; it is about learning as fast as humanly possible to get to that pulse so that you can earn the right to sell." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>

Founders should continue [[Founderled sales strategies | founder-led sales]] until reaching around \$500K to \$1 million in ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. It's often recommended not to hire salespeople until Series A, as the seed stage is for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

## The Sales Cycle: Key Steps

The traditional sales stages often align with CRM setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>:
1.  **Intro Call**: Initial contact to gauge interest.
2.  **Second Call (Demo)**: Potentially includes a product demonstration.
3.  **Third Call**: Discussing proposals, scope of work, and deeper context of the demo.
4.  **Fourth Call**: Co-authoring the scope of work and gathering feedback.
5.  **Introduction to Procurement**: Engaging with professional buyers.
6.  **Post-Procurement (Signature)**: Securing the final contract signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

The buyer's existing process can also dictate the sales steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. However, for startups turning non-consumers into consumers, the outlined steps generally apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

### 1. Getting Initial Attention (Cold Outreach)

The biggest challenge is often getting someone to even talk to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

*   **Founder's Advantage**: Outreach from a founder carries more weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.
*   **Lead with Novel Insight**: The technical or business model insight should lead the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. People are inspired by new, counterintuitive, or different ways of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. Avoid saying "we're better" as it's hard to define <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>.
*   **Key Messaging Components**:
    1.  **Relevancy**: Why is this relevant to the recipient's role? This is more important than deep personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.
    2.  **Differentiation/Counterintuitive**: Say something that makes them pause, like "what?" or "I've never thought about it that way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.
    3.  **Concise**: Keep it to 3-4 sentences maximum so it can be read on a mobile phone without scrolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. This style also reflects how executives write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.
    4.  **Problem-focused**: Talk about the problem you want to solve, not the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[29:16:00]</a>. Leave them wanting more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.
*   **Channels**: Cold email, LinkedIn DMs, and even cold calling can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>.
*   **Conversion Rates**: A healthy conversion rate for outbound is around 5-7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>, but can be 8-15% if it's from the founder solving a difficult problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>. The *interest rate* is highly dependent on the problem the founder is solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>. If a problem is genuinely felt by the market, people will respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>.

### Finding Leads
Before relying on tools, manually identify 30 people you are genuinely excited to learn from and are willing to spend 15-20 minutes writing a thoughtful, personalized note to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>. This exercise helps:
*   **Test Discoverability**: Are these people even easy to find? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>
*   **Identify Commonalities**: Look for patterns (e.g., team size, industry, role tenure, previous roles) that can define your target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>.
*   **Natural Experiments**: If outreach yields zero responses, it forces you to adjust messaging or target a different role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:00">[25:17:00]</a>.
*   **Inform Tools**: Once parameters are known, tools like Clay can be effectively used for enrichment and building campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:00">[26:10:00]</a>.

### 2. The First Sales Call
*   **Be Vulnerable and Honest**: As an early stage startup, openly admit you have a lot to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
    *   Example: "Hey, I'm an early stage startup. We are deeply passionate about solving this specific problem. We have a lot to learn here. Here's how we are thinking about it from a problem priority perspective. Can we gain your insight into how this problem is manifesting on your side?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
    *   This approach makes it easier for prospects to give raw, honest feedback because they don't feel like they're criticizing a "fully baked" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Demos on the First Call**: The demo is a valuable "carrot" you control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:37:00">[49:37:00]</a>. Save it for a second call to keep prospects engaged and invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:57:00">[49:57:00]</a>.
    *   *Exception*: For low-ACV (Annual Contract Value) tools (\$3,000 range) or high-volume sales, demoing quickly is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:20:00">[50:20:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Problem Discovery**: Ask questions that reveal "aha moments" for the prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a>. Encourage them to visualize the problem and potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:00">[39:00:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Clich√©d Questions**: Do not ask "what keeps you up at night?" or "what are your pain points today?" as answers change daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:06:00">[42:06:00]</a>.
*   **Book the Next Call**: Always aim to book the next meeting on the current call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>. If they suggest emailing later, it's often a polite rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:37:00">[42:37:00]</a>.

### Signs of [[Finding productmarket fit in startups | Product-Market Fit]] (During Sales Calls)
Pay attention to these signals that indicate a big enough pain point and potential for [[Finding productmarket fit in startups | product-market fit]]:
*   **Growing/Widening Problem**: The problem should be significant and evolving, not fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07:00">[40:07:00]</a>.
*   **Measurement/Management**: Ask if they are currently measuring or managing this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:00">[40:24:00]</a>. A "no" indicates low priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:30:00">[40:30:00]</a>.
*   **Past Solutions**: Inquire how they've tried to solve it (e.g., hiring, other tools, or if it remains an open gap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:43:00">[40:43:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Momentum**: The strongest signal is when they pull in other colleagues (potential users or their boss) to discuss the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16:00">[41:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:44:00">[41:44:00]</a>. This indicates they are actively trying to solve the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>.

### 3. Co-authoring the Scope of Work & Service-Based Revenue
*   **Power of Specificity**: Early on, customers get excited if the solution feels custom-built for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:21:00">[43:21:00]</a>.
*   **Co-authorship**: Involve the customer in co-authoring the scope of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37:00">[43:37:00]</a>. This reveals their "buyer maturity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:46:00">[43:46:00]</a>.
*   **Service Contracts**: If a company lacks an existing process or strategy to solve a problem, they aren't ready to buy technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a>. In these cases, sell a service first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:58:00">[43:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Benefits of Service Contracts**:
        *   **Education**: Get paid to educate them and design their process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:45:00">[44:45:00]</a>.
        *   **Logo/Revenue**: Secure the customer's logo and initial revenue (showing intent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:00">[44:06:00]</a>.
        *   **Market Insights**: Gain deeper context on their business.
        *   **Mindset Setting**: Set the stage for how the buyer thinks about your future technology solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01:00">[45:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Time Boxing**: Time-box service contracts to 90-day increments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:08:00">[45:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Example Services**: Helping them craft a custom pitch for their boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:56:00">[47:56:00]</a>, or assisting with designing a deployment/integration process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:22:00">[48:22:00]</a>. This is essentially consulting them towards product acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>.
*   **Prevalence**: 40-50% of B2B SaaS companies, especially those in top-down sales where the user and buyer are different, need to sell some form of service before technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:26:00">[47:26:00]</a>.

### 4. Navigating Procurement
Procurement teams are professional, highly educated buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:23:00">[51:23:00]</a>.
*   **Simplify Your Pitch**: Make your offering clear and easy to understand, avoiding jargon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:39:00">[51:39:00]</a>.
*   **Differentiate Clearly**: Your solution must feel *different*, not just "better," to avoid being routed to existing preferred vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50:00">[51:50:00]</a>.
*   **Do the Work**: Make their job easy. Offer to fill out forms and complete necessary documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:24:00">[52:24:00]</a>.
*   **Clarity on Scope**: Clearly explain what you do and don't do. If procurement cannot classify you, they will default to classifying you as "high risk," leading to complex, lengthy contracts (MSAs, high insurance policies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:57:00">[52:57:00]</a>.
*   **Truncate Contracts**: Consider offering a technology contract and a service contract separately. A service contract can get you onboarded faster, educate users, and create an incentive for the technology piece to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:50:00">[53:50:00]</a>.

### 5. Getting the Signature
*   **Identify the Signatory**: Before the final stage, know who the actual signatory is (CFO, legal, business unit head, head of procurement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:25:00">[58:25:00]</a>.
*   **Prep the Signatory**: Provide the procurement lead with key bullets that explain what the signatory is signing and why it's important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:40:00">[58:40:00]</a>. Not doing so can cause significant delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:19:00">[59:19:00]</a>.
*   **No Payment Without Approval**: Do not start any work until finance and procurement have approved and signed the contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.

### Discounting
Discounting should have a clear reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. Avoid discounting just to close a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>.
*   **SMB**: For small businesses, a small buffer for discounting may be acceptable as it's often their own money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>.
*   **Mid-Market/Enterprise**: There must be a specific reason for a discount, such as the customer acting as a design partner, offering a two-year reference, or providing other value beyond just using the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>.

## Sales Cycle Timelines
*   **Project Management**: How well the founder project manages the sales cycle (e.g., scheduling calls tightly) directly impacts its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.
*   **Industry Regulation**: Highly regulated industries can extend sales cycles by 20-30%, potentially taking 9-12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.
*   **Problem Pain & Seniority**: The more painful the problem and the more senior the contact, the faster a deal can move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>.
*   **Typical Enterprise Deals**: Usually take 6-12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>, though rare cases can close in 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.
*   **Enterprise Value**: The effort to navigate an enterprise's system is often more expensive than the technology itself, justifying higher ACVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>. Initial ACV for early stage founders in enterprise sales should aim for \$50K-\$200K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

## Enterprise vs. Small Business (SMB) Sales
*   **Enterprise (500+ employees)**:
    *   **User vs. Buyer**: Different people, requiring navigation of multiple stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.
    *   **Process**: Longer, more complex due to procurement, legal, and internal due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Once "in," you become a preferred vendor, gaining a competitive moat, access to internal conversations, and potential for significant compounded growth (e.g., \$100K deal to \$500K next year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>.
*   **Small Business (SMB)**:
    *   **User & Buyer Same**: Sales process is more streamlined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>.
    *   **Challenge**: Higher churn rate if the product doesn't meet expectations, and higher business failure rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.
    *   **Go-to-Market**: Marketing-intensive, high-velocity, high-volume game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>.
*   **Mid-Market**: A "funky place" to start, as it straddles two very different go-to-market strategies (high value vs. high volume) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. If heavy integration is required, mid-market companies often lack internal resources, relying on third-party consultants, which adds complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.

The choice between focusing on SMB or Enterprise depends on where the problem is most acutely felt and which "go-to-market game" the founder wants to play, considering it will be their life for the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.

## Common Sales Pitfalls
*   **Misdiagnosis**: Founders often believe they have a "bottom of funnel" problem, but it's almost always a "top of funnel" problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>.
*   **Poor Qualification**: Spending time on the wrong leads due to not qualifying them properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>. This is the biggest opportunity for unlock in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>.
*   **Wrong Messaging**: Using ineffective or generic messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>.
*   **Not Solving the Right Problem**: The product not genuinely addressing a widely felt need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.
*   **Lack of Differentiation**: Not being different enough in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>.

## Overcoming Sales Aversion
Many founders, especially those from product or design backgrounds, feel uncomfortable with sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.
*   **Believe in Your Product**: It's difficult to sell something you don't believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>.
*   **Honesty & Trust**: Be honest about whether your solution *truly* solves their problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>. Avoid "short-selling" just for a logo, as it leads to churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.
*   **Build Trust**: Trust is the number one currency in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. If you build trust, people will recommend you and send you leads through word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.
*   **Bring Energy**: Many sales conversations are boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>. Bring passion and energy; it's felt by the market and can be invigorating for prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.

**Jen AEL's** company, Jellyfish, works directly with founders, embedding alongside the team to drive execution and ensure founders are directly engaging with the market to learn firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. This approach avoids outsourcing the "heartbeat of the organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>.

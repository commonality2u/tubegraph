Asking for help is a transformative, yet often resisted, aspect of [[career_development_and_advice | career development]] and job searching. Phil Terry, author of "Never Search Alone," emphasizes that seeking support can dramatically change one's career trajectory, turning anxiety into confidence and opening up new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Job Search Councils: A Foundation of Support

Phil Terry advocates for "Job Search Councils" as a core component of his methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:43">[02:52:43]</a>. These councils are support groups of six to eight job seekers who commit to supporting each other through the job search process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:40">[02:57:40]</a>.

> [!info] Key Features of Job Search Councils
> *   **Support Group:** Consists of 6-8 job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:40">[02:57:40]</a>.
> *   **Commitment:** Members commit to supporting each other throughout the job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.
> *   **Methodology:** Follows a structured methodology to help members figure out their candidate market fit and "play to win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:52">[03:14:52]</a>.
> *   **Community:** Over 2,000 councils have been launched, entirely free and volunteer-driven, providing tools, training, and a Slack community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:01">[09:15:01]</a>.
> *   **Emotional Support:** Group interaction helps flip anxiety and fear into hope, motivation, accountability, and [[navigating_career_transitions_and_selfconfidence | confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:50">[04:09:50]</a>.

Phil Terry stresses that everyone, regardless of their professional level, feels insecure and anxious during a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:04">[03:47:04]</a>. Doing it alone magnifies these feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:50">[03:52:50]</a>. Job Search Councils provide a safe, vulnerable environment where people can be open and ask for help, turning negative emotions into positive drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:53">[04:03:53]</a>. This concept dates back to his mother, who formed a council of teachers in 1960 that met for 50 years to support each other's [[career_development_and_planning | careers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:16">[05:02:16]</a>.

## The Counterintuitive Nature of Asking for Help

Many people hesitate to ask for help, viewing it as a weakness, a burden, or something that could damage their reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>. However, Phil Terry presents four counterintuitive rules:

1.  **Not a Sign of Weakness, but Confidence:** Asking for help requires and strengthens [[navigating_career_transitions_and_selfconfidence | confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>.
2.  **Giving, Not Taking:** If done well, asking for help can be a giving activity, as people feel honored and excited to share their expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.
3.  **Increases Independence:** Paradoxically, asking for help makes you more independent and accountable in your search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:34">[01:16:34]</a>.
4.  **Improves Reputation:** Rather than hurting your reputation, it enhances it by showing thoughtfulness and a desire to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>.

Leaders like Brad Smith (former CEO of Intuit) and Ken Chenault (former CEO and Chairman of American Express) credit asking for help as crucial to their [[career_growth_and_personal_development | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>. Research suggests 85% of people in senior roles credit asking for help, while 85% in junior roles are afraid to ask due to perceived weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Practical Ways to Ask for Help

Asking for help can take many forms:

*   **Listening Tours:** Share your "Manukau two-pager" (what you want/don't want in a job) with trusted friends, colleagues, and recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:53">[02:40:53]</a>. Ask the "golden question": "If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a>. This provides market insights and turns your network into "listening posts" invested in your success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:56">[02:29:56]</a>.
*   **Engaging Recruiters:** Instead of directly asking for a job, seek their advice on your candidate market fit. Building relationships with recruiters *before* you need a job is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:17">[02:46:17]</a>.
*   **Seeking Feedback:** Ask colleagues to review important communications like emails, especially if you have a history of them not being well-received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>.
*   **Peer Coaching Calls:**
    *   **First 90 Days Call:** When starting a new job, talk to others in similar roles to gain insights, avoid mistakes, and plan your initial period (30/60/90 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>.
    *   **[[career_development_and_progression_strategies | Career Evolution]] Call:** If you're a director aiming for a VP role, talk to VPs to understand the path from A to B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>.
*   **Learning from Superiors:** Engage with leaders and mentors, not just for direct questions, but to understand their perspectives and thought processes. Sundar Pichai (Google CEO) served as an informal mentor to Bradley Horowitz, offering insights into Google's culture and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>.
*   **Debriefing Interviews:** Immediately after interviews, debrief with someone (ideally your job search council) to objectively assess what happened, combating impostor syndrome or misinterpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.

## Benefits of Asking for Help in Your Career

Asking for help strategically yields numerous benefits:

*   **Builds Trust:** Openness and vulnerability in asking for help foster [[building_trust_and_its_impact_on_career_growth | trust]] within your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.
*   **Increases [[navigating_career_transitions_and_selfconfidence | Confidence]]:** Understanding that anxiety in job searching is universal and that you're not alone helps build inner [[navigating_career_transitions_and_selfconfidence | confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21">[01:30:21]</a>. The "Gratitude House" exercise, reflecting on those who've helped you, can boost [[navigating_career_transitions_and_selfconfidence | confidence]] during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.
*   **Career Advancement:** Asking for help is strongly correlated with [[career_growth_and_personal_development | career growth]] and reaching senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>.
*   **Avoids Stagnation:** Seeking advice helps you adapt to market changes, refine your focus, and avoid getting "stuck" in unfulfilling jobs or roles that limit [[career_growth_and_personal_development | personal development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>.
*   **Improved Outcomes:** In negotiations, asking for resources to succeed (e.g., budget for technical debt or training) can lead to better compensation and set you up for success in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. Companies often appreciate candidates who are proactive and focused on delivering results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.
*   **Normalizes Vulnerability:** This approach helps normalize emotions and mental well-being in professional settings, fostering a more supportive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.

## How to Ask for Help Effectively

To ask for help effectively:

*   **Do Your Homework:** Don't ask people to do the work for you; show you've put in effort and are seeking advice or perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>.
*   **Be Open and Vulnerable:** Share your genuine challenges and questions, especially in a safe environment like a Job Search Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
*   **Be Honest:** Clearly state what you're asking for. Don't hide your request behind false pretenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>.
*   **Consider the Relationship:** Tailor your request to your relationship with the person. A close friend or colleague might review an email, while a new acquaintance might offer broader market insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Emotions:** If you don't trust someone, don't be fully open with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>.

By embracing the power of asking for help, individuals can transform their [[career_development_and_advice | career development]] journey, gaining not only new opportunities but also a stronger sense of self and community.

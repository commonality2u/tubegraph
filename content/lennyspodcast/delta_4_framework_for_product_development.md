The Delta 4 framework is a concept developed by Kunal Shah, an entrepreneur and product leader, who also has a background in [[philosophical_approach_to_product_development | philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>. It provides a measurable way to assess a product's improvement over existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Framework
Many people suggest a product needs to be "10x better," but this isn't very measurable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. The Delta 4 framework simplifies this by suggesting that if the "product efficiency Delta" (difference) between a new product and an old solution is greater than or equal to four (on a scale of 1 to 10), then specific outcomes will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### Examples
*   **Cab Services:** Comparing an old cab service (rated a 3 for efficiency) to Uber (rated a 9), the Delta is 6, which is greater than 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
*   **Suit Purchasing:** Buying a suit online might have cool tech features, but if the efficiency of buying a suit offline is rated higher (e.g., 5 vs. 3), the Delta is less than 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Delta 4 Product
When a product's efficiency Delta is greater than or equal to four, three main things happen:
*   **Irreversible:** The user's shift to the new product becomes irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.
*   **High Tolerance for Failure:** Users develop a very high tolerance for the product to fail slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. For instance, if Uber fails a little, users typically won't stop using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   **Unique Brag-Worthy Proposition (UBP):** Humans cannot stop talking or sharing about Delta 4 products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. This means Delta 4 products naturally have lower or sometimes zero customer acquisition costs because people discover them through word-of-mouth rather than ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

Conversely, if the Delta is less than four, the product is reversible, people won't brag about it, and there's zero tolerance for its failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

## Application and Purpose
The framework is simple to apply to features, products, and even businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. It helps founders understand why their product might not be gaining traction, particularly if they believe it's "better" but the perceived efficiency difference isn't significant enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. People are busy and won't commit to a new product unless it's substantially better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.

Several venture capitalists in the US reportedly use the Delta 4 framework as part of their training programs for analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

## Philosophical Roots
The framework's genesis stems from a philosophical quest to understand what makes things successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. It is derived from studies around entropy and evolutionary biology, exploring when a species gets disrupted and the relationship between low and high entropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

Balancing work and personal life, particularly in demanding roles like a CEO, can be challenging. Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, shares his insights on how he manages to avoid burnout and maintain a fulfilling personal life while leading a global business.

## The Paradox of Deep Involvement
Brian Chesky notes a surprising paradox: the more deeply involved he became in the details of the company, the more personal time he eventually found himself having <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>. Initially, this increased involvement meant significantly more work for about one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>. However, once the company "turned the corner," everyone began to "row in the same direction," leading to fewer internal conflicts and reduced employee turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>. This shift meant he spent less time reacting to problems and intervening in dysfunctional projects, which previously added significant and unproductive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>. This approach highlights a unique perspective on [[managing_energy_versus_time | managing energy versus time]], where initial intense focus can lead to long-term efficiency and more personal freedom.

## Strategies for Avoiding Burnout
Recognizing that he was not historically a "poster child" for [[redefining_success_and_worklife_balance | work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>, Chesky developed specific practices to step away from work and avoid burnout:
*   **Scheduled Breaks** He intentionally steps away from work every other weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>, working intensely one weekend and taking the next completely off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.
*   **Physical Health** He prioritizes exercise, ensuring he never misses a workout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. This includes 20 minutes of morning cardio daily and gym workouts three or four times a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>. He also maintains a healthy diet, typically consuming five to six meals a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.
*   **Adequate Sleep** Getting a "fairly good amount of sleep" is also a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>.

## Prioritizing Relationships and Personal Growth
Chesky emphasizes that three main factors govern happiness in life: health, relationships, and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>. He found that as an entrepreneur, he had become isolated, losing touch with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>.

To combat this, he now actively cultivates healthy relationships:
*   **Maintaining Friendships** He makes a practice of staying in constant touch with friends, including high school and college friends, through group chats and regular trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. These trips, often utilizing Airbnb properties, provide "new shared experiences" rather than just reliving old stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>.
*   **Family Time** He stays with his sister when in New York City to ensure he spends time with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.
*   **Proactive Engagement** Chesky highlights the importance of being proactive rather than reactive in personal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>. In the past, his constant reactivity meant he only dealt with "incoming" messages, neglecting to reach out to those he cared about most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>. He now consciously prioritizes relationships, akin to how he prioritizes work, by deciding who he wants to spend time with rather than just responding to who reaches out to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. This shift also involves saying "no" to "fake work" – tasks that feel productive but don't genuinely move the ball forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a> – and "yes" to meaningful work and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. This approach is crucial for [[effective_time_management_for_product_managers | effective time management]].

Chesky emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and growth for leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. He cultivates a "beginner's mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>, constantly seeing the world with fresh eyes and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. He studies history and different approaches to problem-solving, like the origins of divisional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. He is "shameless about reaching out for help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>, believing that asking for assistance is an honor for others and a way to learn from those even a year ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This relentless pursuit of knowledge and willingness to evolve is central to his personal and professional [[finding_and_pursuing_life_goals | growth]] and [[creating_accountability_for_personal_growth | accountability]].

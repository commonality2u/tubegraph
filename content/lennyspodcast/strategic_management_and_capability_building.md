Roger Martin, a renowned strategy advisor and Professor Emeritus at the Rotman School of Management, emphasizes that [[becoming_more_strategic_in_a_business_context | strategic management]] is crucial for all levels of a company, not just top executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. He advocates for a practical approach to strategy, contrasting it with what he describes as flawed academic theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Why Strategy is Hard
Many people struggle with strategy due to several factors:
*   **Educational unpreparedness** Business schools often teach ineffective, overly theoretical approaches, like the resource-based view of the firm, which is rarely used in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Lack of company training** Companies do not adequately prepare employees for strategic roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Intellectual challenge** Strategy is an integrative activity, requiring multiple answers to fit together and reinforce one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional intimidation** It involves making difficult choices about what *not* to do and being accountable for those decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Defining Strategy
Martin defines strategy as "an integrated set of choices that compels desired customer action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. The core idea is to make deliberate decisions on controllable aspects of a business to influence customer behavior, encouraging them to choose your product or service over competitors' or alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## The Strategy Choice Cascade

To help organizations craft a robust strategy, Martin developed the "Strategy Choice Cascade," a framework of five interconnected questions:

1.  **What is Our Winning Aspiration?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>
    *   This question defines what the company is trying to accomplish and helps contextualize subsequent choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
    *   For example, instead of "we want to get some of a big market," a better aspiration might be "to satisfy core customers who love what we do but think it's too narrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. Strategy should compel desired customer action, so aspirations often link back to customer benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

2.  **Where Will We Play?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>
    *   This defines the specific playing field or battlefield the company will operate on, considering target customers, product types (finished product vs. component), distribution channels, and vertical stages in the value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
    *   Example: Four Seasons Hotels chose to exit real estate and construction to focus solely on luxury hotel management, a "where to play" decision that shifted its vertical stage in the value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

3.  **How Will We Win?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>
    *   This is about creating sustainable competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>. A company must either be:
        *   **Lowest Cost Provider**: Offering products or services at a significantly lower cost than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. This often requires dominant scale within a territory (e.g., Vanguard, Southwest Airlines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
        *   **Differentiated**: Providing unique value that customers highly desire, making them choose your offering over others (e.g., Lego) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.
    *   Simply "being better" is insufficient; the differentiation must be hard for competitors to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

4.  **What Capabilities Must We Have in Place to Win?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>
    *   These are the essential competencies that enable a company to execute its "how to win" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.
    *   These capabilities should be difficult for competitors to copy (i.e., a "moat") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Competitors may "can't do it" (e.g., Westlaw's century of legal case indexing) or "won't do it" (e.g., Walmart's reluctance to embrace e-commerce due to existing physical store investments, or traditional auto OEMs' hesitance with EVs due to their ICE business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.
    *   Integrated and multifaceted capabilities create stronger barriers to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

5.  **What Management Systems are Required to Make Sure the Capabilities are in Place?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>
    *   These are the structures, processes, and measures that build and maintain the necessary capabilities over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
    *   For Four Seasons, this involved a unique approach to recruiting, onboarding, and career development to achieve a low employee turnover rate and highly trained staff capable of delivering customized service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.
    *   These systems ensure that competitive advantages are sustained, even in a dynamic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.

> [!INFO] Playing to Win
> Martin co-authored the book "Playing to Win," which argues against merely "playing to play" â€“ operating without a clear, defensible strategic advantage. If customers don't perceive your offering as either differentiated or lower cost, you are "playing to play," and competitors will eventually dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

### Iteration and Betterment
Strategy is not about achieving perfection but continuous "betterment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>. Organizations should focus on identifying and solving the most painful "gaps" between desired and current outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. By consistently making different choices to close these gaps, companies can steadily improve their strategic position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. This iterative approach, likened to a professor continually refining a course based on student feedback, leads to continuous improvement over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>.

## Strategy is a Practice
Martin asserts that there is no such thing as a "great natural strategist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>. Great strategists, like former P&G CEO A.G. Lafley, become skilled through decades of dedicated practice and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. His [[advice_for_improving_strategic_thinking_in_product_managers | advice for improving strategic thinking in product managers]] and others is to embrace consistent practice in making strategic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Customer Tide
> Companies must be prepared to adapt to shifting customer preferences, as "the customer tide pulls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Resisting fundamental market shifts, even for powerful companies like Google (regarding AI search) or Microsoft (regarding mobile OS), is futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. The market will find a way to flow around obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.

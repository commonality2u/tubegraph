[[Nonlinear thinking and complex systems in business | Systems thinking]] is a framework for understanding complex phenomena by analyzing the interconnections between different components of a system. It involves conceptualizing elements as "stocks" (things that accumulate) and "flows" (movement between stocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Core Concepts
*   **Stocks**: Quantities that accumulate over time. Examples include the number of fish in a lake or the number of people fishing in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Flows**: The rates at which quantities move into or out of stocks. For instance, the number of fish decreases based on the number of people fishing, while fish also reproduce, increasing their numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

By mapping these relationships, one can understand how systems evolve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Applications in Engineering and Business

### Incident Management (Stripe Example)
At Stripe, [[design_and_innovation_in_software_development | incident management]] involved extensive analysis to understand why things weren't working and how to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. However, the team, including the speaker, initially became too focused on measurement and analysis, losing sight of actual improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This highlights a common pitfall: getting "caught up in the systems thinking model" can lead to prioritizing measurement over action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Hiring Pipeline Analysis
A practical application of [[nonlinear_thinking_and_complex_systems_in_business | systems thinking]] is modeling a hiring pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
1.  **Identify Stocks**: Potential candidates (infinite supply), sourced candidates, candidates who passed recruiter screens, candidates in later stages, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
2.  **Identify Flows**: Conversion rates between stages (e.g., sourced to actual candidates, passed recruiter screen to hiring manager screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. These flows are influenced by factors like the number of sourcers or recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

By visualizing this model, one can identify bottlenecks:
*   **Hiring managers not extending offers**: Many candidates reach the offer stage, but few convert to actual offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Offers not accepted**: Many offers extended, but few are accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Insufficient candidate input**: The pipeline isn't receiving enough initial candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

This helps pinpoint where to focus efforts to fix the hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Cautions and Best Practices
> [!WARNING] Reality is always right
> A common mistake is to assume "reality is wrong" when it conflicts with a system model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. However, your model is always wrong if it's in conflict with reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The gap between your model and reality is where learning occurs, allowing you to educate yourself and improve the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

[[Secondorder thinking and philosophical approaches in business | Systems thinking]] is a powerful way to learn, but it's crucial to remember that its primary purpose is to inform action, not just continuous measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

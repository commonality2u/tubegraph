The process of [[building_and_maintaining_company_culture_to_enhance_team_collaboration | defining and building a company's culture]] often starts with articulating what already exists within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.

## Culture as a Product
One unique perspective is to view culture as a product that a company builds for its team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:35">[01:21:35]</a>. This approach implies several key principles:

*   **Listen to your "Customers"**: Just as you wouldn't build a product without consulting customers, culture should be built by talking to its "customers"—the employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
*   **Measure and Iterate**: Regularly conduct surveys, such as Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys, for your "culture product" to gauge employee sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>. Culture should be iterated on continually, similar to how a product evolves, rather than being preserved as a fixed entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>. The needs of employees change as a company scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>.
*   **Address "Bugs" Publicly**: Feedback from employees, sometimes referred to as "bugs" in the culture, should be categorized and addressed publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>. Commit to fixing some issues while also explaining when certain aspects are "working as designed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>.

## Key Cultural Principles and Practices
### Transparency
HubSpot's culture has always valued transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>. From day one, all information within the company, including financials, was shared with every employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:06">[02:55:06]</a>. This was initially chosen for simplicity, as binary decisions (share everything or nothing) are easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>. This commitment continued even when the company went public, with every employee being designated an "insider" to maintain full access to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:41">[02:46:41]</a>.

### Simplicity
[[building_a_culture_of_excellence | Fighting for simplicity]] is a core principle at HubSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:55">[03:53:55]</a>. This means:
*   **Starting Simple**: Begin with the simplest possible approach for any process or system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">[03:40:40]</a>.
*   **Adding Complexity only when Necessary**: Only introduce complexity when absolutely required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:07">[03:44:07]</a>.
*   **Proportionality**: The effort spent on a decision or activity should be proportional to its potential consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:29">[03:07:29]</a>.

In product development, this translated to a "knob-for-knob" rule: every new feature added (a "knob or dial") required the removal of an existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:06">[04:06:06]</a>. This forced a focus on core customer problems and mindful addition of complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:55">[05:54:55]</a>.

### Lean into Strengths
Founders and leaders should focus on their strengths and avoid tasks they are not exceptional at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. For example, HubSpot's CTO, Dares Shaw, chose not to have any direct reports throughout his 18 years at the company, recognizing that he was not strong at managing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:38">[01:36:38]</a>. This allows individuals to concentrate their energy on what they excel at and enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:24">[01:27:24]</a>.

### Embracing Contrarian Approaches (Zigging when others Zag)
Successful companies often find success by doing the opposite of conventional wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This involves making "high conviction, low consensus bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>—being right about something others think is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>.

*   **Focusing on SMB**: HubSpot's early decision to focus on the small and medium-sized business (SMB) market was contrarian, as it was considered very hard to succeed in that space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:12">[02:59:12]</a>. However, this strategy allowed for quicker feedback loops, no revenue concentration, and the ability to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:57">[04:57:57]</a>.
*   **Broad Product Strategy**: Instead of focusing on one thing, HubSpot aimed to solve the comprehensive problem for its SMB customers by building an all-in-one product from year one, including SEO, web analytics, and blogging tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. This was against the common advice for startups to specialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. An early heuristic for this strategy was that if HubSpot was in the top three in a specific product category, it meant they had over-invested in that area, as their value proposition was the integration, not individual best-in-class tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:16">[05:53:16]</a>.

### Decision Making
*   **Identify a Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)**: For every decision, clearly designate one person responsible for making it. Data should inform decisions, but people make them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.
*   **Debate, Decide, Unite**: Encourage open debate to consider all options, but once a decision is made, everyone is expected to unite around it, even if they initially disagreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. This fosters alignment and avoids internal friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.
*   **Systematic Thinking**: Approach decisions systematically, like building an Excel spreadsheet or writing Python code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>. Identify all factors that should influence the decision, and if exact weights cannot be assigned, at least rank their importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.

### Cultivating Self-Fulfilling Prophecies
Cultural aspirations can become reality over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:52">[01:28:52]</a>. If a company publicly states an aspiration (e.g., in a culture document), new hires will assume that's the desired culture and work towards embodying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. It's acceptable to include aspirational statements, but they should be clearly identified as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>.

### Communication Tools
*   **Flash Tags**: To clarify the intent behind communications, particularly from leaders, HubSpot uses "flash tags" (like hashtags) in emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>. These tags indicate the level of conviction or expectation:
    *   `#FYI`: For your information, no response expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.
    *   `#suggestion`: A thought that might be worth exploring, no response expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.
    *   `#recommendation`: Thought-out advice, expecting a response if not followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>.
    *   `#plea`: A strong appeal for a specific action, not a mandate, but signifies high conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>. This avoids the "megaphone issue" where employees treat casual remarks as mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.

## [[applying_startup_principles_to_large_companies | Applying Startup Principles to Large Companies]]
Even as companies scale, fundamental startup principles can remain relevant. HubSpot, with over 7,000 employees, still maintains many of its early cultural practices and principles. The key is to consciously design the company to align with the founders' preferences and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. This includes things like having no meetings before 11:00 AM if founders are night owls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:19">[01:57:19]</a>.

The ultimate goal of [[building_a_culture_of_excellence | building a culture]] is to enable great people to do great things for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:49">[01:22:49]</a>.

Anuka Gupta, Chief Product Officer at Rubrik and lecturer at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, shares insights on how to foster effective communication and feedback within organizations, highlighting its importance for leadership and strategic impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Core of Strategic Communication

Being perceived as strategic involves two main aspects:
1.  **Articulating the "Why"**: The ability to develop and communicate a compelling and simple "why" behind company and product decisions and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
2.  **Championing Change**: Acting as a change agent to pursue initiatives that may be difficult but are in the long-term interest of the product or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Without both elements, individuals may not be seen as strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For instance, articulating the "why" with only small ideas, or championing big ideas without a clear "why", both hinder strategic perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

### Practical Application for Strategic Communication

A key tactical approach for effective communication is **summarization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. By summarizing discussions, especially in meetings with diverse voices, leaders can:
*   Clarify understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.
*   Ensure alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   Move conversations forward when stuck in circular discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   Be perceived as strategic, even without introducing new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

**Example phrases for summarization**: "Let me pause here for a second and try to capture what has been said" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>. This should end with a question to invite further discussion and ensure collective agreement or identify dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. Summarization can be done verbally, on a whiteboard, or in chat during virtual meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.

## Mindset for Communication

### Bringing Humor and Gratitude
Cultivating a mindset of **fun** in challenging situations can change an entire approach to dealing with difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This involves:
*   Asking: "What can I learn from this situation?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
*   Injecting humor into meetings to lighten the mood for oneself and others, which is vital for a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

This mindset extends to dealing with difficult personalities by finding what to learn from them and cultivating gratitude, regardless of whether one wishes to adopt their specific style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.

## [[Importance of giving and receiving feedback | Giving and Receiving Feedback]]

### Receiving Feedback
The process of [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | receiving feedback]] involves:
1.  **Acknowledge Emotions**: Allow oneself to feel natural emotions like upset or defensiveness without immediate reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>.
2.  **Curiosity**: After emotions pass, approach the feedback with curiosity to understand its source and validity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This may involve asking the giver for more context or discussing it with peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.
3.  **Prioritize**: All feedback reflects valid feelings, but not all require action. Prioritize based on what is best for the company and its immediate needs, distinguishing between "must-haves" and "nice-to-haves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.

Curiosity encourages others to provide more feedback, as they see their input is valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

### Giving Hard Feedback
[[effective_feedback_and_apology_structures | Giving hard feedback]] requires controlling one's own actions, body language, and words, as the recipient's response cannot be fully controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. Key [[effective_feedback_and_apology_structures | techniques]] include:
1.  **Convey Care and Intent**: Explicitly state that the feedback is given out of care and a desire for the person's success and ability to reach their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.
2.  **Be Direct**: Avoid passive-aggressive feedback. Clearly state "this is what you are doing" or "this is how you are being perceived," and offer actionable steps for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>.
3.  **Preparation**: Plan how to frame the feedback so it resonates without feeling like an attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>.
4.  **Examples and Brainstorming**: Provide specific examples, including personal experiences, and brainstorm solutions collaboratively, rather than simply delivering the feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.
5.  **Tailor Feedback**: Begin by asking about the individual's career goals. This helps tailor the feedback to what will genuinely matter for their development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>.
6.  **Focus on Perception**: Frame feedback as "this is how you're being perceived" rather than "you are doing X." This gives the individual the benefit of the doubt and allows for a conversation about changing perception rather than denying intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>.

## Navigating Difficult Personalities

When encountering difficult personalities, a mindset of being able to "work with anyone" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. Strategies include:
1.  **Understand Motivations**: Discover what truly drives the person, whether it's company success or personal career goals. This understanding helps in motivating them to align with desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. This can be figured out by talking to others who have successfully worked with them, such as direct reports or peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
2.  **Learn and Be Grateful**: Shift from anger or frustration to gratitude by asking, "What can I learn from this person?" Everyone has something to teach, whether it's communication style, ability to marshal people, or visionary ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.
3.  **Leverage Strengths**: As a product leader working with a founder in "founder mode," recognize the founder's power as a resource to drive initiatives essential for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Frame requests to the founder as opportunities to move the needle substantially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Decision-Making and Learning

### Being a "Historian"
To make better decisions, especially when joining a new company, it's beneficial to become a "historian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. This involves:
*   Understanding past product launches, successes, failures, and the reasons behind key decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.
*   Being curious about past projects to learn from mistakes not personally experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.
*   Understanding the "baggage" people carry from past unsuccessful attempts to do similar things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

### Act and Iterate
Instead of striving for the "right" decision, focus on **making a decision** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
*   Avoid analysis paralysis by accepting that one always operates with imprecise information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.
*   Committing to a decision, even if only 70% right, allows for learning and iteration in ways hypotheticals cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   Foster a culture that [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | rewards learning]] from outcomes, rather than just the outcome itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>. This means clarifying hypotheses and assumptions behind decisions so that when things don't work out, the team can analyze what was learned about the hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Cultivating a Positive Mindset

The mindset brought to work is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>. To build a positive mindset:
*   **Journaling**: Write down thoughts, especially negative ones, to explore their origin and determine if they are irrational or require action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. This externalization helps break down abstract ruminations and makes problem-solving possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.
*   **Self-Reflection**: Ask "Why am I feeling this way?" and "What is within my control?" to manage emotional responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.

This approach aligns with the principle that listening to and exploring difficult internal feelings reduces their power, creating space for desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.

### AI in Communication
AI tools are proving useful in **summarizing user research calls**, providing quick access to insights, transcripts, and context. This significantly aids in gleaning information from large volumes of qualitative data, making it a powerful capability for product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

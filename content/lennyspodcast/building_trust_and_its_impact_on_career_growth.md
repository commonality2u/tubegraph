Building trust is a crucial aspect of [[career_growth_and_personal_development | career growth and personal development]], particularly for product managers (PMs) and leaders. It is considered a "superpower" that significantly impacts an individual's ability to succeed and advance in their [[career development and advice | career]].

## The Currency of a Product Manager

Ian McAllister emphasizes that trust is the "currency" of a product manager and a product leader, becoming increasingly important as one progresses into senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The ability to build trust directly correlates with one's capacity to grow and succeed as a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This is because gaining more resources and influence relies on leadership trusting that you will utilize those resources effectively and deliver on your commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

## How Trust is Built

Trust is primarily built by repeatedly setting and meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This involves:
*   **Calling your shots, forecasting, and hitting goals:** Consistently setting goals and then achieving them demonstrates reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   **Honesty and transparency:** Always telling the truth, launching products when promised, and delivering what was committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   **Owning mistakes:** Acknowledging and learning from errors rather than ignoring or repeating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **Understanding and aligning with others:** Taking the time to understand the goals of other individuals and their organizations, and actively working to forge alliances and achieve alignment. This willingness to collaborate, rather than being "bullheaded," leads to greater overall success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

## Behaviors that Erode Trust

Conversely, certain behaviors can quickly diminish trust:
*   **Dishonesty or evasiveness:** Lying or being vague in communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
*   **Failing to deliver:** Not shipping what was promised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.
*   **Ignoring or repeating mistakes:** Not taking responsibility for errors or failing to learn from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

## Importance Across Career Stages

While important at all levels, building trust becomes even more critical for senior PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Ian reflects that he didn't fully recognize the importance of trust-building early or even in the middle of his own career, but later realized its significance, especially when observing it as a "superpower" in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

### Case Study: Ian's Experience at Airbnb

During his time at Airbnb, Ian led a team focused on building out the customer support technology platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. His approach was largely "heads down," focusing on strong analytics and prioritization, similar to his experience at Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. However, he realized in hindsight that he hadn't sufficiently partnered with the customer support leadership team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. Despite perceived alignment, he had not spent enough time and effort to build the true support needed to rally the organization around the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

This experience taught him that even if an approach is believed to be correct, without building the necessary support and relationships, the strategy may not be executed as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. A key part of success is mitigating the risk that a "right product" or "right strategy" won't land if the necessary support (trust) is not present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. This highlights the ongoing [[career_growth_and_personal_development | continuous improvement process]] that involves self-awareness and learning from experiences to better build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

## Overall Impact on Career

Having high standards for oneself and consistently focusing on building trust by being a reliable steward of resources and delivering impact will directly correlate with [[career development and progression strategies | career progression]] and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

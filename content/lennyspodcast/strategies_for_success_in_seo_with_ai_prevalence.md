From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

The landscape of search engine optimization (SEO) is undergoing a significant transformation with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) being integrated into search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This shift necessitates a new approach to SEO, moving beyond traditional tactics to a more product-led mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Shifting Landscape of SEO

AI-powered answers are now directly integrated into search results, fundamentally changing how users discover information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Google is actively rolling out these changes, greatly increasing the number of searches that include an AI-generated answer at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### How AI Overviews are Changing Search

Before AI overviews, winning in SEO often meant securing the first click on a long-form piece of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Now, Google and other search engines like Perplexity, Claude, and Meta are offering "AI overview" responses, often providing summarized answers directly in the search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. This means users may not need to click on individual links to get basic information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>.

Google's integration of AI answers was partly a response to OpenAI's ChatGPT, which demonstrated the ability to provide written-out answers to any question, leading to concerns that users might no longer need to click through search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:09">[07:09:09]</a>. While some initially feared an "SEO apocalypse," the impact is more about shifting relevance rather than an outright decline in traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:52">[01:52:52]</a>.

### The End of Top-of-Funnel Dominance

Historically, [[seo_strategies_for_successful_companies | SEO strategies for successful companies]] often focused on "top-of-funnel" or "big keywords" â€“ broad terms like "cars" or "top podcast tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. AI overviews are a great fit for these types of broad, discovery-focused queries, as they can quickly provide a concise answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

For instance, a search for "best beach vacation not in America but a 2-hour flight from X airport" could yield a direct AI answer, suggesting a destination like Cancun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This means content that aims to rank for such broad informational queries may become less relevant, as the AI delivers the answer directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

> "The discovery step of search is going to be swallowed up by LLMs that give you a direction and then once you have a sense of what you want then you go back to Google and that's where potentially the opportunity continues to remain." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>

## Rethinking SEO: A Product-Led Approach

Success in this new AI paradigm requires a fundamental shift in thinking about SEO, viewing it as a product question rather than solely a marketing challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Product managers, who understand the user journey and product positioning, are ideally suited to address these questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

The core steps to a [[productled_approach_to_seo | product-led approach to SEO]] are:
1.  **Be the user:** Understand who your user is and what problem they are trying to solve that would lead them to a search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.
2.  **Think about the asset to create:** Decide what experience or product you need to build for that user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.
3.  **Build the product for that SEO user:** This involves design, engineering, and user research, not just content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

### Understanding the User Journey

The key is to appeal to users who are on a self-discovery journey, not those attracted by social media or ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. If you can't identify what a user would search for to find your product, then SEO might not be the right strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

### Prioritizing Mid-Funnel & Bottom-Funnel Search

With AI handling top-of-funnel discovery, the opportunity for SEO shifts to mid-funnel and bottom-funnel queries, where users have more specific intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

*   **Top-of-funnel:** "Top podcast tools" (AI provides a list, e.g., from G2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Mid-funnel:** "Riverside price" or "Riverside capacity" after the AI has helped the user narrow down their options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This is where conversions are more likely to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

This shift helps the user, as they no longer have to sift through generic content optimized for SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### Examples: Zapier and Tinder

*   **Zapier:** The company built a product that allowed users to connect different apps. Initially, people didn't know "Zapier" existed, but they needed "Gmail to Salesforce connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. By creating landing pages at scale for every possible integration (e.g., "Connect Gmail to Salesforce"), Zapier showcased how their product solved a specific user need in the mid-funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Tinder:** Tinder's SEO strategy focused on solving the "loneliness problem" in new cities, rather than just "online dating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. They created programmatic pages for "online dating in [city name]," providing local date ideas and presenting Tinder as the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This addresses a mid-to-bottom funnel problem that AI overviews cannot fully solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

These examples highlight how building a product that inherently solves a user's search intent, even if the search is for a combination of tools or a specific local need, can drive conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Deciding on SEO Investment

[[effective_seo_resource_allocation | Effective SEO resource allocation]] requires a strategic decision-making process, recognizing that SEO is not free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.

### When SEO is Not the Right Fit

*   **B2B SaaS with complex sales cycles:** For products like Mixpanel or Google Cloud, where purchasing involves large commitments, multiple stakeholders, and sales conversations, SEO often yields poor ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Users don't convert directly from a search result; they need to engage with a sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Products solving unknown problems:** If users aren't actively searching for the problem your product solves, or the solution itself, SEO is less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This is more of a brand awareness challenge, often addressed through viral videos or other marketing channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Businesses without an online conversion journey:** Restaurants, for instance, don't typically benefit from SEO for their websites, as most orders come through apps like DoorDash or Google Maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

### Calculating Expected ROI

Instead of defaulting to SEO because competitors do it, evaluate its cost against potential returns compared to other marketing channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Consider the investment in PMs, engineers, content, and agencies, and whether it will generate sufficient revenue quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. A top-down forecast, estimating market share within a total addressable market (TAM), can provide a more realistic picture than a bottoms-up keyword-based forecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:16">[01:37:16]</a>.

### Measuring Success: Beyond Rankings and Traffic

The primary measure of SEO success should align with business goals, not just vanity metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

*   **Conversion Metrics:** Track [[identifying_growth_opportunities_via_seo | marketing qualified leads (MQLs)]], actual dollar conversions, phone calls, or video views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
*   **Page Views/CPM:** Relevant for media companies monetizing through ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   **Rankings:** Only if it directly impacts a business goal, such as influencing investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
*   **Traffic Alone:** Traffic is not a valuable metric if it doesn't convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

> "Driving traffic to something that doesn't convert you for you wouldn't be a good idea." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>

Set milestones and track progress against them to determine if your SEO efforts are on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. For large, well-known brands, SEO efforts can show results quickly once implemented; for smaller companies, it may take many months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

## Leveraging AI in SEO Strategy

[[using_ai_tools_for_product_management_and_development | Using AI tools for product management and development]] in SEO is about using them as *tools*, not as a complete solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>.

### AI for Useful Content Generation

AI can be used to generate content, but it should be useful and part of the user's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. For example:
*   Writing product descriptions for e-commerce sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.
*   Summarizing earnings reports or sports game statistics, where the content is factual and helpful, even if not journalistically written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

Do not use AI to generate "fluff" content or thousands of blog posts that are not useful for the end-user journey or the company's monetization goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. Google's documentation states that AI itself is not the problem; the helpfulness and usefulness of the content are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

### Brand Building and AI Overviews

Appearing in AI overviews is largely a brand challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. If your brand is mentioned, it means you've successfully built brand awareness through other efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. If your link appears, it might mean Google has "stolen" your content by summarizing it, and users may or may not click through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

## Programmatic vs. Editorial SEO

There are two main approaches to SEO content creation:

### Defining Programmatic and Editorial

*   **Programmatic SEO:** Involves taking multiple data sources (e.g., hotel properties, cities, user-generated content for Tripadvisor; government property data, photos, neighborhood data for Zillow) and programmatically generating a unique page for each combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This scales efficiently for millions of unique pages.
*   **Editorial SEO:** Involves manually writing long-form content for each topic, like a travel blogger writing detailed articles about individual hotels or cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

### When to Choose Programmatic

Programmatic SEO is the right solution when there is:
1.  **Scale:** A large number of unique combinations or data points that would be cost-prohibitive to cover editorially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
2.  **User Use Case:** Each programmatically generated page must provide a specific solution or answer that users are actively looking for, directly feeding into your product's core function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

> "Generally, programmatic is the better path and the most common success path." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>

Simply creating programmatic pages for the sake of having content, without a clear user need, is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Common SEO Myths Debunked

Many misconceptions exist about SEO, leading to ineffective strategies:

*   **SEO is Always Necessary:** There is no default assumption that every company, especially B2B SaaS startups, needs to invest heavily in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. It's a strategic decision based on the user journey and conversion path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Link Building is the Only Secret Sauce:** Traditional link building by buying guest posts or links on low-authority websites is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. True "link building" is [[seo_and_content_marketing_insights | brand building]], where a valuable product naturally earns mentions and links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Google is a Blackbox:** While nuances exist, the basics of SEO are simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Google provides best practice guides: build an understandable website, link appropriately, and create helpful content users want to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **Technical SEO is a Universal Fix:** For large websites with millions of pages, technical SEO (e.g., site structure, crawling) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. However, for smaller websites (e.g., 100-page SaaS sites), spending heavily on technical SEO fixes like page speed is often a waste of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Google penalizes unhelpful content, not just technical errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## The Future of Search and SEO

[[impact_of_ai_on_seo | The impact of AI on SEO]] is significant, but search is not dying.

### Google's Enduring Dominance

Despite the emergence of LLMs and legal challenges, Google's dominance in search is likely to persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. A recent verdict in a Department of Justice case revealed Google has 98% of mobile searches, driven by default partnerships (e.g., with Apple) and strong brand recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Competitors struggle to gain market share even with superior products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

Google invests in AI overviews not out of fear of being unseated, but to satisfy Wall Street and avoid losing even small percentage points of search volume, which translates to significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

### The Role of Social Media in Search

While platforms like TikTok and Instagram are increasingly used for top-of-funnel discovery (e.g., travel inspiration), Google remains the go-to for mid-funnel queries with clear intent (e.g., booking a hotel or flights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Different user journeys are better suited for different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

### The Growing Need for SEO Expertise

The need for SEO expertise is expected to grow significantly due to changes in search layouts and the need for companies to pivot their approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This means a rising demand for SEO consultants and advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

[[the_impact_of_ai_on_musthave_skills_and_startup_strategies | The impact of AI on must-have skills and startup strategies]] for aspiring SEO advisors focuses on communication, sales, and proposals, rather than solely operational expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

> "SEO is not dying; there will always be a world where users are requesting their own information." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>

The aggregate number of people needing to take action (e.g., buy shoes, book a hotel) does not change, even if search volumes for broad terms shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Companies that monetize actions rather than just information will continue to benefit from SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is a concept for scaled agile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It emerged from the desire to scale scrum and other processes across large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. SAFe was initially developed by Dean Leffingwell to demonstrate how to connect multiple teams at scale within an organization and introduce rigor and process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. It is not the only scaling framework, with others including LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum) and Scrum@Scale by Jeff Sutherland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.

## Origin of SAFe and the Product Owner Role

The [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owner]] role itself did not emerge from product management as it is known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Its initial purpose was to help developers prioritize their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This role stemmed from Scrum, which in turn came from the Agile movement started by software developers in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The Agile Manifesto, written by developers, focused on building better products through software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

The Scrum Guide, co-written by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, outlined roles for a development team, including developers, a [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owner]], and a Scrum Master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The original Scrum Guide stated that the [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owner]] is responsible for maximizing the value of work done by the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. It also suggested that for commercial development, the [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owner]] could be the product manager, or for in-house efforts, a user department manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. However, later versions of the Scrum Guide (e.g., 2013) removed the explicit mention that a product manager could be a [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owner]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owner]] role often became someone who collected requirements from internal "customers" rather than focusing on market research or customer understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Scrum training for [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owners]] typically focuses on managing backlogs, running stand-ups, and prioritizing work, but not on experimentation, market research, or data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

## Why Companies Adopt SAFe

Many large companies, especially those not traditionally software-focused (e.g., banks, telecom, pharmaceutical companies), adopt SAFe and other [[agile_methodologies_and_their_implications_in_large_organizations | agile methodologies]] because they seek a structured approach to implement rigor at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. Executives often favor SAFe because it provides a comprehensive, "plug-and-play" operating model for development, which is easy to understand and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. These companies are often just beginning their digital transformations and are looking for guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>.

## Structure and Components of SAFe

SAFe aims to tie multiple agile teams together into "release trains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. Key aspects include:
*   **Release Trains**: Groups of agile teams that work together to ship features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
*   **Big Room Planning**: Quarterly events where entire release trains gather to map out and commit to work for the quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.
*   **Role Split**: SAFe often creates a distinction between Product Managers and [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
    *   The [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owner]] is part of the agile team with Scrum Masters (team coaches) and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. They primarily focus on maintaining full backlogs for developers, often at a very narrow component level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.
    *   The Product Manager sits with a system architect and a release train engineer, handling more strategic discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

## Criticisms and [[challenges_and_adaptations_in_implementing_safe | Challenges in Implementing SAFe]]

Melissa Perry does not recommend using SAFe as a general approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. While some find success by adapting it, they usually "rip it up and make it into something else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.

Key criticisms and [[challenges_and_adaptations_in_implementing_safe | challenges]]:
*   **Overkill and Rigidity**: SAFe is often seen as Overkill, particularly for smaller companies or startups that already have effective ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. It can become too rigid and process-focused, leading to teams talking *about* work instead of *doing* work or delivering value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Lack of Discovery Focus**: SAFe does not adequately describe how to perform critical product work like discovery, market research, or user testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owners]] often feel they lack time for customer interaction due to continuous sprints and backlog maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.
*   **Detached Roles**: The split between Product Manager and [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owner]] often makes the [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owner]] an "order taker," extremely tactical and without exposure to strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. This often results in a poor [[product_management_skill_development_framework | career path]] for [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.
*   **Developer Reliance**: Developers can become overly reliant on [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owners]] or Product Managers to dictate tasks, even for tech debt, hindering their ability to self-organize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.
*   **False Sense of Solution**: SAFe can act as a "crutch" for leaders who are new to running large-scale technology organizations, providing a seemingly complete plan without addressing the underlying need for skilled product leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>.

One striking example of SAFe's potential pitfalls is a water company in the Netherlands that reportedly went bankrupt because its IT teams became so engrossed in learning and implementing SAFe processes that they delayed deploying a new invoicing system, preventing them from collecting payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.

## Alternatives and Better Approaches to [[agile_methodologies_and_their_implications_in_large_organizations | Agile Methodologies]]

Instead of rigidly adopting frameworks like SAFe, companies should focus on developing a comprehensive operating model that goes beyond just development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>. This includes:
1.  **Product Strategy**: Developing a clear product strategy that aligns with business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>.
2.  **Organizational Design**: Structuring the organization around products, ensuring good coverage of skilled product managers at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.
3.  **[[Product Operations and Scaling Product Management | Product Operations]]**: Establishing infrastructure to support teams, such as access to data and direct customer interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
4.  **Culture and Incentives**: Rewarding value delivery and measurable impact, not just shipping volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
5.  **Transparency and Process**: Implementing necessary processes (e.g., roadmapping tools) to provide transparency across thousands of teams and ensure efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
6.  **[[building_and_scaling_product_leadership_programs | Developing Product Leadership Programs]]**: Ensuring that Product Management leaders (Directors, VPs, CPOs) understand their role in strategy and can enable their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

Companies should bring in experienced product people at leadership levels to help guide transformations, combining external expertise with internal talent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. It is crucial for C-suite leadership to recognize that digital transformation is a fundamental shift in the way of working, not just a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.

## Product Owner vs. Product Manager

In the tech industry, particularly at top software-first companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix, the [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owner]] role typically does not exist; instead, they have Product Managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>. This highlights that scaling product development does not inherently require a separate [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owner]] role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>.

For individuals in a [[role_of_the_product_owner_in_agile_processes | Product Owner]] role who want to transition to Product Management, the key is to shift focus from process-oriented tasks (e.g., prioritizing backlogs, writing user stories) to demonstrating value delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. This involves:
*   **Focusing on Outcomes**: Articulating the problems solved, the goals achieved, and the measurable impact on users and the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.
*   **Gaining Experience**: Seeking opportunities to participate in customer research, understand market needs, and connect work to business objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.
*   **Advocating for Career Paths**: Asking leaders about career progression and pushing for opportunities to develop strategic product management skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.
*   **Resume Enhancement**: Describing their role from a value perspective, emphasizing user understanding, problem-solving, and metrics moved, rather than agile ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.

### Certifications

Certifications like Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) are often obtained through short classes, which do not necessarily equip individuals with the full skills needed to be effective Product Managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. These certifications are often driven by the "agile industrial complex," where organizations profit from training and consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. While a CSPO might help secure a role in a large enterprise adopting Scrum and SAFe, tech companies typically prioritize experience over certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>. There is no quick way to become a great product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[agile_methodologies_and_their_implications_in_large_organizations | Agile methodologies]] and SAFe are tools meant to help organizations move quickly and deliver value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. However, rigid adherence to processes without focusing on the underlying principles of understanding customers, building the right product, and fostering product strategy will not lead to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>. Companies, regardless of their industry, need to embed software strategy at the C-suite level to drive innovation and effectively compete in a digital-first world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.

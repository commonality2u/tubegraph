Nonan You, Head of Product at Linear, discusses the unique strategies employed at Linear to build a highly regarded and rapidly growing B2B SaaS product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. Linear is praised for its design, performance, and speed, leading many users to wish they could switch from existing tools like Jira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The company's inception was driven by the desire to address the frustration engineers and designers experienced with existing tools, aiming to make work fun again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Key Principles for Building Beloved Products

Linear's success stems from several core principles that challenge conventional wisdom in B2B software development.

### Speed and Quality are Not a Trade-off
Many believe there's a trade-off between speed and quality, often over-indexing on rushing or sloppiness when thinking about speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on competence and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. At the pinnacle of any craft, the quality of output is often directly proportional to the speed of execution, indicating deep mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

For software development, speed looks like having a workable solution within 10% of the rough time budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This allows for early testing of key hypotheses internally, preventing delays and uncovering incorrect assumptions before 80% of the work is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This approach enables numerous iterations, a critical component of product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

**Tactics for Speed without Sacrificing Quality:**
*   **Talent**: Having skilled engineers who can quickly create workable solutions without getting bogged down by every design choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Intent**: Abandoning the expectation that the first version will be perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The goal is to validate or invalidate major assumptions, not to achieve pixel-perfect design or solve all UI bugs immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Early Feedback**: Releasing new features or product ideas to internal users, and then to a growing list of beta users, as early as possible (e.g., within the first 10% of allotted time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This helps identify if the product is heading in the right direction, avoiding wasted time on building unwanted features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

### Prioritizing the User (IC) Over the Buyer (Middle Manager)
Linear actively avoids feature requests that lead to "bloatedness," specifically customization features requested by middle managers for easier reporting, at the expense of individual contributor (IC) workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. This is a core promise of Linear: they will not make this trade-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

PMs often face pressure from sales and buyers to add features that appeal to gatekeepers, but these additions can worsen the IC user experience, leading to disengagement and inaccurate data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Linear's approach is to convince buyers that such features are a "false trade-off" and that making the team more effective is the true reason for purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

When debating new features, the focus is on understanding real-life use cases tied to specific individuals, not hypothetical personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. The goal is to solve the most critical problems way better than competitors, focusing on concentrated pools of use cases rather than building broad, long-tail features that might not match reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.

### Deep Customer Understanding
A critical skill for product managers is to keep digging in customer calls until they uncover true insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. The goal is to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. This means going beyond analytical goals and understanding the *emotional valence* motivating their requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

This approach helps uncover "schle blindness"â€”the unrecognized daily frustrations users endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. By deeply understanding these emotional pain points, solutions can be crafted that truly resonate, like Linear's triage management feature, which automated manual processes that previously left users "totally underwater" or feeling "out of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

### Testing Extreme Versions of Product Ideas
To foster creativity and develop non-obvious solutions, Linear explores the "possibility space" by asking: "How extreme can you take it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. This involves throwing away constraints like cost or practicality to imagine the "11-star experience" or the "most luxurious version" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

This method helps break free from psychic constraints and uncover choices not initially considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>. For example, when developing a draft saving feature for issues, they first built the "fastest" version (no pop-ups, just close) which felt too unsafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. Then they tried the "safest" version (autosave everything), which led to a "crazy paper trail" of unwanted drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. The final solution balanced these extremes, interrupting only for new issues and autosaving existing drafts, a specific choice derived from experiencing the extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.

This approach aligns with the principle of getting things out quickly, but with "extreme versions" that are not expected to work long-term, serving primarily as learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

### Products as Teachers
B2B software doesn't just solve problems; it teaches users *how to work* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. When a company adopts a tool, they're often adopting a battl-tested way of practicing a discipline, bringing a baseline level of competence into their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.

Linear, for instance, is opinionated about how product teams should operate, based on successful practices observed in high-performing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. Instead of allowing extensive customization that can lead to bad outcomes, they provide automated features that encourage best practices, like the triage queue management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>. Therefore, choosing a tool is also choosing a way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.

## Internal Collaboration: The Double Triangle
Linear views product management as a "go-to-market discipline," alongside sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>. While the traditional "PM, engineering, design triad" is valuable, the collaboration between product, sales, and marketing is often under-examined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>.

Linear emphasizes a "double triangle" model where the PM is in the middle, connecting engineering, product, and design (the "building side") with sales, marketing, and product management (the "selling side") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>. This ensures that what is built aligns with the company's commercial motivations and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.

Product managers are encouraged to originate the message sent to the audience, leveraging their deep understanding of the customer's native language gained through discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. This involves being highly involved in product marketing, writing emails, headlines, and website content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.

## Deadlines as a Priority Zero Problem
Linear takes deadlines "so seriously that they are basically like a P-zero problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>. This signals to the team and stakeholders that the deadline is paramount.

**Key aspects of Linear's approach to deadlines:**
*   **Fewer Deadlines**: Don't have too many deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.
*   **Unwavering Focus**: When a deadline is set, engineers don't work on anything else; scope is cut as much as possible to ensure the deadline is met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.
*   **External Marketing Focus**: Deadlines are typically set for external marketing exercises, such as a major product launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.
*   **Missed Opportunities**: Missing a launch opportunity (e.g., a quarterly marketing communication) means that opportunity is gone forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.
*   **Minimal Estimation**: Linear does "almost no estimating" for deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. Instead, they focus on shipping as early as possible. By having a working version within 10% of the time, they can then decide whether to iterate further or polish it for release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>. This sets up the team to make a go/no-go decision with a functional product, even if it doesn't have every desired feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.

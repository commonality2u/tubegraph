Claire Hughes Johnson, former Chief Operating Officer (COO) at Stripe for seven years, where she helped scale the company from a small startup to its current status, shares her insights on company building and scaling in her book "Scaling People" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Before her time at Stripe, Johnson spent about 10 years at Google, holding various leadership roles including VP of self-driving cars, VP of global online sales, and director of sales and operations for Gmail, YouTube, Google Apps, and AdWords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. Her book emphasizes that successful scaling requires a focus on both company structures and effective management practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>.

## Personal Operating Principles

Johnson highlights that effective management and [[lessons_on_company_growth_and_innovation | company building]] begin with the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:50">[02:27:50]</a>. She outlines several personal operating principles that are foundational to her approach:

*   **Build Self-Awareness to Build Mutual Awareness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>: This is the most fundamental aspect of success in [[leadership_and_management_challenges_in_scaling_a_company | company building]] or management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:09">[02:59:09]</a>. By seeking feedback, understanding personal motivators, strengths, blind spots, and tendencies, and exposing these to others, individuals can become more effective leaders and builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:18">[02:28:18]</a>. An exercise to crystallize personal values involves ranking and explaining core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:22">[02:52:22]</a>.
*   **Say the Thing You Think You Cannot Say** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:25">[02:25:25]</a>: Often, a person's biggest strength is something they don't realize because it comes so naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:36">[02:27:36]</a>. To say uncomfortable things, one should detoxify internal commentary by asking questions, owning observations as personal perceptions (not judgments), and avoiding threatening language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:54">[02:34:54]</a>. This approach turns a lecture into an exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:17">[02:35:17]</a>.
*   **Distinguish Management from Leadership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>: A manager's job is to enable people to be their best, not merely to be the expert who tells people what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:35">[02:37:35]</a>. This involves providing context and information, and coaching through exploration and hypothesis-based conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:09">[02:38:09]</a>.
*   **Come Back to the Operating System** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:57">[02:29:57]</a>: In chaotic, high-growth environments, it's crucial to create stability through ritual and common practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:17">[02:44:17]</a>. This "operating system" provides a consistent way to approach common tasks, preventing constant reinvention and paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:17">[02:45:17]</a>.

## The Company as a House: Structure and Cadence

Johnson uses a house-building analogy to explain company structure, comprising foundational documents, supporting structures (like operating practices), and mechanicals (operating cadence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

### Foundational Documents
These are the core principles that define the company's purpose and how it operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:49">[02:47:49]</a>:

*   **Mission**: A concise statement of what the company aims to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:01">[02:53:01]</a>. For Stripe, the mission became "to increase the GDP of the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:06">[02:53:06]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Goals**: Provides more detail than the mission, explaining *why* the company exists and what it seeks to achieve over a longer period (e.g., advancing the state of the art in developer tools for Stripe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:52">[02:53:52]</a>.
*   **Operating Principles/Values**: Defines how the company works internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:46">[02:55:46]</a>. These can be shared externally to help candidates self-evaluate if the company culture is a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:01">[02:56:01]</a>.

A sign that a company needs to invest more in these documents is when new hires ask many questions about what's important or how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:20">[02:52:20]</a>.

### Operating System and Cadence
This refers to the repeatable processes and rhythms that drive work and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:38">[02:58:38]</a>:

*   **Goals/OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**: A structured approach to setting and achieving milestones, whether numeric or binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:52">[02:58:52]</a>. Long-term goals can inform shorter-term, numerical objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:04">[02:57:04]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)**: A structured way to review parts of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:07">[02:59:07]</a>. The frequency of these reviews should be adjusted based on the stage and needs of the product or team (e.g., six-week reviews for new product areas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:25">[03:01:25]</a>.
    *   **Signs a Cadence is Off**: If too little progress is made between reviews, it might be too fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:51">[03:01:51]</a>. If content feels stale or redundant, it might be too slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:26">[03:02:26]</a>.
*   **Metrics and Dashboards**: Essential for measuring progress, using input and output metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:25">[02:59:25]</a>. Johnson recommends looking at live dashboards rather than special presentations to avoid overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:30">[03:03:30]</a>.
*   **Planning Processes**: Crucial for defining future direction, despite often feeling burdensome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:51">[02:59:51]</a>.

It's better to do a few things consistently and well than to constantly try new, untested processes, which creates chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:52">[02:49:52]</a>. There is no perfect system; the goal is to commit to a good one and work around its flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:35">[02:50:35]</a>.

## Tactical Advice for Scaling Companies

*   **Hiring**: Think about needed capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. Develop clear evaluation criteria, identify where to find talent, and train interviewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:16">[02:05:16]</a>. As companies grow, a formal job structure with levels and ladders becomes necessary to ensure fairness, even if it feels "sub-optimal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>. Implementing this early can prevent more significant challenges later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.
*   **Seeking Knowledge**: [[Lessons on company growth and innovation | Founders]] should actively seek knowledge from others, whether by talking to other companies or reading widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. This includes understanding challenges faced by similar companies in areas like support operations and hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
*   **Titles**: At Stripe, titles were kept minimal to signal a non-hierarchical culture where expertise drives decisions, not seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. It also provides optionality, preventing the need to re-layer or demote titles as teams grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>. When interacting with larger companies, employees can creatively represent their broad scope without fabricating titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>.
*   **Chaos is Normal**: Most successful companies experience internal chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:08">[01:51:08]</a>. The key is to implement "stabilizing ways of doing things" to create a perception of being well-run, even amidst the chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:19">[01:51:19]</a>.
*   **Effective Meetings**: The purpose of a meeting must be explicit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. Define the objective (e.g., decision-making, information sharing), who needs to be there, and who is making the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>.
*   **Decision-Making**: For product managers with accountability but little authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>, it's crucial to make the decision-making process explicit. Use frameworks like Spade (from Gokul Rajaram) or RACI to define who makes decisions, the criteria, and who needs to be informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>. If unsure who the decision-maker is, assume it's you and act accordingly, then ask for clarification if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.
*   **Alignment**: Use common, codified documents (mission, goals, values) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>. Employ intelligent communication practices, recognizing that different channels reach different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. Leaders must be "repeaters-in-chief," consistently sharing core messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>.
*   **Off-sites**: These events pull people out of their daily routines, creating space for different thinking and cementing group experiences and plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>.
*   **Company Updates**: Invest in internal communication infrastructure, such as an intranet, newsletters, and quick videos from founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. Sales teams often excel at this by needing to keep sellers updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.

## The Role of the COO

A COO role is not automatic for every company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>, but it can provide significant [[leadership_and_management_challenges_in_scaling_a_company | leverage]] for founders in high-growth environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. The COO can take on functions like product, business operations, or specific go-to-market initiatives, helping to build them out and bringing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. Hiring a COO should not be seen as a "silver bullet" to solve all cultural or operational issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>, nor as a way for founders to offload all tasks they dislike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. A fantastic COO-CEO relationship is characterized by mutual understanding, trust, forward momentum, and "just the right amount of tension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>.

Johnson emphasizes that [[lessons_on_company_growth_and_innovation | scaling a company]] is hard work with no shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, but her book aims to accelerate knowledge for leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The core message remains: "Be a force for positive momentum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

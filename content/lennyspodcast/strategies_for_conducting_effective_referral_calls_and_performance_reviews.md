One crucial strategy for evaluating potential hires and setting them up for success involves a specific question asked during reference calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. This approach aims to gather more authentic and actionable feedback than typical reference checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## Asking for Feedback on Future Performance

Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer at Intercom, suggests a powerful question for reference calls:
> "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>

This question is designed to elicit genuine insights because the person providing the reference cannot easily avoid giving a substantive answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. It compels them to consider potential areas for growth or constructive feedback that might arise in a formal review setting, providing a more balanced understanding of the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

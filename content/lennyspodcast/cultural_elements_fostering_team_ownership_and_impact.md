At DoorDash, the approach to data analytics is rooted in a culture that emphasizes business impact and extreme ownership, rather than a purely service-oriented function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This philosophy, championed by leaders like Jessica Lax, Vice President of Analytics and Data Science, aims to foster an environment where teams are proactive, aligned with business goals, and deeply invested in outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Defining Business Impact for Data Teams

Analytics at DoorDash is considered a "business impact driving function," not merely a service to answer questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The goal is to find opportunities and offer a point of view on decisions, moving beyond "why" something happened to "what do we do now that we know this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Strategic Metric Selection
A core element of driving impact is selecting the right metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Short-term for Long-term Output:** It's crucial to identify a short-term, measurable metric that drives a desired long-term outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. For instance, retention is a difficult metric to goal on in the short term, so it's better to focus on input metrics that lead to retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
*   **Simplicity Over Perfection:** Simple, understandable metrics are preferred over complex, composite ones, even if the latter might seem "more perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. Metrics that are intuitive and can be discussed widely across the company drive better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>.
*   **Common Currency:** Quantifying different business levers (e.g., price changes, delivery times) in a common currency (like gross order value, GOV, or volume) enables informed trade-offs and faster decision-making across teams like marketing and logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.
*   **Focus on Edge Cases and Fail States:** While averages are important, actively setting goals and creating metrics around "disaster deliveries" or "never delivered" orders, which are rare but highly impactful, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. These lead to churn and significant costs, and addressing them can have a powerful impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

## Fostering Extreme Ownership

[[the_importance_of_ownership_in_leadership | Extreme ownership]] is a deeply ingrained cultural trait at DoorDash, stemming from its founder, Tony Xu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. This means employees are expected to do "whatever you need to win," even if it falls outside their job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>.

### Cultural Practices
*   **Proactive Problem Solving:** Data teams are encouraged to be proactive, find opportunities, and generate insights through self-directed work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This requires intentional time carving for exploratory deep dives, often supported by business partners due to the historical success of such initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Hackathons are one mechanism used to facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **Saying No Through Trade-offs:** To balance proactive work with inbound requests, teams are advised to clearly communicate priorities and trade-offs. By aligning goals with business partners, a data professional can ask, "Is this new data pull more important than these three things I was planning to work on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a> This approach ensures the team works on the most impactful tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.
*   **"Roll Up Your Sleeves" Mentality:** Early DoorDash employees demonstrated a willingness to take on any task necessary for success, from handing out promo codes in the freezing winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a> to jumping on customer support during a site outage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. This "whatever it takes" attitude is still expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. Even data scientists are expected to directly engage with customers if it helps solve a problem and understand "what's happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. This fosters a sense of "ownership of the outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>.
*   **Customer-First Approach:** DoorDash's culture deeply ingrains a focus on its three customer types: consumers, Dashers, and merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. The "We Dash" program, where all employees periodically go out as Dashers or do customer support, builds empathy and helps identify product issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.

### Hiring for Culture
When hiring for the analytics team, beyond technical skills, several qualities are prioritized:
*   **Curiosity and Self-Motivation:** The ability to proactively "pull on the threads" and investigate anomalies without being told is highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This can be tested by presenting a case study with subtle inconsistencies to see if candidates notice and investigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solving and Decision-Making:** Candidates are assessed on their ability to handle ambiguity, break down problems, and make decisions even with incomplete information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. Their reaction to being told they are "wrong" in a case study reveals their adaptability and ability to pivot with new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.
*   **Non-Traditional Backgrounds and Diverse Skills:** The analytics team welcomes individuals from various backgrounds (e.g., operations, finance, engineering) who have acquired the necessary technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. This diversity of expertise, including different prior company stages, fosters mutual learning and a unique team environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. Jessica Lax herself came from an art and finance background, self-teaching data science out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. This diverse mix, particularly with those who have a finance background, helps keep the focus on driving business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.

### Team Structure and Collaboration
A centralized analytics organization (Center of Excellence) is favored over embedded teams reporting into business units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. While central, the team is divided into "pods" that align with product, engineering, operations, and marketing, ensuring close partnership and shared goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Benefits of this centralized model:
*   **Consistent Talent Bar:** Ensures uniform evaluation of candidates, leading to higher and more consistent talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Growth Opportunities:** Offers clear career paths and opportunities for team members to move between different problem areas or management roles within the central organization, helping retain talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Consistency in Methodologies and Metrics:** Prevents silos from developing disparate definitions and approaches, leading to unified understanding and improved practices across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Scalability:** Allows for the identification and automation of common problems across different business units, promoting efficient growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Strong Team Culture:** [[creating_and_maintaining_team_culture_and_passion | Fosters a unique "A Team" culture]] of learning and sharing, where members can collaborate, peer review, and find like-minded colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Impact on Team Dynamics and Decision-Making

This culture fosters an environment where the data team actively contributes to product roadmaps and strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. By bringing data-driven insights, deep dives, and analysis of trade-offs, they earn their "seat at the table" and uncover opportunities for growth and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The culture allows for "truth seeking" by encouraging individuals to discern fact from fiction and speak the truth, which is a company value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>.

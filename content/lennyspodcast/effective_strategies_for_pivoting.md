Pivoting is a crucial strategy for startups, often leading to success after initial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Dalton Caldwell, Managing Director and Group Partner at Y Combinator (YC), emphasizes that a good pivot feels like "going home" â€“ it's warmer and closer to something you are already an expert in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Successful Pivot

A successful pivot typically exhibits two key characteristics:
1.  **Closer to Expertise** It moves the company towards an area where the founders possess existing expertise or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
2.  **Builds on Prior Learnings** The new idea leverages insights gained from the previous venture, even if the initial idea was unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

This approach often uncovers "good unique insights" that wouldn't have been apparent from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Founders don't necessarily need to have all the experience before starting the company; it can be gained through the process of trying to build a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### Examples of Successful Pivots

*   **Brex:** Originally named "Vyond," the company started as a VR headset venture. Its founders pivoted to fintech, an area they had prior experience with, eventually becoming Brex, a decacorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Retool:** Initially a P2P Venmo competitor in the UK called "Cashew," Retool pivoted to build internal tools. This leveraged the founders' experience building dashboards for their original product, which they recognized as a valuable offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Segment:** Began with software for universities to indicate student confusion in class. Through this, they learned about analytics and eventually pivoted to a platform for sending events to multiple endpoints, becoming a successful company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
*   **Zip:** After several pivots, Zip's founders, guided by Caldwell, focused on a "knowable big market with an incumbent combined with the software is horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. They targeted procurement software, a space with large, disliked incumbents, becoming "beasts" at engaging customers to understand the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## When to Consider a Pivot

Deciding when to pivot is a nuanced decision. A key indicator is when founders run out of new ideas to grow their current venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. If a startup is struggling and the team has exhausted all plausible growth strategies, it's likely a good time to consider a new direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

Conversely, if there are still "half a dozen or a dozen really good grow ideas" that haven't been tried, it might be worth staying the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Ultimately, it comes down to whether the founders are still enjoying the work, love their customers, and are passionate about the problem they are solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. [[signs_of_being_stuck_at_a_productmarket_fit_stage_and_how_to_pivot | Being stuck at the product-market fit stage]] is often a cue for a pivot.

## Ideas to Avoid: "Tarpit Ideas"

Caldwell warns against "tarpit ideas," which are deceptively appealing concepts that many people gravitate towards but ultimately get stuck in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. These ideas often seem like unsolved problems and receive positive initial feedback, but they're inherently difficult to build sustainable businesses around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

Examples of tarpit ideas include:
*   Apps for coordinating social outings with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   Music discovery platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   Foursquare clones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

These ideas can receive "good initial validation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, but their underlying challenges make them difficult to scale or monetize, leading to founders getting trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Ideas to Explore: YC's "Request for Startups"

YC publishes a "Request for Startups" to inspire founders to explore new and less conventional ideas, aiming to diversify the "information diet" of entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. These are not exclusive funding categories but rather areas YC is excited about and sees potential for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

Some examples of ideas YC is interested in funding include:
*   Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   Open-source companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   Space companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
*   Hard Science/Deep Tech, such as solutions to end cancer, spatial computing, new defense technology, or bringing manufacturing back to America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   "Better Enterprise Glue" to connect disparate business systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
*   Small fine-tuned AI models as alternatives to gigantic generic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

These suggestions encourage founders to look beyond saturated or "fashionable" spaces and leverage their unique experiences or pursue less conventional fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

## The "Don't Die" Mantra and Persistence

A core philosophy for startups, especially when facing [[challenges_in_early_startup_growth_and_product_pivots | challenges in early startup growth]], is "just don't die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. Many successful companies, like Airbnb, faced multiple near-death experiences where rationally, they should have given up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. It often takes an "irrational intention to keep going" even when the world suggests failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

Dalton Caldwell observes that startups more commonly fail because founders lose hope and decide to quit, rather than running completely out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. As long as founders don't accept failure, there are usually "a lot more moves you can try to save the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This resilience and commitment to keeping the startup alive are vital, even through pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

### Knowing When to Quit

While persistence is key, it's also important for founders to check in with themselves. If they are no longer having fun, don't enjoy working with their co-founders, or if the venture is profoundly affecting their mental health and relationships negatively, it might be the right time to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. In such cases, giving up is "no big deal" and won't be remembered in the long term, as long as integrity is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. [[entrepreneurship_lessons_and_strategies | Life is short]], and forcing oneself to continue a miserable endeavor to "avoid losing face" comes at a significant opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Pivoting effectively is a blend of strategic insight, adaptability, and emotional resilience. By understanding what makes a good pivot, being aware of common pitfalls like "tarpit ideas," and maintaining a persistent yet self-aware approach, founders can significantly increase their chances of navigating the [[strategies_for_company_growth_and_overcoming_internal_challenges | challenging startup journey]] towards success.

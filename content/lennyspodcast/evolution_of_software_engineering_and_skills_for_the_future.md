From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Michael Tru, co-founder and CEO of Any Sphere, the company behind Cursor, envisions a future "after code," where the process of building software is radically different from today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. His company, Cursor, is at the forefront of this shift, changing how engineers and product teams build software with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

## The "After Code" Era

The goal is to invent a new type of programming, distilled into describing intent to the computer in the most concise way possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This future programming method will be "legions higher level and more productive," and in some cases, more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Michael contrasts this vision with two prevailing ideas:
*   **Traditional Code Editing:** Some believe software building will largely remain text editing in formal languages like TypeScript or Go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Chatbot-style Interaction:** Others imagine simply typing requests into a bot to build or change software, akin to a "chatbot Slackbot style" where you're talking to an engineering department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Tru argues both visions have problems: the chatbot style lacks precision for human control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, and the idea that nothing changes is wrong because technology will improve significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

The future of software creation, "after code," will involve a representation of software logic that looks more like English or an [[evolution_and_future_of_software_engineering_roles | evolution of programming language towards pseudo code]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This will be a "much turser and easier to navigate" form of software, moving away from impenetrable millions of lines of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This means people will move away from even seeing or thinking in traditional code, with an abstraction layer appearing as pseudo code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Crucially, the human will remain in the driver's seat, maintaining control and a fast iteration loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## [[Impact of AI tools on future product development skills | Evolving Skills for Engineers]]

In this "after code" world, certain skills will become increasingly valuable:

*   **Taste:** Michael emphasizes that "taste will be increasingly more valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. While often associated with visuals (UI/UX), taste in this context refers to having "the right idea for what should be built" and the effortless translation of that intent into functioning software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. It's less about the "how" and more about the "what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Logic Designer:** Being an engineer will increasingly feel like being a "logic designer," specifying exactly how everything should work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Less Careful:** While controversial, the future will allow engineers to be "less careful," a skill currently "incredibly incredibly important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This shifts focus from meticulousness to taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Vibe Coding and Control
"Vibe coding," where a lot of code is generated without fully understanding the details, currently leads to limitations, as users quickly reach a point where they can't change what they've created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The challenge is to give people continued control over all details even when they don't understand the underlying code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. AI's current limitation is that it often makes "unwieldy" decisions over which users lack control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Building Cursor: Lessons Learned

Cursor started as a solution search for a problem, born from reflecting on how AI would improve over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Origin Story
Two defining moments inspired Cursor:
1.  **GitHub Copilot:** Using the first beta version of GitHub Copilot was a revelation, as it was the first truly useful AI product the team encountered, and "one of the most useful if not the most useful dev tool we've ever adopted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
2.  **AI Scaling Papers:** Papers from OpenAI demonstrated that AI would improve simply by scaling models and data, even without new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

This led to the realization that [[ais_impact_on_skills_and_product_development | AI products were now possible]] and the technology would mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Michael observed that many were focused on making models but not "picking an area of knowledge work and thinking about what it was going to look like as AI got better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

Initially, the team worked on automating mechanical engineering, believing it would be "uncompetitive and sleepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. However, they lacked familiarity with the field, found it difficult to develop their own models, and realized they weren't passionate about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. They pivoted back to programming when they saw that the existing players weren't "sufficiently ambitious" about how "all of software creation was going to blow through these models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

### Choosing the IDE Path
Cursor decided to build an integrated development environment (IDE) rather than just an AI agent or a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. This decision was based on the belief that humans need "complete control over all the decisions" in the end tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. The team, as "intense realists" about current AI technology, knew that "the AI cannot do everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

Building an IDE, rather than a plugin for an existing environment, was crucial because the act of programming is expected to "change a lot over the course of the next few years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>, and existing environments have "so so so limited" extensibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Having control over the entire application is necessary for this evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

Future IDEs will allow users to move effortlessly between foreground (direct interaction) and background (AI spinning off work) modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Background processing is especially useful for tasks easy to specify, like bug fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

The challenge of AI agents is that users become "engineering managers" with many "not that smart" reports requiring significant reviewing, approving, and specifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. The solution for successful AI adoption is to "chop things up" into smaller, manageable tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>, allowing for frequent specification, AI work, and review cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

### [[Integration and Future of AI in Traditional Software Development | The Role of Custom Models]]
Counterintuitively, Cursor, despite initially not planning to, now does "a ton of model development" internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. Every "magic moment" in Cursor involves a custom model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. While they utilize large generative models (like GPT, Sonnet, Gemini), their custom models fill specific gaps:
*   **Cost and Speed:** For tasks like autocomplete, where foundation models are too slow or expensive, custom models provide completions within 300 milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. These models are specialized in autocompleting "a series of diffs" rather than generic text sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.
*   **Complementing Foundation Models:** Smaller, specialized models sit on both the input and output sides of big models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. They act as a "mini Google search" to find relevant codebase parts for big models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>, and then take the high-level suggestions from smart models to "fill in the details" and turn them into full code diffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. This ensemble approach pushes quality and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

### Growth and Success Factors
Cursor achieved historic growth, going from $0 to $100 million ARR in 20 months, and then $300 million ARR in just 2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.
Key factors in their success:
*   **Dogfooding:** The product development process was intensely focused on dogfooding, using the tool every day to ensure it was useful to themselves as engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Public Building:** The first hand-rolled prototype was built in five weeks, allowing the team to live on the editor full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. They launched to the world within three months of the first line of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>, aiming to "build in public quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. Initial user feedback led to basing Cursor on VS Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Sustained Paranoia and Focus:** Success stems from a "sustained paranoia" about how the product could improve, always feeling "very very far away" from the end goal of a new form of programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. The growth has been a "consistent exponential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>, driven by continuous improvement of the tool itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>, prioritizing product building over sales and marketing in early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Product Building:** Operating as a hybrid between a normal software company (building for millions of people) and a foundation model company (developing models for product quality) has been tricky but important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

### [[Strategies for futureproofing products in rapid tech advancement | Defensibility in AI]]
Michael sees defensibility in AI not as traditional moats like lock-in but as being "incumbent on us to continue to try to build the best thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. He compares the current market to early search engines or personal computers, where the "ceiling is incredibly high" and "you wouldn't run out of useful things to build" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. Continuous innovation and R&D economies of scale are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

He believes the market for tools that automate and augment knowledge work is "much bigger than people have realized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. While there will be many solutions, he predicts one company will eventually build the "general tool that builds almost all the world's software," becoming a "generationally big business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. Microsoft's Copilot, while an inspiration, struggles due to structural issues (market not friendly to incumbents) and historical reasons (original team moving on, coordination difficulties) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

### Staying Focused in a Rapidly Evolving Field
In a field with constant launches and chatter, staying focused is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>. Strategies include:
*   **Hiring Right:** Recruiting people with a "level-headed" disposition, less focused on external validation, and more on building quality work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.
*   **Open Communication:** Talking about the importance of focus a lot within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>.
*   **Leading by Example:** Management leading by example in their approach to new developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.
*   **Developing an "Immune System":** Over time, the team has built an "immune system" to discern which new developments actually matter for their business, recognizing that only a "very small number of these things really affect the business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.

## [[Impact of AI on software development and engineering roles | Future of Engineering Roles]]

### Benefits for Junior vs. Senior Engineers
AI tools like Cursor benefit both junior and senior engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Junior Engineers:** Tend to "go a little too wholesale relying on AI for everything," which isn't yet feasible for professional tools on large codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>.
*   **Senior Engineers:** On average, "underrate what AI can do for them and stick to their existing workflows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

To successfully use Cursor, users need to develop a "taste for what the models can do," including their complexity handling and specification requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. Tips for new users:
1.  **Chop up tasks:** Instead of expecting the model to handle a large task in one go, break it into smaller bits for better control and less disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>.
2.  **Experiment in safe environments:** Explicitly try to "fall on their face" and discover the limits of what models can do in side projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>. This helps build a gut feeling for the model's capabilities, which needs to be rebuilt with each new model launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

### [[Evolving team structures and management skills | Hiring for the Future]]
Michael admits that Cursor initially "hired too slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>, prioritizing patience in building a "world-class group of engineers and researchers" with intellectual curiosity, experimentation, and honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>.

Learnings in hiring include:
*   **Broadening Candidate Profiles:** Initially, they biased towards candidates from "well-known school[s]" who were "very young" and had "high credential" achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>. They found success with "later careered" individuals and young people who "look slightly different from... being straight out of central casting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.
*   **Evolved Interview Loop:** They now use hand-rolled interview questions and a core two-day onsite work test project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. This project allows candidates to go "end to end on a real project" in a mock setting, providing insights into their work product and team fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This process has scaled even as the company grew to nearly 60 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>, with a very high percentage of engineers, researchers, and designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.

### Continued Demand for Engineers
Despite AI's advancements, Michael believes engineers will continue to be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. He holds the view that there will be a "long messy middle" where humans remain in the driver's seat, deciding what software looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>. Engineers will be able to "do much more" due to the lasting demand for software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>. The current cost and labor intensity of building even simple software are high, and reducing this friction will unlock "tons and tons and tons of more stuff that we could do on our computers, tons more tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>. Thus, "long into the future, yes, there will actually be more demand for engineers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.

## [[The evolving landscape of AI technology | Misconceptions about AI's Impact]]

Michael believes people still misunderstand the pace and scope of AI's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. They tend to be at either extreme:
*   **Happening too fast:** Overestimating immediate capabilities and rapid, disruptive changes.
*   **Bluster and hype:** Underestimating the true long-term impact.

Instead, he asserts that we are in the middle of a "technology shift that's going to be incredibly consequential," more so than the internet or any shift since the advent of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. However, it "is going to take a while" – a "multi-decade thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. Progress requires knocking down many independent problems related to both model capabilities and how humans interact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.

Companies that focus on "automating and augmenting a particular area of knowledge work," building both the underlying technology and the product experience, will be highly consequential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. These successful companies will push technology forward at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.

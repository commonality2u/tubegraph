The distinction between a product owner and a product manager is often a source of confusion, particularly in organizations undergoing digital transformations. The product owner (PO) role, which is the third fastest-growing role in tech in the US, did not emerge from [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | product management]] as it is known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Instead, it originated from scrum as a way to help developers prioritize their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Melissa Perry, a prominent figure in the product management community and author of *Escaping the Build Trap*, highlights the critical differences and offers guidance for product owners aspiring to transition into product management roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## The Origins of the Product Owner Role

The [[the_role_and_evolution_of_the_product_owner_in_tech | product owner role in tech]] arose from the Agile movement, specifically from scrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The Agile Manifesto, written by software developers in 2001, aimed to improve software development processes, not necessarily product management as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The scrum guide, which outlines roles like the product owner, scrum master, and developers, was created to codify how teams should develop products, focusing on breaking down work into Sprints for faster feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

Initially, the scrum guide noted that for commercial development, the product owner *could* be the product manager, but for in-house development, it might be a user department manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. However, later versions of the scrum guide removed this distinction, leading to a common misconception that a product owner is inherently a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

Organizations, especially large companies not traditionally software-native (e.g., banks, insurance companies), adopted scrum and the product owner role through "Agile transformations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. These companies, seeking to build software faster and with more rigor, often turned to frameworks like Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

### Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)

SAFe emerged from the desire to scale scrum across large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. While executives at large enterprises often embrace SAFe due to its prescribed operating model for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>, Melissa Perry does not recommend using it, noting that successful implementers often "rip it up and make it into something else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.

A common issue with SAFe is its split of responsibilities:
*   **Product Owners** are typically part of the agile team, working with scrum masters and developers. Their primary focus becomes backlog management, writing user stories, and prioritizing work for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. This often turns them into "order takers" and makes their role highly tactical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
*   **Product Managers** in SAFe sit at a higher level, dealing with system architecture and release trains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. They are expected to conduct customer research and define what to build, then feed this to product owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>. This setup can leave product owners with little to no opportunity for strategic thinking or direct customer interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.

## Differentiating Product Owner and Product Manager Skills

The fundamental difference lies in their scope and focus:
*   **Product Owners (PO)**: Primarily focused on the "how" of building, ensuring the development team has a clear, prioritized backlog. Their training often emphasizes scrum mechanics, such as breaking down work, managing sprints, and running daily stand-ups and retrospectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. POs are typically accountable for maximizing the value of work done by the development team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **Product Managers (PM)**: Focused on the "what" and "why" â€“ understanding the market, customer needs, and business value to define the right product to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Key [[key_traits_of_successful_product_managers | skills of successful product managers]] include:
    *   Market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>
    *   Customer discovery and validation (talking to customers, testing ideas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>
    *   Developing hypotheses and iterating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
    *   Data analysis to inform decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>
    *   Strategic thinking and connecting product work to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>

## [[becoming_a_successful_product_manager | Transitioning from Product Owner to Product Manager]]

For product owners who find themselves in tactical roles, Melissa Perry offers several pieces of [[product_management_career_advice | product management career advice]]:

### 1. Shift Your Mindset and Proactively Engage
*   **Take Ownership**: Recognize that your role can be more than just working with developers. Push back on being an "order taker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.
*   **Ask Strategic Questions**: Engage leaders with questions like, "What's the goal here? What do we hope will happen when we release this? What metrics are we going to change?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>. This helps shift the focus from output to outcome.
*   **Seek Customer Interaction**: If your product manager handles customer research, ask to shadow them or participate in customer conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on Value**: Instead of merely managing a backlog, think about the value your team is delivering and if it's the right thing to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.

### 2. Understand and Advocate for Your Career Path
*   **Inquire About Career Ladders**: If there's no clear [[product_management_career_growth_framework | career path for product owners]], ask leaders what's next. This prompts the organization to think about how product owners can grow into more strategic roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.
*   **Self-Assess Skills**: Recognize that becoming a true product manager requires skills beyond scrum. If you lack experience in market research, customer discovery, or data analysis, seek opportunities to learn and apply these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

### 3. Tailor Your Resume for Product Management Roles
*   **Highlight Outcomes, Not Just Processes**: When describing your experience, focus on the value you delivered, the problems you solved for users, and the measurable impact on business metrics. Avoid emphasizing agile cadences or process-oriented tasks like "prioritized the backlog" or "wrote user stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.
*   **Use Product Manager Terminology**: Even with a product owner title, consider adding "Product Manager" to your resume title (e.g., "Product Owner/Product Manager") to signal your broader capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.
*   **Demonstrate Holistic Involvement**: Explain how you identified problems, conducted user research, collaborated with various teams (e.g., legal, compliance), and tracked the impact of your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

### 4. Reconsider Certifications (CSPO)
*   **Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO)**: While these certifications might help secure roles in organizations strictly following scrum/SAFe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>, they generally don't hold much weight with top tech companies looking for product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>. CSPO typically involves a two-day class that doesn't guarantee job readiness or the deep understanding needed for strategic product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>.
*   **Focus on Experience**: Real-world experience demonstrating product management skills is far more valuable than certifications for traditional PM roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

### 5. Influence Organizational Change or Seek New Opportunities
*   **Speak Up**: Product owners have the power to influence change by vocalizing their desire for more strategic roles and a clear career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. Organizations often respond to internal pressure, especially when losing good talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.
*   **Seek Mentorship**: Find leaders within your organization or externally who embody strong product management practices and learn from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>.
*   **Consider Lateral Moves**: In large corporations, explore moving to different business lines or divisions that demonstrate more mature product management practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.
*   **Evaluate Leaving**: If an organization consistently hinders your ability to practice true product management, it might be time to seek a different company that aligns with your career aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>.

## Organisational Role in Transformation

Leaders within organizations play a crucial role in enabling this transition and building robust [[hiring_and_roles_in_product_management | hiring and roles in product management]]. Instead of relying on rigid frameworks like SAFe, they should focus on developing a comprehensive product operating model that includes:
*   **Clear Product Strategy**: Defining how products tie back to company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.
*   **Organizational Design**: Structuring teams around products, ensuring good coverage and access to skilled product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.
*   **Product Operations**: Establishing infrastructure for data access, customer feedback, and user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
*   **Culture and Incentives**: Rewarding outcomes and value delivery, not just shipping features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   **[[coaching_and_mentoring_in_product_management | Coaching and Mentoring]]**: Bringing in experienced product leaders who can train and mentor less experienced team members, allowing internal talent to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.

Many large, non-software native companies are still early in their digital transformation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. While they may start with product owner roles, the ultimate goal should be to cultivate full-fledged product managers capable of end-to-end product responsibility. The absence of product owners in leading tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix, which all rely on product managers, underscores this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>.

Ultimately, successful transformation is not about rigid adherence to processes but about embracing the agile principles of moving quickly and delivering value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. It requires a commitment to continuous learning, strong leadership, and the development of skilled product professionals who can drive innovation and connect product efforts directly to business results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>.

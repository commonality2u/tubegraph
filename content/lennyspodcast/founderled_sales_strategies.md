[[importance_of_founderled_growth_strategies | Founder-led sales]] focuses on how a founder, in the early stages of a startup, directly engages with potential customers to secure initial sales and gather market insights. This approach is distinct from traditional sales processes and is crucial for early-stage companies aiming to achieve product-market fit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>

Jen AEL, co-founder of Jellyfish, specializes in helping early-stage founders learn how to sell, conduct early customer discovery, and establish a repeatable sales motion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> She emphasizes that founders often get tripped up by applying late-stage sales advice to their early-stage ventures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>

## The Importance of Founder-Led Sales

[[importance_of_founderled_growth_strategies | Founder-led sales]] is the initial commercial milestone for a startup, focusing on acquiring the first few customers, whether aiming for zero to one million in ARR or the first ten customers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>

In the very early days, without established brand equity, a functioning marketing engine, or customer references, **the founder *is* the product**. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> Founders possess unique, novel insights into a problem, stemming from their deep study and experience, which most of the market hasn't yet grasped or visualized. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> This novel insight and the founder's vision are what excite the market, even before a tangible product exists. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> The goal is to align the founder's vision with market reality. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>

Relying solely on hiring a salesperson too early is a common [[Mistakes Founders Make in Building Sales Teams | mistake founders make]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a> [[importance_of_founderled_growth_strategies | Founder-led sales]] offers a significant competitive advantage for several reasons: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>

*   **Visionary Communication:** No one can articulate the product's vision like the founder. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>
*   **Gravitas and Excitement:** The market is often eager to speak with a founder due to their unique knowledge and the potential for a different experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>
*   **Uncovering Insights:** Founders can identify "budding moments" in conversations that reveal critical market needs and help refine the go-to-market strategy, leading to product-market fit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> A founder's day-one market vision is rarely the same vision that leads to product-market fit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   **Direct Accountability:** Founder involvement removes the "game of telephone" where sales issues might be misattributed to salespeople rather than fundamental product or market problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>

Ultimately, [[importance_of_founderled_growth_strategies | founder-led sales]] is not about immediate revenue, but about learning as fast as humanly possible to understand the market's pulse and **earn the right to sell**. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a> The ideal milestone for founders to transition out of direct sales is around $500k to $1 million in ARR, especially if achieved quickly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>

## The Sales Cycle for Founders

The traditional sales stages often include an intro call, a second call (sometimes with a demo), a third call for proposals/scope of work, a fourth for feedback and co-authoring, a fifth for procurement introduction, and finally, obtaining the signature. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>

### 1. Getting Initial Attention: Outreach

How do you get someone to want to talk to you amidst a deluge of product emails? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>

*   **Founder's Weight:** When outreach comes from a founder, it carries different weight and encourages deeper engagement. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>
*   **Lead with Novel Insight:** Your technical or business model insight must lead the conversation. People are inspired by new ways of thinking, especially something counterintuitive or surprising, rather than just "better." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>
*   **Relevance over Personalization:** Focus on why the message is relevant to *their* role. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>
*   **Shock Value/Counterintuitive Angle:** Say something that makes them pause and think, "What?" or "I've never thought about it that way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>
*   **Conciseness:** Keep messages to three to four sentences maximum, ensuring it's readable on a mobile phone without scrolling. This also reflects an executive's writing style. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>
*   **Focus on the Problem (Not the Solution):** Leave them wanting more. Don't reveal everything; focus on the problem you aim to solve and why it needs solving now. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>
*   **Channels:** Cold email, LinkedIn DMs, and cold calling are effective channels. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a> Cold calling can have higher interest rates than email in some cases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>

#### Conversion Rates and Win Rates

*   **Win Rate vs. Conversion Rate:** A high win rate (e.g., 30-40% of leads converting to customers) means you need a lower conversion rate from initial outreach. If your win rate is low, you'll need a much higher conversion rate from outreach to get enough "at bats." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>
*   **Healthy Conversion Rates:** Mature outbound efforts typically see 5-7% conversion. Founder outreach can be higher (8-15%) if solving a hard-felt problem. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>
*   **Problem-Driven Interest:** When a problem is genuinely felt by the market, people will respond and get on calls, regardless of perceived "email doesn't work anymore" narratives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a> If interest rates are low, it might indicate your message isn't interesting, the problem isn't widely felt, or your perspective needs refinement. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>

#### Finding Leads

Before using complex tools, manually find 30 people you are deeply excited to learn from and are willing to invest 15-20 minutes in writing a thoughtful, rock-solid note. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>

*   **Discoverability:** Are these people easily discoverable? Difficulty finding 30 prospects is an early signal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>
*   **Commonalities:** Look for patterns among the 30 people (e.g., team size, industry, role tenure, previous roles). This helps identify parameters for broader campaigns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>
*   **Natural Experiments:** If no one responds to your 30 personalized notes, it forces you to question whether to change the messaging or target a different role. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>
*   **Volume After Validation:** Volume should only come once you've identified and understood your target parameters. This allows for effective use of enrichment tools like Clay. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>

### 2. The First Sales Call: Engagement

Once you're on the phone, the goal is to get them to engage further.

*   **Vulnerability and Honesty:** Be open and honest about your early stage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>
    *   Example: "Hey, I'm an early-stage startup. We're deeply passionate about solving this specific problem. We have a lot to learn here. Here's how we are thinking about it from a problem priority perspective. Can we gain your insight into how this problem is manifesting on your side?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>
*   **Seeking Insight, Not Selling:** If you claim to have a fully baked product, you won't get honest feedback. Being vulnerable allows prospects to give raw, honest feedback because it's easier to tell someone *before* they build it that you don't care about a feature. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>
*   **Focus on Learning:** [[importance_of_founderled_growth_strategies | Founder-led sales]] prioritizes learning as fast as humanly possible to earn the right to sell. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>
*   **Avoid Early Demos:** The demo is your "only carrot." Don't show everything on the first call. Let them visualize the solution in their head, then use the demo on a second call to deepen their investment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>
*   **Questioning for Aha! Moments:** Ask questions that uncover both *your* and *their* "aha!" moments. Encourage them to describe how the solution would look in their head. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>
*   **Booking the Next Call:** Always book the second call while still on the first call. Pull up calendars and suggest inviting relevant colleagues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a> If they say "I'll email you," it's often a polite way of saying they're not interested. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>
*   **What Not to Ask:** Avoid generic questions like "What keeps you up at night?" or "What are your pain points?" as answers change daily. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>

### 3. Identifying Product-Market Fit Signals

Look for these signs during initial conversations:

*   **Growing/Widening Problem:** The problem must be increasing in scope, not a fixed issue that's no longer a priority. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>
*   **Measured/Managed Problem:** Ask if they are currently measuring or managing this problem. If they don't know or say no, it's a powerful signal that there isn't much urgency. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>
*   **Prior Attempts to Solve:** Understand their maturity in trying to solve the problem (e.g., hiring headcount, using other tools, or if it's an open gap). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>
*   **Bringing in Colleagues:** A key sign of momentum is when prospects suggest bringing in other people (e.g., their boss, potential users) for subsequent calls. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>

### 4. Co-Authoring Proposals and Offering Services

Early on, customers get excited if they feel the solution is being built specifically for them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a> Co-authoring the scope of work allows you to turn a customer into a guide. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>

*   **Buyer Maturity:** Co-authorship reveals their buyer maturity. If they lack an existing process or strategy for the problem, they likely can't buy a technology solution yet. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>
*   **Selling Services First:** In such cases, sell a service first. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>
    *   **Benefits:** You get paid to educate them, design their process, gain a logo, and show revenue/intent to investors (even if not recurring SaaS revenue). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a> This sets the mindset with the buyer for how your solution fits. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>
    *   **Timeboxing:** Timebox service agreements to 90-day increments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>
    *   **Example:** Helping a traditional industry customer understand how to integrate a new technology into their workflow, or even building a custom sales pitch for them to present internally. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a> This acts as a consulting engagement that leads towards product acquisition. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>
    *   **Prevalence:** 40-50% of B2B SaaS startups, especially those selling top-down where the user and buyer are different, need to sell some form of service before the technology. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>

### 5. Navigating Procurement

Procurement teams are professional, smart buyers. You need to sell them too. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>

*   **Simplicity and Differentiation:** Don't overcomplicate things or use jargon. Make your offering feel distinctly different from existing vendors, as it's easier for procurement to default to preferred providers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>
*   **Do the Work for Them:** Make their job easy. Offer to fill out forms and proactively provide information. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>
*   **Clear Classification:** Clearly explain what your product does and doesn't do. If procurement cannot classify you, they might categorize you as "high risk," leading to demanding contracts (e.g., $5M insurance, book inspection). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>
*   **Truncate Contracts:** Consider separating technology and service contracts. A service contract can get you onboarded and allow you to educate users while the technology contract navigates longer procurement processes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>
*   **Understand Signatories:** Before the final stage, know who the actual signatory is (CFO, Legal, Business Unit Head, Head of Procurement). Prepare a concise summary for them to understand what they are signing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>
*   **Payment Condition:** Do not start work until the contract is signed by procurement and approved by finance. Business units cannot pay you directly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>

### 6. Getting the Signature

Once you get a signature, celebrate! <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>

*   **Value of Getting In:** Getting into an Enterprise company means you are now a preferred vendor, with the ability to cross-sell to other business units. You gain a competitive advantage and invaluable internal intel. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>
*   **Compounding Effects:** A $100k deal can become $500k next year, and a $500k deal can become $1 million the year after. This is where growth truly accelerates. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>
*   **Trust is Key:** If you are a trusted salesperson or founder, your market will continually send you leads and word-of-mouth referrals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a> Don't sell something just to secure a logo if it won't truly solve their problem, as this will lead to churn. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>

### Sales Timelines and ACV

*   **Factors:** Sales cycle length depends on the founder's project management, the organization's complexity (e.g., regulated industries), budget availability, problem pain, and the seniority of the contact. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>
*   **Enterprise Timelines:** Enterprise deals can range from 90 days (rare) to typically 6-12 months. Highly regulated industries may take 9-12 months conservatively. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>
*   **Value of Enterprise:** Enterprises understand that the effort (time and complexity) to get a deal done can cost more than the technology itself, which is why they are willing to spend so much. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>
*   **Sweet Spot ACV:** For an early-stage startup selling to enterprise, a good Annual Contract Value (ACV) to start with is $50k-$200k, with $50k-$100k being a common initial contract range. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>
*   **Discounting:** Discounting should be for a specific reason (e.g., design partner, long-term reference) and not merely to close a deal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>

### Choosing Your Market: SMB vs. Enterprise

Founders must decide which market to play in. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>

*   **Small Business (SMB):** The user and buyer are often the same, making sales more streamlined. However, churn is a significant challenge as SMBs can cancel quickly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a> This is a marketing-intensive, high-volume game. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>
*   **Mid-Market:** This can be a "funky place" as it straddles high-value enterprise and high-volume SMB strategies. Mid-market companies often lack the internal resources for heavy integration, relying on third-party consultants, which adds complexity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>
*   **Enterprise:** Sales are more complex but offer compounding growth effects and deeper insights. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>

The choice depends on:
*   Who the product was built for. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>
*   Where the problem is most acutely felt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>
*   Which go-to-market "game" the founder wants to play for the next 10 years of their life. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>

### Common Pitfalls and Key Takeaways

*   **Top of Funnel Problem:** Most perceived "bottom of funnel" sales problems are actually top-of-funnel issues related to poor qualification, wrong messaging, not solving the right problem, or lacking differentiation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>
*   **Sales Should Be Fun:** Sales calls should feel invigorating for the buyer, giving them new insights and potentially leading to internal influence or promotion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:25">[01:11:25]</a> Founders should bring passion and energy to their calls. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>
*   **Believe in Your Solution:** It's hard to sell something you don't believe in. Ensure your solution genuinely addresses the customer's problem and be honest if it's not the right fit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>
*   **Trust as Currency:** Trust is the number one currency in sales. Being a trusted founder or salesperson leads to continuous leads and word-of-mouth referrals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>

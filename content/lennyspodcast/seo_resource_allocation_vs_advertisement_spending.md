Many companies frequently misallocate resources by underfunding Search Engine Optimization (SEO) while overspending on advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This imbalance is particularly illogical for large entities like Zillow or eBay, which might invest tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars in ads but only a fraction of that, perhaps fifty thousand dollars, in SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>. The traffic generated by a robust [[role_and_hiring_strategies_for_seo_experts | SEO team]] could be equivalent to that gained through massive ad expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>.

## Strategic Resource Allocation

When deciding on resource allocation, companies should evaluate the cost and opportunity of SEO in comparison to all other potential channels, such as paid advertising or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. It's crucial to assess if [[evaluating_when_to_invest_in_seo_for_startups | SEO is the right growth channel]] to focus on at a given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

For instance:
*   If paid advertising campaigns are performing exceptionally well, it might not be immediately worthwhile to divert significant investment into SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
*   Similarly, if direct brand efforts (like those by Airbnb) are highly effective, prioritizing brand investment might make more sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.

The decision to invest in SEO should be framed as an ROI question, weighing the cost of generating content (e.g., each article in [[seo_best_practices_and_content_strategy | editorial SEO]]) against the expected returns, and comparing this with the cost and returns of other channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. This comprehensive comparison helps in determining the most effective allocation of budget and speed of investment across different growth levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>.

> "Of all the things I could be working on how does SEO compare with all of my alternative things that I could focus on and then what's the scope of that so do I want to spend my money on that or do I want to spend it on something else with that amount of money does that make sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>

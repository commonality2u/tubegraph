Marily Nika, a product lead at Meta focusing on metaverse avatars and identity, and a former Google employee working on Google Glass, computer vision, and speech recognition, shares insights on the [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | impact of AI on business and technology]], particularly for product managers (PMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Identifying Problems Before Adopting AI
It's crucial to avoid the "shiny object trap" by not adopting AI for its own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead, identify a specific problem or pain point that needs a smart solution first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Only after defining the problem and a high-level solution should companies explore how to implement AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. An AI PM's role is to solve the right problem, which then involves determining if a data scientist should create a model for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>.

## [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | Impact of AI on Business and Technology]]
Marily believes that in the future, "everything will be AI by default" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. [[role_of_ai_in_enhancing_and_transforming_software_development | AI enhances human work]], rather than replacing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The technology can enhance the human experience and unlock new areas of product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:41">[02:23:41]</a>.

### [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | Impact of AI on Product Management]]
It's predicted that all product managers will eventually become [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development_roles | AI product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This is driven by the need for personalized experiences, effective recommender systems (e.g., Netflix), and continuous automation improvements in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

PMs will need to become comfortable partnering with research scientists who can produce smart models for automation, personalization, and recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Many PMs are accustomed to predictable product launches, but AI development involves uncertainty and research that might not yield immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. Adaptability to this uncertainty is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

## [[using_ai_tools_for_product_management_and_development | Using AI Tools for Product Management and Development]]
AI tools can significantly improve a PM's job performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
Examples of how AI, specifically ChatGPT, can assist PMs:
*   **Mission Statement Creation** ChatGPT can generate mission statements that are universally understandable and inspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **User Segmentation** AI can propose user segments, motivations, and pain points that a human might not consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Idea Generation** It can provide ideas for AI-enhanced features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## [[role_of_ai_in_software_development | Role of AI in Software Development]] and Product Enhancement
AI can be "sprinkled in" to existing products to make them smarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>. Potential enhancements include:
*   Increased security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>
*   Personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>
*   Fraud detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>
*   Ethical considerations (e.g., in healthcare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>
*   Improved speed and accuracy (e.g., in shopping recommendations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>

Any product where data can be collected on user behavior can be improved with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. The first step for companies is often to ensure they are collecting and analyzing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

### When Not to Use AI
AI should not be used for Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:44">[01:44:44]</a>. It's inefficient to use data scientists and powerful machines for an MVP, which is meant to validate an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:44">[01:48:44]</a>. Instead, fake the AI functionality with a Figma prototype for user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:44">[01:54:44]</a>. AI should be applied when there's existing data, possibly from an adjacent product, that can be leveraged to create a meaningful feature like recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

### Data Requirements
The amount of data needed for AI/ML depends on the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Simple classification tasks (e.g., cat vs. dog photos) might only need 15-20 labeled photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. However, complex applications like voice recognizers or natural language processing (NLP) require thousands of data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. It can be challenging to find or even synthesize sufficient data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

Startups often lack sufficient data to build their own models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Large companies, especially those offering services like speech recognition, benefit from training models with more diverse data to differentiate their quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## [[the_role_and_evolution_of_ai_models_in_product_development | The Role and Evolution of AI Models in Product Development]]
### What is an AI Model?
An AI model can be thought of as a "kid's brain" that learns from repeated information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Just as a child learns to identify animals after seeing them multiple times, a model takes an input (like an image or audio) and outputs a recognition with a probability of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This input can be text, video, or voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### Training a Model
Training a model involves providing large datasets (thousands) of labeled information, such as images of cats and dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The model processes this information, identifies patterns, and learns how to identify specific things without explicit rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. The output of training can be a transcription (e.g., voice to text) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

### Cool Applications
One notable application is the real-time language translation feature of Google Glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. The glass could take audio from a speaker of one language, transcribe and translate it, and display it on the screen for a user speaking a different language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. This technology demonstrates the ability of AI devices to break down communication barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

Another example is using drones to take photos of wind turbines, which are then uploaded to an AI tool to identify which turbines need maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. This reduced maintenance time from weeks to hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

## Developing Skills for AI Product Management
For PMs looking to grow in AI, it's advised to:
*   **Don't Be Overwhelmed** [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development_roles | PMs don't need to code or train models]] themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. No-code approaches exist for training models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Understand Fundamentals** Learning the basics of coding and how AI tools are created provides confidence and a deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Resources like Coursera (Stanford's "Introduction to AI"), CareerFoundry, General Assembly, and Coding Dojo offer online courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Shadow Researchers** If working at a company with AI researchers, spend time talking to and observing them to understand their work and the potential of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Hands-on Experience** Engage in projects to build AI products from end-to-end, even if it's just a proof of concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Tools like Google Cloud's AutoML allow users to train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal effort, even without coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### Challenges in AI Product Management
*   **Uncertainty**: Research-based AI projects involve inherent uncertainty. Model results may not always align with initial hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Change Management**: Leading and managing change for a team in uncertain research environments can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Data Collection**: Obtaining high-quality data is difficult and requires creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
*   **Career Trajectory**: Traditional PM career progression often relies on frequent launches. In AI research, launches may be less frequent, requiring clear discussions with hiring managers about assessment and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## Gaining Buy-in for AI Investments
To secure investment for AI projects, leverage examples of successful adjacent products within the company that were AI-first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Propose a "kill switch" and a rollback plan to de-risk the investment and demonstrate that potential negative impact is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. A company culture that embraces failure can also encourage such big bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

It's common for initial [[role_of_ai_in_enhancing_and_transforming_software_development | AI/ML investments]] to have low ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. However, with more public models and advanced tooling, it's becoming easier to integrate AI and see useful results in a shorter timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## Staying Updated on AI Trends
To stay current with [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_and_technology | AI and machine learning]], subscribe to newsletters like "The Download" by MIT Technology Review or tldr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Additionally, follow academia and research blogs, such as arXiv, where new papers and breakthroughs (like ChatGPT) often first appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. The increasing investment by companies in bridging the gap between academic research and product commercialization is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. PMs play a vital role in taking research ideas and finding ways to monetize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

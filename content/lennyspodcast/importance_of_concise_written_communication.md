Effective communication, particularly in written form, is a crucial skill for product leaders and anyone in a leadership role, or those aiming to advance their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:19">[04:54:19]</a>. Poor communication can lead to confusion, skepticism, apathy, and avoidable questions, significantly impacting team efficiency and project outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Defining Conciseness

Conciseness is often misunderstood as simply being brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. However, it is not about the absolute word count, but rather the economy of words and the density of the insight being shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. A thousand-word memo can be "tight and concise," while a three-hundred-word memo can be "meandering and long-winded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The core of conciseness lies in clarity of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

## The "Blast Radius" of Poor Communication

A poorly written memo or message can have a much larger negative impact than many people realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. If a message in a Slack channel with fifteen people is confusing or lacks necessary information, it leads to significant "back and forth," hindering productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. Taking a moment to ensure clarity can enable recipients to move forward efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

## Achieving Conciseness

The consistent solution to being concise is **preparation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

### Preparation and Clarity of Thought
The primary bottleneck to conciseness is often a lack of clarity in one's own thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. Advice like "don't bury the lead" or "cut to the chase" assumes one already knows their core point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. Just as someone is concise when telling a familiar story because they know all the "beats," clarity about the message's core point is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

For both meetings and writing, even a few minutes of preparation can make a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Before a meeting, considering "why am I in this meeting? What do I want to share and make sure I get across?" helps focus and enables conciseness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. For writing, simply reminding oneself to be concise often leads to significant trimming and tidying of sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. Asking "how might I be adding cognitive load?" can reveal opportunities to simplify and clarify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

### Reviewing and Editing
It is crucial to review what has been written at least once before sharing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. This simple act can significantly reduce issues, including typos, grammar errors, and unnecessary words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

### Avoiding Excessive Formatting
Overusing formatting, such as bolding, can negate its purpose. If too much text is bolded, nothing stands out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. Using formatting sparingly is a good rule of thumb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

### The Pitfalls of Sentence Fragments
While bullets and sentence fragments might seem faster and more concise, they often require the reader to decipher and interpret the meaning, ultimately taking longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. Relying on fragments can also be a "crutch," as turning them into complete sentences often reveals if the idea was fully thought out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. This aligns with the "Amazon six-page memo" philosophy, where writing out an idea in prose helps crystallize thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

## Broader Impact of Concise Communication

Investing a little more time upfront in communication is an "investment" that can save significant time later by preventing follow-up questions and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>. Small improvements in communication compound to make a big difference in overall work quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. People often claim diminishing returns too early, but focusing on fundamental skills like communication, which others might consider "boring or too basic," can yield significant advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.

> "I often see operators who explain things poorly and then are shocked and horrified when people are confused or there's skepticism, there's apathy. I'm a big proponent of asking myself, if I'm not getting the reaction that I'm looking for, how might I be contributing? How could I explain this more clearly? How can I be more compelling? How can I anticipate any questions that they might have?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

This self-reflection is key to improving communication and achieving desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. As Wes Ko, a communication teacher, emphasizes, the impact of improved communication is that "people receiving my ideas better...ideas that used to be locked in my head that I would get frustrated that no one else understood, people were now understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

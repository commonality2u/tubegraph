## Underestimated Value of Celebrations

Some CEOs initially believe that starting OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) is the priority. However, experience shows that even without formal OKRs, implementing regular Friday celebrations can lead to immediate and noticeable positive changes within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

## Impact on Teams and Culture

The core benefit of celebrations lies in their ability to foster a sense of belonging and excitement:
*   **Feeling Valued** The simple act of gathering and asking, "what was the most awesome thing that happened to you this week?" makes individuals feel like they are part of something truly special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. This includes successes in different departments like marketing or design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.
*   **Excitement and Engagement** Celebrations contribute to a "super exciting" atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, promoting a positive [[the_role_of_organizational_culture_in_experimentation_success | organizational culture]] and encouraging continued effort.

## Integrating Celebrations into Your Cadence

A healthy organizational cadence can incorporate celebration as a regular ritual:
*   **Weekly Commitment and Celebration** A recommended practice involves a weekly rhythm: Mondays are for committing to actions, and Fridays are for celebrating accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Positive** During Friday celebrations, the emphasis is on sharing "the most awesome thing that happened" to individuals or within departments that week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. This simple act reinforces positive outcomes and strengthens team bonds.

Maggie Crowley, VP of Product at Toast, highlights key traits of successful Product Managers (PMs) and offers actionable strategies for simplifying and prioritizing tasks, emphasizing execution and ownership over traditional metrics or roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Product Manager Mindset: Beyond "Not My Job"

A crucial characteristic of effective PMs is their willingness to tackle tasks that might not technically be "their job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While such tasks may belong to someone else, successful PMs "just get over and get the work done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This proactive approach leads to faster progress, more successful products, and reduces frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

PMs often serve as the "emotional center of the team," responsible for maintaining motivation, excitement, and buy-in for a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This requires sustained optimism and a readiness to "do whatever it takes," whether that involves hopping on a sales call or assisting a customer with implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Core Threads Across the Best Product Managers

Drawing from her experience hiring and managing PMs, Maggie Crowley identifies three consistent traits among the most effective product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>:

1.  **Simplifying and Breaking Things Down**: The ability to identify the single most important task and stick with it until completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
2.  **Following Up on Results**: Consistently checking and sharing the impact of shipped features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
3.  **Carrying the Water**: Willingness to engage in the less glamorous, "boring" work necessary for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

These traits, she argues, differentiate great PMs from those who merely possess foundational skills like communication, analytical ability, or user experience intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. While strategy is vital, it represents a small fraction of a PM's work, with actual impact stemming from shipping and executing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Strategies for Simplifying and Prioritizing

Simplification, often synonymous with prioritization, is a challenging but critical skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. It's not just about making a decision, but "the ability to stay with it and to make sure that it continues to be the most important thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

*   **Written Communication**:
    *   **Read Aloud**: When writing, read your text aloud to identify overly complicated or nonsensical passages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
    *   **"Just Say That"**: Express what you mean directly, avoiding overly formal or complex prose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   **Cut Excess**: Be ruthless in removing unnecessary words; "pretty much every doc you write, you can delete the first two paragraphs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
    *   **[[Product Management methodologies | Minto Pyramid Principle]]**: Place your main conclusion or headline first, followed by supporting arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
    *   **Rule of Three**: Limit strategies, conclusions, or next steps to a maximum of three main points to aid comprehension and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

*   **Focus and Impact**:
    *   **Pick "The Thing"**: Avoid lumping too many ideas together, which dilutes efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Focus on the one thing that will have the most impact and eliminate less important items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
    *   **Confidence in Decisions**: [[Decision making in product management | Getting to the one thing you should do]] is difficult, requiring confidence in your choice and the willingness to say no to other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

*   **Feedback and Learning**:
    *   **Seek Review**: Have others review your work and genuinely listen to their feedback to help you simplify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
    *   **Peer Groups**: Form small, non-competitive peer groups (e.g., via Slack) to exchange work for review and discuss challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### [[Executing strategy effectively in product management | Executing Strategy Effectively]]

The most effective PMs "ship more stuff, get more reps, and has the ability to actually create impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

*   **Following Up on Results**:
    *   **Calendar Reminders**: Set reminders to check metrics and dashboards weeks or months after a product launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Share Progress**: Proactively share results with managers and stakeholders to ensure your work is recognized and to learn from outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. This builds trust, creating an "aura" that you "got this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
    *   **Continuous Learning**: Regularly reviewing results helps PMs understand *why* something happened (or didn't), leading to continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. "The more you ship, the more you learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

*   **Carrying the Water (Doing the Unglamorous Work)**:
    *   **"When in doubt, it's your job"**: Unlike engineers or designers with clear deliverables, PMs are responsible for achieving business results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. This means filling any gaps to ensure the problem is solved for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.
    *   **Embrace "Bullshit Work"**: The PM role is often not glamorous and involves mundane but necessary tasks like [[Challenges with project management roles in product teams | project management]], QA, customer support, sales, and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. "None of it is above you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

### The Value of Deep Product Experience

Building expertise as a PM takes time, often several years, because it requires shipping a lot of products and learning from the consequences of decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. Staying with a company or product for extended periods (e.g., 3-4 years) allows PMs to observe multiple product cycles and gain deeper insights, which can accelerate career progression later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

[[Identifying high leverage tasks for product managers | The most impactful work for a PM]] is often about taking responsibility and making bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. "You have to be willing to take responsibility and it's your job to pick the thing and it's your job to be accountable to your team for picking the thing so you better get it right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

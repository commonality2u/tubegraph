When approaching [[prototyping_and_experimenting_with_ai | AI in product development]], it's crucial to avoid what is known as the "shiny object trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This trap refers to the tendency to implement AI simply for the sake of using AI, rather than to solve a specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Focus on the Problem, Not Just the Technology

Instead of doing AI for AI's sake, product teams should ensure there is a clear problem or pain point that needs a smart solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Only once this problem and a high-level solution have been identified should teams consider how to implement it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Marily Nika, a product lead at Meta, emphasizes that an [[ai_in_product_management | AI product manager]] (AI PM) helps their team and company solve the *right* problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This means identifying a problem for which a data scientist can create a model, ensuring there is an audience, a user, and a pain point for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## When Not to Use AI

A key indicator that AI may not be the right approach is when it's considered for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

> "Don't do it for your MVP, it makes zero sense. Do not waste time of data scientists that can train models with us using powerful machines that are going to take weeks to train." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>

If the goal is to gain buy-in for an idea or feature that *might* use AI in the future, it's more efficient to "fake it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This can involve creating a Figma prototype to show users what the AI would do, without actually building the complex AI system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

Many early-stage entrepreneurs mistakenly believe they need to train an AI model to prove market existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. However, AI should be used in situations where there is already existing data, or data from an adjacent product, that can be leveraged to create something meaningful like recommendations or personalizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

> [!tip] AI is not for MVPs!
> Do not use AI to prove a market for a new product. Instead, use existing data or data from adjacent products to enhance an already meaningful product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

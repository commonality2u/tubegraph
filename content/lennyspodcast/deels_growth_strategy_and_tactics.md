Deel, a global payroll, HR, and compliance platform, has experienced remarkably rapid growth, moving from less than a million dollars in ARR in July 2020 to $295 million ARR by the start of 2023, while also remaining EBITDA positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. This trajectory has led to Deel being considered arguably the fastest-growing SaaS business of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Melton Quran Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, joined the company as the second marketing hire and 19th or 20th employee overall, leading all growth efforts including paid ads, product marketing, content, and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Foundational Growth Principles
In the [[challenges_and_strategies_in_earlystage_startup_growth | early days]] of a company, it's crucial to "go back to the basics" and "build the skeleton before you put on the makeup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. For Deel, this meant ensuring fundamental elements were solid before investing heavily in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

Key foundational steps include:
*   **Website Presence and Performance**: Having a fast website that search engines recognize and that provides a good user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A website loading in four-plus seconds makes a successful paid ads program impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Clear Messaging**: Ensuring the website's copy clearly explains what the company does, avoiding generic statements that could apply to any business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Operational Readiness**: Moving the website to an easily editable platform allowed for continuous A/B testing and rapid iteration of value propositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

## Cheaper Growth Channels
Deel's early growth was kickstarted by investing in low-cost channels, particularly those where people actively seek solutions to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. The core philosophy is to "add value to people, answer their questions" without directly trying to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

### Community Engagement (e.g., Reddit, Quora)
Deel actively engages in communities where potential users ask questions, such as Reddit and Quora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Set up alerts for keywords related to their services (e.g., HR, international hiring) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. When a question is asked, a team member provides a helpful, value-added answer, and then, if appropriate, introduces Deel's solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Execution**: This process is never automated and involves team members, including co-founders, directly engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.
*   **Impact**: While individual community interactions might seem small, they combine with word-of-mouth and have a lasting digital presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. This channel contributed significantly in the [[new_company_approach_and_the_shift_from_traditional_growth_strategies | early days]] (around 15% of the funnel initially) and continues to grow the net number of people reached, even as its percentage of the overall funnel has reduced to under 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.
*   **Other Channels**: This approach extends to social channels like Twitter, and closed communities such as Slack groups or Y Combinator communities, where adding value is paramount to avoid being kicked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

### Content and SEO
[[growth_hacking_and_strategies | Content]] and SEO have been crucial for Deel's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Philosophy**: The primary goal is to write content that completely answers a user's question, so "the Google search is over" after reading the article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. This is prioritized over simply stuffing keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
*   **Example**: Articles explaining "what an EOR is and isn't" are highly effective because they address user intent and anticipate follow-up questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>.
*   **Operational Framework (Traffic Light System)**:
    1.  Identify up to 700 keywords related to Deel's services, ranging from closely to distantly related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>.
    2.  Rank keywords by volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.
    3.  Assess the intent of someone searching for each keyword:
        *   **Green Light**: High intent, likely customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>.
        *   **Yellow Light**: Moderate intent, 50/50 chance of conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.
        *   **Red Light**: Low intent, not looking to buy (e.g., a university student doing research) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>.
    4.  Prioritize content creation for green light keywords (highest volume first), then yellows, often never reaching reds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>.
*   **Content Creation Process**:
    *   Understand search intent by observing what Google currently serves and checking "people also ask" sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>.
    *   Use SEO tools (like Clearscope) to ensure content is simple to read (e.g., 5th-grade reading level) and keywords are correctly placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>.
*   **Team Structure**: An eight-person content team, led by a Director of Content (an early Deel employee), with one person focused on operations (managing freelancers, fact-checking, publishing) and others specializing in different product lines or new content mediums (video, education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>.
*   **Volume**: The team publishes around five new articles and five article updates per week, often in multiple languages, due to constantly changing regulations and taxes in global HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.
*   **Applicability**: SEO is most suited for B2B products solving an active problem, where users actively search for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a>.

### Partnerships
Strategic partnerships focus on entities that are trusted resources for the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:14:00">[35:14:00]</a>.
*   **Example**: Partnering with Venture Capital (VC) firms is highly effective because startups often ask their VCs for platform recommendations when expanding their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>. This is prioritized over partnerships with companies that simply share an audience but are not a trusted source for problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54:00">[35:54:00]</a>.

## Paid Ads Strategy
After establishing foundational elements and cheaper channels, Deel invests in paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>.
*   **Prerequisites**: A fast website and clear messaging are essential before launching paid ad campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: Beyond major platforms (Google, Facebook), Deel invests in "long tail" placements such as review sites, smaller niche outlets, newsletter ads, and podcast ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a>. Individually, these may not contribute much, but collectively they can account for ~30% of lead flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>.
*   **Creative Refresh**: To combat creative fatigue, ad creatives are updated monthly (with the exception of some Google ads that need to be straightforward) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:45:00">[40:45:00]</a>. Messaging is continuously aligned with product evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:58:00">[40:58:00]</a>.
*   **Full-Funnel Measurement**: Deel tracks not just leads generated but also conversion rates from lead to qualified opportunity to closed-won client, and the average revenue generated from those clients one year out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[41:10:00]</a>. This helps determine appropriate customer acquisition cost and investment levels for each channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>.

## The Product's Role in Growth
Underlying all [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth strategies]] is the fundamental importance of a great product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:15:00">[42:15:00]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Acquisition channels are ineffective if the product doesn't meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>. In the B2B world, poor products lead to churn and negative word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:22:00">[43:22:00]</a>.
*   **Deel's Experience**: Deel's product was "top-notch" from day one, so much so that early messaging sometimes had to be "tampered down" because people didn't believe the product could do all it claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:40:00">[42:40:00]</a>.
*   **Hiring Insight**: A sign of a strong product-centric company is a high ratio of product and engineering hires to sales hires in the [[new_company_approach_and_the_shift_from_traditional_growth_strategies | early stages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a>.

## Impact of COVID-19
While Deel was founded before the pandemic, COVID-19 accelerated a shift towards remote work, effectively acting as a "pilot program" for Deel's vision of global work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:41:00">[44:41:00]</a>. Deel is a "global work platform," not just a remote work platform, enabling companies to hire globally regardless of office presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:28:00">[45:28:00]</a>. This environment led to significant organic interest and word-of-mouth as businesses needed solutions for international hiring and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:30:00">[46:30:00]</a>.

## Team Building and Culture for Growth
Melton's approach to team building for growth focuses on accountability, resourcefulness, and a strong culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>.

### Hiring Philosophy
*   **Revenue Commitment**: Candidates are expected to commit to closed-won revenue KPIs, not just lead numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:31:00">[47:31:00]</a>. This is assessed by looking at past roles and asking how they would approach strategy with varying budgets (e.g., zero, $10k, $100k) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:11:00">[50:11:00]</a>.
*   **"Little Hands" Mentality**: Employees, regardless of seniority, must be willing to do the "nitty-gritty work" and not shy away from small tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:46:00">[48:46:00]</a>. This prevents leaders from relying solely on building teams for every task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:03:00">[49:03:00]</a>.
*   **Startup Fit**: Avoid hiring senior leaders from large companies who are accustomed to abundant resources, unless they demonstrate a willingness to operate with limited resources and "do the Dirty Work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:22:00">[48:22:00]</a>.

### Team Structure
*   **Early Growth Team (Functional Focus)**:
    1.  **Product Marketing Lead**: Set messaging and bridged product with go-to-market teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:47:00">[51:47:00]</a>.
    2.  **Copywriter**: Led creative teams and supported messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:02:00">[52:02:00]</a>.
    3.  **Data Analyst**: Hired as the third person to ensure every dollar spent was tracked and understood, a priority for Deel's data-driven approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:10:00">[52:10:00]</a>.
*   **Current Structure (Functional and Regional)**:
    *   **Functional Teams**: Subject matter experts (e.g., product marketing, content, community, events, paid ads, brand) sit together to foster best practice sharing and skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:52:00">[52:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Regional Teams**: Marketing managers in key regions work with functional teams to localize and execute strategies based on market opportunities and competitive landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:17:00">[53:17:00]</a>.

### Company Culture
Deel's culture is shaped by mutual expectations between the company and its team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:13:00">[55:13:00]</a>.
*   **Expected from Team Members**:
    *   **"Deal Speed"**: Acting with urgency to solve customer problems quickly (e.g., 24-hour response times, rapid product development) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:28:00">[55:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Default Optimism**: Maintaining a positive outlook and focusing on "how can this be done" rather than why it won't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:09:00">[56:09:00]</a>.
    *   **Customer Care**: Recognizing the personal impact of Deel's services on human livelihoods (payroll, legal compliance) and treating customers with deep care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:35:00">[56:35:00]</a>.
*   **Given by Company**:
    *   **Flexibility**: Employees have the freedom to choose where and when they work, fostering authenticity and work-life integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:23:00">[57:23:00]</a>.
*   **Values Evolution**: Core values like "Deal Speed" emerged organically from frequently used phrases and were formally defined about a year into the company's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:08:00">[58:08:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways
Growth, while seemingly complex, is "relatively straightforward" when focusing on first principles: identifying target audiences, adding genuine value, and ensuring a strong product backs up any promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. It requires significant discipline to execute consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.

Ramp, recognized as the fastest-growing SaaS business in history, achieved over $100 million in annual run rate within two years, operating with fewer than 50 people in its R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, including less than 40 engineers and three Product Managers (PMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This rapid success is attributed to an organizational approach that prioritizes velocity, operates from first principles, and empowers individual team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

## The Culture of Velocity

At Ramp, velocity is central to its product development process, influencing how teams are incentivized, talent is hired and promoted, decisions are made, and the organization is structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This emphasis originated during the pandemic when a small team faced a large market opportunity, making execution speed paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Key outcomes of Ramp's velocity:
*   Built a competitor to MX in three months with about eight engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   Developed a competitor to Expensify six months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Expanded into accounts payable, building a competitor to Bill.com in three months with a team of three engineers, one designer, and one PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This product now processes billions of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

Velocity is viewed as a good metric for team performance, as high-velocity teams can achieve impact through continuous iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. It also helps attract top talent, as many join Ramp specifically because of its ability to build and ship quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Furthermore, high velocity helps de-risk decisions by lowering the cost of making them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## [[speed_vs_quality_in_product_development | Quality in High-Velocity Environments]]

Contrary to intuition, Ramp's experience aligns with research suggesting that quality can *increase* with product velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>. This is because rapid iteration allows for quick fixes and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:33">[02:21:33]</a>.

To ensure quality alongside velocity, Ramp [[operationalizing_quality_in_product_design | operationalizes quality]] through specific control mechanisms:
*   **Voice of Customer (VoC) Process:** Every negative customer review is shared monthly with the relevant tech lead, PM, and designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:51">[02:21:51]</a>.
*   **Performance Metrics:** NPS, CSAT, and operational overhead (percentage of support tickets originating from a product area normalized by user count) are regularly reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:16">[02:22:16]</a>.
*   **Direct Bug Assignment:** Bugs are directly assigned to the on-call engineer, ensuring they feel the impact and leverage velocity to resolve issues quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:37">[02:22:37]</a>. Ramp aims to fix every bug as it's surfaced, avoiding a bug backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:06">[02:23:06]</a>.
*   **User Confusion Metrics:** The number of support tickets due to customer confusion is tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:28">[02:23:28]</a>. If this number is elevated, teams are prevented from shipping new features until these issues are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:39">[02:23:39]</a>.

These controls ensure that high velocity does not compromise business stability, allowing teams autonomy as long as key quality metrics are maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:13">[02:30:13]</a>.

## Avoiding Burnout

The discussion around "working hard" and burnout often misses the point that impact and satisfaction from one's work are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:40">[02:59:40]</a>. Velocity, in fact, can help avoid burnout because it means effort is translating into tangible results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>. Burnout is more likely when effort yields no movement or impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:57">[02:59:57]</a>.

Ramp encourages teams to:
*   **Focus on what truly matters:** Building great products for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:48">[03:14:48]</a>.
*   **Enter a flow state:** Where work becomes thrilling and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:11">[03:22:11]</a>.
*   **Minimize distractions:** Organizations, especially as they grow, often create distractions (meetings, cross-functional requests) that hinder this flow state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:09">[03:36:09]</a>.
*   **Foster ownership:** When teams feel like it's "their goal" and "their mini-company," they are more likely to avoid burnout. Burnout occurs when work is pushed onto them, or they lack alignment and empowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:43">[03:19:43]</a>.

## Operationalizing Velocity and Quality

### Team Structure and Empowerment
Ramp's recipe for velocity involves:
*   Small teams with a single-threaded focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.
*   Providing necessary resources to execute lofty goals on tight timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.
*   Shielding teams from organizational chaos, even keeping new initiatives under wraps until product-market fit is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.

To achieve this, Ramp removes anything that distracts individual contributors from their single goal, including research, production engineering, or external processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. Leadership actively protects development teams from distractions. For example, a rotational program for production engineers handles escalations, bugs, and issues, while product operators shield PMs from documentation, release management, enablement, and customer requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>.

Ramp embraces "context over control," meaning leaders align teams on goals, hypotheses, data, and potential solutions, rather than being prescriptive about solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>. The best solutions often come from teams closer to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>. Leaders act as "repeaters in chief," constantly sharing context that teams might be missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>.

> "Whenever things went wrong at Ramp, it was when I was being prescriptive with regards to the solution without actually explaining and aligning Upstream on the goal, the hypothesis, and the data." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:37">[01:57:37]</a>

The contract between leadership and product teams is their strategy and roadmap. As long as this is aligned, the leader's role is to provide context and coaching, while the team's role is to highlight risks and one-way decisions that require leadership input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:11">[01:58:11]</a>.

### Minimal Planning
Ramp openly acknowledges that high velocity leads to some chaos: shipping things that don't work perfectly, changing products without full enablement, and constantly being on one's toes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:09">[03:33:09]</a>. However, this is seen as a necessary trade-off for innovation and providing continuous customer value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:41">[03:37:41]</a>.

Planning is kept lean:
*   **"Any second you spend planning is a second you don't spend doing."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:25">[03:25:25]</a>
*   Accuracy in planning is only increased for high-value activities, such as large market moments coordinating product, marketing, and sales (e.g., once a quarter or every six months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:59">[03:44:59]</a>. This is typically a small percentage of total R&D focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:58">[03:49:58]</a>.
*   Teams are largely autonomous and self-organizing within their pods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:02">[03:24:02]</a>.
*   Ramp moved from costly quarterly OKR planning (consuming 33% of time) to a bi-annual, one-page document outlining company priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:01">[04:06:01]</a>.
*   Product Managers avoid traditional OKRs, focusing instead on the product roadmap as the primary contract to sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:08">[04:16:08]</a>. Leadership is accountable if the roadmap doesn't meet company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:04">[04:19:04]</a>.

### First Principles Thinking
Ramp emphasizes thinking from first principles because its business combines elements of a credit card company, payments company, and software company, serving both SMBs (PLG) and enterprises (sales-driven) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:21">[04:41:21]</a>. This unique blend means traditional "pattern matching" from past experiences is often ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>.

Thinking from first principles involves:
*   Going back to the fundamental purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:55">[04:54:55]</a>.
*   Hiring people who can set aside past experiences and think deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:58">[04:59:58]</a>.
*   Challenging assumptions (e.g., rejecting "my past company XYZ" arguments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:58">[04:59:58]</a>.

An example is Ramp's support team reporting directly into the product organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:46">[05:01:46]</a>. This stems from the first principle that "every support ticket is a failure of our product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:58">[05:06:58]</a>. This structure holds the product team accountable for user experience and ensures deep customer understanding and feedback integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:37">[05:07:37]</a>. This approach led to an extremely low contact rate despite hundreds of thousands of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:15">[05:17:15]</a>.

### [[understanding_work_for_product_development | The Role of the Product Manager]]
With a lean PM team (1 PM to 8-15 engineers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:20">[05:22:20]</a>, Ramp distributes traditional PM tasks across other team members, ensuring everyone "thinks like a PM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:06">[05:27:06]</a>.

The core PM role at Ramp includes:
*   **Team Building:** Fostering culture within the product pod, organizing ideation sessions, and ensuring team cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:06">[05:31:06]</a>.
*   **Focus Alignment:** Ensuring the team is clear on its actual focus areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:04">[05:34:04]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Protection:** Shielding the core team from external opinions, requests, and meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:13">[05:36:13]</a>.
*   **Central Point of Contact:** Being the go-to person for questions and requests, and bringing in the right people at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:58">[05:38:58]</a>.
*   **Strategic Vision:** PMs lead on strategy, vision, and high-level specifications, but engineers are empowered to break down work and create their own tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:39">[05:50:39]</a>.

Ramp invests in Product Operations to handle operational functions like project management, issue management, release management, enablement, and customer research, further freeing up PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:01">[05:59:01]</a>.

### Hiring for Velocity
To build an A-plus team capable of high velocity, Ramp looks for:
*   **Strong desire for impact:** Assessed by past achievements or reasons for job changes (e.g., leaving due to slow pace or bureaucracy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:02">[06:06:02]</a>.
*   **Deep thinking ability:** Interviewers probe deeply into past decisions and trade-offs to understand how candidates think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:03">[06:44:03]</a>.
*   **Hunger:** A fundamental quality valued more than experience, given Ramp's unique business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:03">[06:44:03]</a>.
*   **A-plus engineers and designers:** These are seen as the biggest reason for Ramp's success, requiring significant early investment in hiring top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:39">[06:50:39]</a>.

Qualities of A-plus engineers and designers that enable Ramp's culture:
*   Desire to win in the market and for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:30">[06:12:30]</a>.
*   Understanding of the business context and curiosity about how the company operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:07">[06:26:07]</a>.
*   Ability to execute without constant help and proactively drive projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:08">[06:27:08]</a>.
*   Proactiveness in helping (e.g., jumping into Slack channels to answer questions, fix bugs, explain features) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:06">[06:31:06]</a>.
*   Accountability for their product's performance and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:03">[06:39:03]</a>.

> "There's drawbacks to that culture right where you get to like a radically empowered engineering team that thinks that they know the product better than the designer or the PM and they push back on the designs or they disagree with the PM but I'll take that culture any day compared to a culture where they're just you know taking things at face value and not challenging the thinking and not actually thinking from their own perspectives." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:09">[06:49:09]</a>

This proactive and challenging mindset, while sometimes harder to manage, drives deeper thinking and faster growth for the entire team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:39">[06:50:39]</a>.

### Tips for [[implementing_technical_and_cultural_practices_for_efficient_software_development | Efficient Software Development]]
*   **Eliminate meetings and status updates:** These are significant time-wasters. Statuses should be async and real-time within existing systems. Meetings should focus on collaboration, ideation, and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:07">[02:26:07]</a>.
*   **Be clear about trade-offs:** Leaders must present clear trade-offs to executives, explaining what is being done and what is *not* being done. This increases focus and velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>.
*   **Leadership encouragement:** Simple positive comments from leaders on project channels or at design critiques can be highly motivating for teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>.
*   **Prioritize deep work:** Block out time for thinking and problem-solving. Turn off notifications, check emails minimally, and use tools effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:02">[05:54:02]</a>.
*   **Robust task management:** At the end of every meeting, record tasks owed by oneself and others, including clear deadlines. Group tasks logically (tactical vs. strategic, important vs. less important) and use reminders to offload memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:02">[05:54:02]</a>.
*   **Visionary prototypes:** Designers spending more time on visionary prototypes and sharing them via video (e.g., Loom) provides clarity and excitement, unlocking velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:08">[06:12:08]</a>.

A growth model is an analytical representation of how a business grows, typically built in a spreadsheet. It serves as a powerful tool for understanding business mechanics, assessing opportunities, and informing strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. While not a forecasting tool, it's excellent for opportunity assessment and understanding the impact of different initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Components of a Growth Model

A growth model essentially acts as a formula for a business, bringing together key factors that drive its trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The core building blocks remain consistent across most business types, with nuances added for specific models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### For a SaaS Business
The simplest use case, a SaaS business, typically has three main components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>:
1.  **Acquisition Channels**: Understanding where traffic originates (paid marketing, sales, viral referrals) and associated assumptions like traffic, spend, and conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
2.  **Retention**: The rate at which customers activate and their monthly retention curve, indicating how long they remain customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
3.  **Monetization**: How revenue is generated, such as monthly or annual fees per customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

These elements, when multiplied, roughly determine the business's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### For a Transactional Business
For businesses based on transactions, additional layers are needed beyond the SaaS components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>:
*   **Transaction Frequency**: How many transactions occur per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Average Order Value (AOD)**: The typical value of each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Unit Economics**: Modeling costs like Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) that are often higher than in SaaS businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### For a Marketplace Business
Marketplaces introduce further complexity, requiring consideration of both demand and supply sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>:
*   **Supply Acquisition and Retention**: Modeling how suppliers are acquired and retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Interaction between Supply and Demand**: Understanding how adding supply impacts demand (e.g., does more supply create happier customers who retain longer?) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Non-Linear Relationships**: Incorporating factors like virality (existing customers referring new ones) or reinvestment of contribution margin into paid marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This highlights why [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | payback period]] is a better measure for paid marketing than LTV to CAC, as it reflects the speed of reinvestment for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Challenges and Advice for Building
One significant challenge is the sensitivity to assumptions, especially in marketplaces where many assumptions stack up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The interaction between supply and demand is particularly hard to model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

*   **Tread Lightly**: When dealing with core incentives or mechanisms in a marketplace, it's crucial to "tread lightly" as actions can have unpredictable, long-term consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>.
*   **Start Simple**: Begin with a very basic, high-level conceptual model to understand the entire system and identify important levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Mini-Models**: Each team or product pod should have its own "mini-model" describing their specific area of the business and the inputs that drive their North Star metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Stitching these into one master model is often too difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Collaboration**: The best way to start building is to partner with a smart analyst or finance person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. The process of building the model itself (the "painful" part) is where much of the learning occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Reforge**: For deep dives into building these models, resources like Reforge are highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Using a Growth Model for Strategy

Once a growth model is established, it becomes a crucial input for strategic planning, especially for [[building_and_managing_growth_teams | resource allocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

*   **Common Currency**: It helps create a common currency to compare the impact of different teams' efforts on various metrics, allowing for better allocation decisions across the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
*   **Identifying Levers**: It clarifies which levers an individual product team should pull to achieve their North Star goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Such models should be a core part of any product group's strategy document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

## Key Learnings from Growth Models

### The Power of Retention
A significant insight from building growth models is that business growth is often far more sensitive to [[importance_of_retention_in_growth_models | customer retention]] than initially intuited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Even small percentage gains in retention can be much more valuable than larger changes in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

*   **Product Experience**: Retention is the culmination of the entire product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Improving it rarely comes from direct "growth hacks" like sending more emails, but rather from understanding and improving the core customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. In marketplaces, this often relates to the depth of supply or interactions with supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
*   **Early User Experience**: The biggest wins in retention usually come from improving the early user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Focusing on the first week or month provides a significant opportunity to prove the product's value and reduce variability in initial experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
*   **Avoid Resurrection**: While tempting to re-engage churned users, it's generally much harder and less leveraged than focusing on new users, as churned users have already decided against the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.
*   **Correlation vs. Causation**: Beware of the analytical failure mode where "best users do X, so we should make other users do X." Correlational exercises rarely work because there's something unique about those users or their initial experience driving their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

## Marketplace Growth Metrics

Marketplaces are unique businesses, hard to start but powerful once established due to compounding defensibility and often improving economics (CAC goes down, LTV goes up) as they scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

Key metrics to evaluate the health of a marketplace:

1.  **GMV or Transactions**: A fundamental measure that combines both supply and demand activity, serving as the ultimate North Star metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
2.  **Unit Economics**: Crucial for understanding profitability, as early-stage marketplaces often have poor or negative unit economics (e.g., Instacart losing money per order) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
3.  **Liquidity**: Defined as the reliability of the marketplace â€“ how often consumers find what they're looking for or suppliers make a sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. This should be expressed in terms of a product experience metric the customer cares about, like wait time for Uber/Lyft or conversion rate for e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. Until a marketplace is liquid, little else matters, which is why focusing on a specific geography or category first is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
4.  **Share of Wallet**: For buyers, this is the percentage of their total spend captured by the marketplace versus alternatives; for sellers, it's the percentage of their business done through the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. Higher share of wallet leads to higher LTVs and reduces multi-tenancy (using other marketplaces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. It's a measure of depth over breadth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a> and is often more important on the supply side, especially in B2B marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

## Marketplace Growth Strategies

### Prioritizing Supply vs. Demand
While both are crucial, people often "over-rotate" on supply and "under-focus" on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. Supply is critical early on because it *is* the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. However, ultimately, demand is the only thing that matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. A winning marketplace aggregates demand because suppliers will always join if given customers at a profitable rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.

The nuance is that acquiring hard-to-get supply is often how you aggregate demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>. Therefore, supply acquisition should be framed by its impact on demand and the customer benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. Instead of focusing on strict marketplace balance metrics, it's better to build dual-sided [[frameworks_for_growth_in_product_management | ROI equations]] that fully internalize the marketplace dynamic (e.g., CAC of acquiring a rider plus the CAC of drivers needed for that rider) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

### Expanding Marketplaces
When expanding, focus less on the total addressable market (TAM) of adjacent opportunities and more on how easily the existing model can expand into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.

*   **Adjacency**: How similar is the new market to the current business model? (e.g., Instacart expanding to convenience stores over traditional retail) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.
*   **Network Effects**: Can expanding into a new market accentuate existing network effects by using the same supplier base or addressing multiple demands from the same consumer? (e.g., Uber Eats leveraging Uber drivers and ride customers wanting meals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.
*   **Product First**: Don't let go-to-market efforts get too far ahead of product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. Delivering an incredible end-to-end customer experience, even for a small number of customers, creates the "flame" that drives organic retention and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. This reinforces the advice to focus on getting a flywheel going, not just GMV or growth rates, early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

### SaaS + Marketplace Integration
It's generally easier for a marketplace to add a SaaS component than for a SaaS business to add a marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>. Marketplaces inherently focus on generating demand (a high-value activity) and have established relationships on both sides, which SaaS businesses lack for the demand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.

*   **Customer Pain**: For a marketplace adding SaaS, the focus should be on solving customer pain points and creating a better, stickier experience, rather than just seeking additional margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.
*   **Core First**: Ensure the core marketplace is highly liquid and high-performing before considering expansion levers like adding SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

### Vertical vs. Horizontal Marketplaces
The idea of "unbundling" (e.g., breaking off a niche from a broad platform like eBay or LinkedIn) is often overhyped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.

*   **Scale Benefits**: Unbundling theses often over-focus on user experience improvements while under-focusing on the economic benefits of scale, such as higher customer LTV and stronger network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Conditions for Vertical Success**: A vertical unbundling is more likely to succeed if the sub-segment is:
    1.  **Very high frequency or very high dollar value**: leading to high customer LTV (e.g., Airbnb unbundling from Craigslist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.
    2.  **Self-contained network**: Where the network effect doesn't significantly benefit from the broader platform (e.g., a LinkedIn for blue-collar workers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

### B2B Marketplaces
The relative scarcity of B2B marketplaces compared to consumer ones is partly due to fewer founders understanding niche B2B problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. However, the bigger reason is **fragmentation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.

*   **Fragmentation**: This measures how many businesses exist in a space relative to transaction volume. A highly fragmented market means many small players, while a concentrated market means a few large players control most of the volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.
*   **Why Fragmentation Matters**: In a concentrated market, large players have less need for a marketplace (they have their own sales teams, operations) and are less willing to pay high commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. They also face more problems with disintermediation, where suppliers and customers bypass the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>.
*   **Transaction Value**: If the total dollars per transaction are very high (e.g., tens of thousands), it becomes more attractive for parties to bypass the marketplace and save on commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.

## The Future of Marketplaces
Newer marketplaces are charging higher commissions because they are doing more work to justify those commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>. This evolution can be seen in stages:

1.  **Marketplace 1.0 (Lead Gen)**: Primarily aggregates demand, lower commissions (e.g., Zillow, HomeAdvisor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.
2.  **Managed Marketplace (Trust)**: Adds fundamental value by generating trust and vetting supply (e.g., Airbnb, Etsy), allowing for higher commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>.
3.  **Heavily Managed/Value Chain Integration**: Marketplaces take over distinct parts of the value chain (e.g., DoorDash owning logistics, Fair underwriting transactions), playing a more fundamental role and thus charging higher commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

Ultimately, this continuum can lead to an "Event Horizon" where a marketplace might evolve *out* of the marketplace model entirely and become an e-commerce business, charging 100% commission (e.g., OpenDoor, which owns homes rather than facilitating peer-to-peer transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

The key variable determining whether a marketplace will consolidate or remain in "marketplace mode" is **how much creativity is needed in the space** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>:
*   If customers primarily value standardization and consistency (e.g., ride-sharing), the industry will likely consolidate away from a marketplace model (e.g., with autonomous vehicles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.
*   If customers value suppliers bringing amazing, creative new things (e.g., Etsy, Amazon, Steam), then marketplaces will continue to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>.

Anuka Gupta, Chief Product Officer at Rubrik and a lecturer on product management at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, shares her insights on "founder mode" — a concept recently popularized by Paul Graham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. She notes that Graham's articulation of founder mode has opened up valuable discussions for both founders and those who work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Working with a Founder in Founder Mode

As a product leader working with a founder operating in founder mode, Anuka suggests leveraging their unique position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Understanding the Founder's Role
When a founder is effectively in founder mode, they are deeply understanding the business and strategically using their power to either tweak existing elements or fundamentally innovate and change directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Leveraging Their Power
A key approach for a product leader is to recognize the founder's power and utilize it to advance initiatives beneficial to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This means engaging the CEO as an ally to push significant changes that a product leader alone might struggle to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Founders possess substantial power to drive change that others within the organization may not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Navigating Disagreements
When a founder proposes an idea that a product leader may not fully agree with, it's crucial to:
1.  **Step back and understand their objective**: Objectively analyze why the founder is pushing a particular idea, what ultimate goal they are trying to achieve, and if the proposed mechanism is the right way to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
2.  **Propose alternatives**: If the proposed method isn't optimal, engage in a conversation where you acknowledge their objective but suggest exploring other options to tackle the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
3.  **Choose your battles**: As a product leader, you must decide which issues are critical enough to "die on that hill" and which can be conceded for the greater good of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Being a Product Leader in Founder Mode

Anuka herself is recognized for excelling in founder mode as a product leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Her approach involves:

### Deep Business Understanding
It's tempting for leaders to avoid getting into the intricate details of the business to empower their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. However, Anuka stresses the importance of deeply understanding what's working, what's not, and the financial goals of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This deep understanding allows leaders to choose when to intervene and make significant or minor course corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

### Bringing the Team Along
When operating in founder mode, it's essential to involve the team without making them feel that their work is being overridden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Tactics include:
*   **Early engagement**: Ask team members to present their strategies early on, allowing you to ask questions and make suggestions without rewriting the entire plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
*   **Focus on strategic areas**: Prioritize areas most critical for the business's survival, biggest opportunities, or those that will "kill the business if we don't get right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. This provides clarity and rallies the team around key objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **Leading with hypotheses and questions**: Instead of directly stating flaws, share a hypothesis or an observation (e.g., from customer feedback) and invite discussion. This fosters dialogue and allows the team to arrive at conclusions collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. This approach makes people feel heard, especially with diverse viewpoints, and helps move past conflict to the core issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

### Tactical Approaches
Two specific tactics can help product leaders operate more effectively in founder mode and appear more strategic:

#### The "One Click Better" Approach
This concept aligns with the idea of "betterment" in strategy, where instead of pursuing a huge, lofty vision, you identify the biggest constraint or bottleneck in the business and simply make it "one click better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. This incremental improvement, when applied consistently, leads to significant progress over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Similarly, focusing on the "adjacent possible"—the next achievable step—is more effective than aiming for a massive, distant goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

#### Summarization
A powerful tactic for product leaders, especially in meetings, is **summarization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. By synthesizing different voices and opinions, you provide clarity on the emerging direction, acting as a checkpoint for agreement or further discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This act of summarization is often perceived as strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. It helps elevate your strategic thinking and prompts the pursuit of larger ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

**How to summarize effectively:**
*   **Verbal interjection**: "Hey, let me pause here for a second and try to capture what has been said" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Frame as a question**: End your summary with a question to invite further discussion and ensure alignment (e.g., "Is everyone in agreement with that, or is there some dissent?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
*   **Visual aids**: Use a whiteboard to summarize discussions in real-time, especially if interrupting is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
*   **Chat**: In virtual meetings, use the chat function to summarize, offering a "lower stakes" way to contribute without interrupting the flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

## Connecting Founder Mode to Being Strategic

Anuka received feedback early in her career that she "wasn't strategic enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Her research and experience led her to define being strategic with two core components:

1.  **Articulating a Compelling "Why"**: The ability to develop and clearly communicate the simple, compelling reason behind the company's and product's direction and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
2.  **Being a Change Agent**: Championing and executing difficult changes that are in the long-term best interest of the product or company, even if they are not easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

<mark>&#96;> [!NOTE] Strategic Leadership]
You won't be seen as strategic if you excel at one component without the other. Articulating a strong "why" for small ideas is not strategic, nor is championing big ideas without a clear, compelling "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.</mark>

### Application in Strategic Planning
In strategic planning, especially in fast-moving sectors like cybersecurity, the process involves summarizing diverse voices and ideas to identify pathways forward. This process of synthesizing information and making it "one click better" leads to pursuing big ideas that can become significant change agents for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. This approach has led to a material difference in the number and quality of big ideas pursued at Rubrik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

## Importance of Mindset

Ultimately, the mindset brought to work is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>. Approaching every situation with a positive, abundant mindset allows for greater achievement than one might expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. To cultivate this, Anuka recommends **journaling** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. Writing down negative thoughts and exploring their origins helps deconstruct abstract ruminations, making it possible to identify irrational thoughts and understand what's within one's control to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. This practice, akin to cognitive behavioral therapy, helps process and diminish the power of difficult emotions, creating space for positive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.

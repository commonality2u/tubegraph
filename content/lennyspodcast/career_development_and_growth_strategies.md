This article outlines key [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth strategies]] and advice from Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon, executive coach, and course creator, who specializes in helping leaders develop into executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Evans spent 15 years at Amazon, contributing to projects like Prime Video, the Amazon Appstore, Prime Gaming, and Twitch Commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. He also helped draft one of Amazon's 14 core leadership principles and holds over 70 patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## The Magic Loop for Career Advancement

The "Magic Loop" is a five-step framework designed by Ethan Evans to help individuals grow their careers in almost any circumstance, even with a difficult manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. It is currently one of the most popular posts on Lenny's newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

The goal of the Magic Loop is to help individuals achieve [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | career satisfaction]], move up, earn more, or change their focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. It works by fostering a partnership with leadership, where both parties help each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Five Steps of the Magic Loop
1.  **Do your current job well**: Ensure you are performing at a solid level so your manager isn't wishing you were different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
2.  **Ask your boss how you can help**: This simple question sets you apart and builds a team-oriented relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
3.  **Do what they ask**: Fulfill the request, even if it's not your preferred work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
4.  **Connect their needs with your goals**: Ask your manager if there's a way you can help them that also helps you reach your personal career goals (e.g., changing roles, getting a raise, learning a new skill) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
5.  **Repeat**: Continuously loop through these steps, building trust and a mutually beneficial relationship with your manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Why it Works
*   **Managers rarely get offered help**: Management can be a lonely job, and having an ally is a huge relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **Human Nature**: It leverages the natural human tendency to help those who help us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Breaks Oppositional Relationships**: It shifts the dynamic from a "boss vs. employee" mentality to a partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   **Clarifies Gaps and Goals**: The process implicitly helps identify what is needed for advancement and explicitly encourages sharing your personal career goals with your manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Managers often make assumptions about employees' aspirations, so clear communication is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

### Applicability
The Magic Loop is designed for individuals who either don't know what to do next in their [[career_advice_and_frameworks | career]] or have a busy or less-than-ideal manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. It assumes people want to grow in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE]
An entry-level person applied the Magic Loop, received a $30,000 raise and a bigger job offer, turned it down for an even better offer at another company, and was subsequently promoted there as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Another individual, starting as a mid-level engineer at Amazon, followed this process to become a senior engineer, then a manager, a senior manager, director, and eventually an Executive Vice President at a major online bank over eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

The Magic Loop is effective from the start of a career up to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. At the executive level (e.g., VP), the explicit conversations become less necessary as managers expect you to anticipate needs and be proactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This "advanced mode" involves suggesting solutions and keeping your leader informed, rather than always asking how to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## Getting Unstuck at Senior Manager Level

Many individuals get stuck at the Senior Manager level (e.g., L7, M1, M2) due to limited director positions and the changing economic landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. The difference between a senior manager and a director is often a shift from functional expertise and execution to influence, coordination, and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.

[!TIP]
Patience is required, but individuals can proactively practice [[hiring_and_developing_growth_leaders | next-level skills]] and work with their leadership on strategic projects to show they are ready for a higher role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. This means "doing the job before you have the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. Leaders want to promote strong, capable direct reports because it helps their own job and team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

## Cultivating Inventiveness

Jeff Bezos views himself primarily as an inventor, and Amazon aims to be an "Invention Machine" that systematically out-invents others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

[!TIP]
To become systematically inventive:
1.  **Be an expert**: Have deep knowledge in the area you wish to invent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
2.  **Dedicate time to thinking**: Set aside dedicated, device-free time to concentrate on problems and how existing concepts can be combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. Even two hours once a month can be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
3.  **Combine existing concepts**: True invention often comes from putting two existing things together in a new way, rather than creating something entirely new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE]
Evans developed a patent for drone delivery where a truck acts as a mobile "aircraft carrier" for drones, allowing them to service a neighborhood more efficiently than a single driver stopping at each house. This idea came from combining thoughts about drones and military aircraft carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

A single good idea can take years to fully express and optimize, as seen with Amazon Prime or the Kindle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. Much of Jeff Bezos's innovation comes from optimizing existing ideas to make them cheaper, better, and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

## Standing Out in Interviews

Based on interviewing over 2,200 people, Evans highlights key factors for standing out in job interviews:

1.  **Appearance and Enthusiasm**: While not about beauty, looking interested and being enthusiastic is crucial. People want to work with those who want to work with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.
2.  **Focus on Impact, not just "Done"**: Candidates, especially at higher levels, should discuss *why* their work mattered and the *impact* it had on the company or customers, rather than just listing tasks performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.

For online interviews (Zoom):
*   **Show full-time dedication**: Avoid taking interviews from a car, keep your camera on, and maintain eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.
*   **Project enthusiasm**: Use body language and gestures to convey excitement and appreciation for the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
*   **Be engaged and energetic**: A good night's sleep and coffee can be better prep than over-obsessing about content, as how you come across is very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.

## Lessons from Failure: The Jeff Bezos Story

Ethan Evans shares a pivotal moment when he failed on a major project launch for Jeff Bezosâ€”the Amazon Appstore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. On launch day, a critical "Test Drive" feature emphasized by Bezos was not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. Bezos's direct emails escalated quickly, involving Evans's management chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

[!TIP]
Key takeaways for managing failure, especially with high-stakes leaders:
1.  **Own the problem**: Immediately admit fault and take responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
2.  **Proactive and consistent communication**: Provide regular updates (e.g., hourly) on the status, what's being done, and when the next update will be. This rebuilds trust and prevents micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.
3.  **Work hard and fast to fix it**: Pull out all stops to recover from the mistake, even if it's uncomfortable or requires working long hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
4.  **Face leadership in person (if possible)**: It's harder for leaders to be angry or "flame" someone face-to-face, which can help de-escalate the situation and rebuild rapport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Evans specifically sat next to Jeff Bezos in a subsequent meeting, which led to a human conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.
5.  **Don't quit due to shame**: Many people might quit after such a public failure, but it's possible to recover. Leaders often value those who can learn and persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. Evans was promoted to VP two years after this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.

[!WARNING]
Evans admits to making a mistake by prioritizing a launch date over perfect certainty, which led to the public failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. He learned to "Fear The New York Times headline" and now advocates for extensive beta testing to prevent public failures, even if it means risking leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

He also deeply regretted not reaching out to the junior engineer whose code caused the bug, as the engineer likely felt undue responsibility and eventually left the company. This highlights the importance of supporting team members through mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.

## Amazon Leadership Principles

Evans helped craft the language for Amazon's "Ownership" leadership principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>. The core phrase he proposed was: "An owner never says that's not my job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This principle was added after Amazon's leadership principles were merged into a single list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. It's considered the most impactful thing he's ever written, influencing 1.5 million Amazon employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

Another key principle Evans values is "Bias for Action," which emphasizes that speed matters in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. Many decisions are reversible, making quick action necessary to outcompete others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. This principle must be balanced, as Evans's own failure with Jeff Bezos stemmed from an unbalanced bias for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.

The principle "Leaders are Right a Lot" has been revised to emphasize actively working to disconfirm one's beliefs and seeking diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. This encourages constant questioning and awareness of potential biases in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.

## Contrarian Opinions

*   **Return to Office Movement**: Evans is contrarian on the strong push for a full return to office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>. Offices have been evolving for 300 years and have limited room for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>. Remote work, having only been prevalent for a few years, has significant unexplored opportunities for improvement that will likely outweigh the known benefits of office work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.
*   **Doing Business on a Handshake**: He believes too much of the world is contract-driven, leading to a loss of trust. He prefers operating on faith and mutual commitment, even if it means occasionally getting "burned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. This philosophy aligns with Sam Altman's approach of trusting people on balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

## Recommended Books
*   **Decisive** by Chip and Dan Heath: Focuses on the science of making better decisions in both professional and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Self-Deception** by The Arbinger Institute: Explores how individuals often cause their interpersonal problems while blaming others, and how to identify one's role in the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>.
*   **The Almanac of Naval Ravikant**: Offers a recipe for success while loving what you do, emphasizing finding what you uniquely do best as your defensible [[career_advice_and_frameworks | career]] value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

## Interview Question
Ethan Evans's favorite interview question for leaders is: "Tell me about a time where you needed to disagree with your management, where you needed to stand up or fight for a position against higher leadership or people in power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. This assesses a candidate's ability to have backbone, disagree, and commit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28">[01:15:28]</a>.

## Personal Motto
"To whom much has been given, from him much will be required." This motto guides his thinking on social responsibility and paying it forward, especially given his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:34">[01:16:34]</a>.

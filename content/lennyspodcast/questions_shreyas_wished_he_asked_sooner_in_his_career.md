## Questions Shreyas Wished He Asked Sooner in His Career

During a live recording of Lenny's podcast at the Lean Fwd Summit in San Francisco, Shreyas Doshi shared three key questions, plus a bonus, that he wished he had asked himself earlier in his career as a product leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His career as a PM leader was described as being "full of suffering," though he has "zero complaints about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. He realized that even when he did ask himself questions, he wasn't always honest with his answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### 1. Why am I so busy? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>

Shreyas spent most of his 20-year product career feeling "completely stressed out" due to constant busyness and a feeling of not being able to accomplish everything he wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This led to dissatisfaction and even physical health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. While traditional productivity tips like maintaining a to-do list or using frameworks like LNO are helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, they eventually fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

He identifies an "immovable force" that overwhelms product leaders: growing scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. As one's career advances, scope expands to a point where no amount of efficiency or prioritization can prevent busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

#### The Problem with Annual Planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>
Annual planning often involves weeks of filling spreadsheets, meetings, and managing dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. However, this elaborate planning often becomes irrelevant quickly, as unforeseen customer escalations or other demands necessitate revisions, leading to the original plan being forgotten by late February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The common adage "Plans are useless but planning is everything" is often invoked but misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

#### Solution: A Real Product Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>
Shreyas discovered that with a *real*, aligned [[building_a_longterm_career_strategy | product strategy]], planning for a major product at Stripe took him only three days, compared to four to six weeks for his peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This strategy, with pre-alignment from all stakeholders, reduces unnecessary planning rituals and the need for false precision in resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

*   **Tactical Tip**: A clear [[building_a_longterm_career_strategy | product strategy]] can resolve many prioritization and planning problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

#### The Cost of Bad Product Decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>
Another reason for busyness is making poor product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Shreyas notes that many product teams make decisions without thoroughly considering customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Often, decisions are based on engineering availability rather than product merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

The "two-way door" fallacy, popularized by Jeff Bezos, suggests quick decisions can be easily reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. However, for most PM leaders, these doors are actually "one-way doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Committing to a feature that isn't well-conceived leads to:
*   Spending weeks on development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.
*   Lack of adoption, requiring the use of "favorable anecdotes" instead of data in QBRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   Calls for more "bells and whistles" to meet "table stakes," leading to even more unplanned work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   Accumulating "debt" from features that should never have been built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

*   **Tactical Tip**: Pause for two minutes, two days, or two weeks before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. "Thinking is cheap, so you should do more thinking, not less" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

### 2. Do I actually have good taste? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>

Shreyas reflected on his early career at Google, where the mantra was "we don't do strategy here, strategy is for MBAs... we are all about execution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. He adopted this belief until joining Twitter post-IPO, where he realized that despite incredible assets and talent, the company struggled due to a lack of a "real compelling cohesive [[building_a_longterm_career_strategy | product strategy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. This solidified his realization that his earlier belief about strategy was wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

#### Beyond Pixels: Taste in Beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>
While "taste" is often associated with design and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>, Shreyas emphasizes a deeper form of taste: "Do we have good taste around the beliefs we choose to create within ourselves as product leaders?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a> These beliefs dictate how leaders manage, lead, and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

True taste is "the ability to identify what is really good without needing to see its results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. It requires no taste to recognize success after the fact (e.g., Nvidia's CEO in 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>; real taste identifies potential *before* it's evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

Shreyas observed that people are often impressed by:
*   **Cool metaphors** (e.g., "two-way door" vs. "reversible/irreversible decisions") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   **Authority bias** (e.g., "Because Bezos said it") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   **Alliterations** (e.g., "fail fast" vs. "fail quickly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **Complicated charts and math** that aren't fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

*   **Tactical Tip**: To become a more critical thinker and develop better taste, leaders must shed patterns influenced by social proof and authority, and evaluate ideas independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.

### 3. Why does my job feel so frustrating? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>

Despite loving his PM leadership role, Shreyas experienced daily frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. He attributes this to the inherent loneliness of the PM leader's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a> and, more profoundly, to operating in "misalignment with our superpowers and who we truly are at our core" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

#### The Three Levels of Product Work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>
Product work occurs at three levels:
1.  **Impact Level**: Focusing on strategic outcomes and long-term vision.
2.  **Execution Level**: Managing the day-to-day building and delivery.
3.  **Optics Level**: Managing perceptions, reporting, and external communication.

Shreyas found his "happy place" to be the impact level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. However, as one climbs the corporate ladder, a significant amount of time is often spent at the "Optics level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. This constant expenditure of willpower on tasks outside one's preferred operating level leads to frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

#### Solution: Abandoning the Traditional Path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>
Shreyas realized he had to abandon the traditional corporate progression driven by external expectations ("what will people say on LinkedIn?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. Instead, he chose to return to managing an earlier-stage product at Stripe, a team size (around 50 people including engineers) that allowed him to operate more at his preferred impact level, rather than being forced into extensive optics work inherent in managing larger organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

*   **Tactical Tip**: Identify your "superpowers" and operate your career in accordance with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. Be true to yourself and make career decisions based on alignment, not external expectations or "LinkedIn envy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. This approach leads to better work, enjoyment, and reduces frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

### Bonus Question: Am I really listening? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>

Shreyas found this to be the hardest question for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. He initially believed he was a good listener, capable of recapping, making eye contact, and validating what he heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. However, he discovered "an entirely other level to listening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>, which, once understood, enables a leader to be world-class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.

*   **Resources**: For deeper insights into this level of listening, Shreyas recommends exploring what Rick Rubin, Dee Hock, and Peter Drucker have said on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>.

Deel is a payroll, HR, and compliance platform designed for global teams, helping companies expand internationally with tools for HR, immigration, employer of record, independent contractor hiring, and global and U.S. payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Deel has experienced remarkable growth, going from less than a million dollars in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in July 2020 to:
*   \$4 million ARR by January 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>
*   \$57 million by the end of 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
*   \$100 million by April 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
*   \$295 million by the start of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>

The company also prides itself on remaining EBITDA positive throughout this rapid [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Melton Quran Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, was the second marketing hire and employee number 19 or 20 overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Foundational Growth Principles

In the early days, Deel prioritized building a solid foundation before investing in more advanced [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This involved a step-by-step approach:
1.  **Website Presence**: Ensure a fast, existing website that search engines recognize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
2.  **Discoverability**: Focus on making the website findable through content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
3.  **Performance**: Paid advertising should only be considered after the website provides a good user experience, as a slow site (e.g., loading in over four seconds) will hinder the effectiveness of paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
4.  **Clear Messaging**: The company's one-liner or pitch should be unique to the business and clearly explain what it does, avoiding generic statements that could apply to many other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. Deel also worked on rapidly A/B testing different value propositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

## Early Growth Strategies (Low-Cost Channels)

Deel initially focused on "cheaper [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth channels]]" to kickstart [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:1:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The core idea is to add value by answering people's questions where they are actively looking for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. These channels are effective because people want problems solved, not to be sold to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Community Engagement
Deel leveraged communities by:
*   **Monitoring Keywords**: Setting up alerts for relevant keywords on platforms like Reddit and Quora to identify where people were asking questions about HR or international hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Providing Value**: Company team members would then go into these communities and genuinely answer questions, providing helpful information before mentioning Deel as a solution if it was a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Peer Answers**: Reddit, in particular, was seen as a key place for specific, semi-anonymous questions and peer answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Identifying Audience Size**: While individual community efforts might seem small, they add up over time, combined with word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. It's important to recognize the upper limit of the audience size in a specific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Closed Communities**: Deel also engaged with closed communities like Slack groups, Discord servers, or programs like Y Combinator, which offer access to specific groups of founders or business leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### SEO and Content Marketing
Content and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) have been crucial, initially contributing 80-90% of Deel's [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Now, non-paid channels like SEO and partnerships contribute roughly 50% of [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
Key SEO strategies include:
*   **Search Intent**: The primary goal is to ensure that when someone reads Deel's content, their "Google search is over" because their question has been fully answered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This means content must be valuable and comprehensive, not just keyword-stuffed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   **"Traffic Light System"**: Deel uses a framework to prioritize content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>:
    *   Identify up to 700 keywords related to Deel's services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
    *   Rank keywords by highest to lowest search volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
    *   Assess the user's intent for each keyword:
        *   **Green Light**: High intent, person wants Deel's solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
        *   **Yellow Light**: Medium intent, 50/50 chance they're looking to buy soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
        *   **Red Light**: Low intent, not looking to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
    *   Prioritize writing articles for green-light keywords first, then yellows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Understanding Search Engine Behavior**: It's crucial to understand what Google or other search engines are *already* servicing for a given query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. For example, "EOR" might bring up "Enhanced Oil Recovery" more often than "Employer of Record" if that's what most people search for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
*   **Utilizing "People Also Ask"**: The "People also ask" section at the bottom of Google search results helps identify follow-up questions users might have, guiding content creation to address those <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
*   **Readability & Tools**: Content should be written in simple, accessible language (e.g., 4th-grade reading level) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Tools like Clearscope are used to ensure proper keyword placement and assess content quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.
*   **Operational Focus**: Deel's content team is highly operational, with clear frameworks for deciding what gets published and ensuring fact-checking and timely updates, especially for regulations that change frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. They publish about five new articles and update five existing articles per week across multiple languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
*   **Discipline**: SEO is time-consuming and requires discipline; cutting corners leads to poor quality content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
*   **Suitability for SEO**: SEO is best suited for businesses solving active problems where people are *looking for solutions*, particularly in B2B. Consumer goods (like lipstick) are less suited for SEO, as people often find those products through social media or influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

### Partnerships
Strategic partnerships are key to [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. It's vital to partner not just with companies that have a shared audience, but with those who are seen as **trusted resources** for the specific problem Deel solves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>. For example, Venture Capital partners are highly effective because companies often ask their VCs for platform recommendations when expanding their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

## Evolving Growth Investments (Paid Channels)

Once the foundational elements and low-cost channels were established, Deel expanded into paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.
*   **Long-Tail Platforms**: Beyond the big four or five ad platforms, Deel invests in "long tail" places like review sites, smaller media outlets, newsletter ads, and podcast ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. Individually, these don't contribute much, but collectively they can make up about 30% of overall lead flow, diversifying the lead sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.
*   **Creative Fatigue**: The paid team constantly updates ad creatives (monthly, with exceptions for straightforward Google ads) to combat creative fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. Messaging also evolves with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Full-Funnel Measurement**: Marketers at Deel don't just track leads; they track the full customer journey, from lead to qualified opportunity to closed-won, and the average revenue generated from a customer one year out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. This data-driven approach determines the maximum affordable cost to acquire a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.
*   **Awareness Campaigns**: Deel generally avoids early awareness campaigns for B2B, as they are time-consuming, expensive, and often don't resonate until the company has refined its messaging and tapped into the "bottom of the funnel" of ready-to-convert customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

## Importance of Product Quality

A great product is at the core of Deel's [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. Acquisition channels are ineffective if the product doesn't meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. Deel's product was "top-notch" from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. In the B2B world, customers won't tolerate "crappy products" and will leave, spreading negative word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>. A sign of a strong product-focused company is a high ratio of product and engineers to sales staff in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

## Impact of External Factors (COVID-19)

While Deel launched before the pandemic, COVID-19 significantly accelerated its [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth]] by forcing companies into a "pilot program" of global remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. This made businesses comfortable hiring talent regardless of location, aligning with Deel's vision as a "global work platform," not just a remote work platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. The primary driver of adoption during this period was problem-solving and word-of-mouth, as companies urgently needed solutions for international payroll and independent contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.

## Building a Growth Team and Culture

### Team Hiring and Skills
*   **Revenue Commitment**: Early hires for the [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth]] team were expected to commit to closed-won revenue KPIs, not just lead numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. Candidates' past commitments and willingness to operate with limited resources are assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>.
*   **"Little Hands"**: Deel emphasizes a culture of "little hands," meaning everyone, regardless of seniority, must be willing to do the "nitty-gritty" work and not shy away from small tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.
*   **Early Hires**: The first hires for the [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | growth]] team included:
    1.  **Product Marketing**: To bridge the product and go-to-market teams and define messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>.
    2.  **Copywriter**: To support messaging and creative efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.
    3.  **Data Analyst**: To ensure every dollar spent was tracked and understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

### Team Structure
Deel uses a hybrid structure of regional and functional teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.
*   **Functional Teams**: These consist of subject matter experts (e.g., product marketing, content, community, paid ads, brand) who operate globally, as their skills are not location-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. This centralized approach fosters continuous learning and skill leveling within expert groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **Regional Teams**: Marketing managers for different key regions ensure local expertise and work with functional teams to execute strategies tailored to specific markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. Decisions on where to invest resources (e.g., running paid ads in Turkey) depend on total addressable market, opportunities, and competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.

### Culture
Deel's culture is characterized by:
*   **"Deel Speed"**: A core value emphasizing urgency and rapid action on behalf of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. This includes building products quickly and providing fast answers to customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.
*   **Default Optimism**: Maintaining a positive outlook, focusing on how things *can* work rather than why they won't, especially in a new and evolving space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>.
*   **Customer-Centricity**: Deep care for customers, recognizing that Deel deals with highly personal aspects of their lives, such as livelihoods, payroll, and legal compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: In return, Deel offers team members flexibility in choosing where and when they work, empowering them to set up their lives as they choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.
*   **Authenticity**: Being a remote-first company from day one fostered a culture of authenticity, as team members often interact from their homes, leading to a more personal connection and camaraderie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>.
*   **Evolving Values**: Deel's values were formalized about a year into the company's existence, recognizing existing cultural traits like "Deel Speed" that were already in common use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.

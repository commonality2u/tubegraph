Melissa Perri highlights that scaling [[getting_into_and_growing_in_product_management | product management]] is inherently challenging, which is where the emerging role of Product Operations (ProdOps) becomes crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. ProdOps aims to provide the right insights to teams and standardize outputs and check-ins to ensure alignment with strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.

## Why Product Operations?

When [[getting_into_and_growing_in_product_management | product management]] organizations scale rapidly, several issues can arise without a dedicated ProdOps function:
*   **Lack of Standardization** Product roadmaps may lack consistency in format, making it difficult to compare and roll them up into an overarching strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.
*   **Absence of Career Growth Paths** There may be no clear career ladders for [[getting_into_and_growing_in_product_management | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
*   **Inefficient Meetings** Organizations might have numerous meetings with the wrong attendees, leading to inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Data Access Challenges** [[getting_into_and_growing_in_product_management | Product managers]] may struggle to access the data needed for informed decisions on product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>, which is a common issue with leaders due to a lack of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>.
*   **Customer Research Inefficiencies** Customer interviews might be conducted in an uncoordinated manner, leading to the same customers being bothered repeatedly by different teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.

These challenges highlight that simply training people isn't enough; the underlying issues often stem from how goals are set and strategies are deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Without proper context and organizational structure, trained individuals lack direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Components of Product Operations

Perri identifies three typical components of a Product Operations function, though not all companies will implement all three or start with the same focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>:

### 1. Internal Data and Insights
This team focuses on taking all internal data—from financial systems, user analytics, and other company data sources—and surfacing it in ways that allow people to track strategic progress and OKRs. This provides necessary inputs for strategy, helps monitor its execution, and aids in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. To improve strategy, leaders need to start with data from everywhere and should consider hiring a data analyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

### 2. Customer Research and User Insights
This component deals with external data and market research, including customer insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.
*   **Market Research**: This involves subscribing to publications and consulting subject matter experts to understand market movements and innovation trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>.
*   **Customer Research**: This standardizes the approach to customer interactions. Its goal is not to centralize user research but to scale it, enabling more people to conduct research efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. This includes recording user interviews in a searchable format for later reference and preventing multiple teams from contacting the same customers repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

### 3. Standardizing Processes and Cadences
This part focuses on establishing consistent processes and meeting cadences for strategic check-ins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Roadmap Check-ins**: Defining who needs to be present and the frequency of these meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Planning Sessions**: Specifying inputs, outputs, decisions made, and what is reviewed in these executive meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.
*   **Cross-Divisional Processes**: Standardizing [[operating_models_and_collaboration_in_product_management | product management processes]] that interact with other divisions, such as updating sales on roadmaps, ensuring effective working relationships with sales, and [[building_trust_and_driving_impact_in_product_management | product marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>. It's important to note that ProdOps standardizes inter-team processes, not internal team practices like daily stand-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

## Impact on Scaling Product Management

By addressing the challenges of scaling, Product Operations enables [[getting_into_and_growing_in_product_management | product management]] to operate more smoothly and effectively. It ensures that:
*   Teams have the insights needed to make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
*   Processes are standardized across the organization, improving consistency and reducing friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>.
*   Product leaders can effectively monitor and track the progress of their strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.
*   Communication and collaboration across different departments are streamlined, fostering a unified approach to company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>.

Melissa Perri is currently writing a book on product operations, aiming for release by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>.

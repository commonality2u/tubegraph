Linear, a B2B SaaS product, is recognized for its beloved, beautifully designed, and fast-growing software, often cited as one of the fastest-growing in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Nonan You, Head of Product at Linear, shares insights into the company's unique approach to product development, emphasizing a philosophy that challenges conventional wisdom on speed, quality, and [[building_customer_relationships_and_gathering_feedback | customer proximity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Debunking the Speed vs. Quality Trade-off

Linear operates on the belief that there is no inherent trade-off between speed and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While many associate speed with rushing or sloppiness, Linear focuses on competence and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Top performers in any craft often demonstrate high quality by going fast, as it indicates a deep understanding and second nature to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This approach allows for more iterations, which is crucial for building a good product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

For Linear, speed in product development means having a workable solution very early in the development cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. For a feature expected to take a month, a functional prototype should be available within the first 10% of that time (e.g., after week one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This early prototype tests key hypotheses and allows for rapid validation or invalidation of assumptions, preventing wasted effort on features that don't pan out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This is enabled by having competent engineers who are comfortable making workable solutions even if they're not perfect, and a company culture that doesn't expect perfection in the first version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Iterative Release and Feedback Loops

Linear employs a phased release strategy to gather feedback:
1.  **Internal Use**: Features are first used internally by Linear's team, who rely on the product daily for their own work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
2.  **Beta Customer Group**: Once a feature reaches a sufficient level of quality (without corrupting data or appearing hideous), it's released to early beta customers for feedback and real-world problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Lack of engagement from this group serves as a strong signal that the product may not have hit the mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
3.  **Gradual Expansion**: The feature then moves through different beta audiences before a general release (GA) to all users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

This approach prioritizes getting ideas to users as early as possible (within the first 10% of allotted time) to get directional feedback and avoid building unwanted features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## Guarding Against Bloat: Prioritizing the Individual Contributor (IC)

A common criticism of enterprise software is that it becomes bloated over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Linear actively combats this by having a strict policy on feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. They "absolutely have to say no to" customization features requested by middle managers primarily for reporting purposes, especially if they make the Individual Contributor (IC) workflow worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

The core promise of Linear is not to make this trade-off between the IC's daily enjoyment and managerial reporting needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. While tempting for Product Managers to say yes to buyer-driven requests, Linear believes that compromising the IC experience leads to disengagement and inaccurate data, ultimately undermining the product's value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Linear aims to convince buyers that bloated features are precisely why their current systems are messy, and that a focused, efficient tool will lead to greater team effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.

## Deep Customer Understanding: Uncovering "Bad Feelings"

Nonan emphasizes that understanding customers goes beyond superficial feature requests. He aims to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. This means digging deep in customer calls, asking questions from various angles, to uncover the underlying emotional valence or "schlep blindness" that motivates their requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

For example, a user complaining about "marketing and I would just never align on anything" might reveal a deeper issue, like the stress of miscommunication due to perceived false precision in project deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>. Linear addressed this by allowing projects to specify target dates at varying levels of granularity (e.g., "Q4 project" instead of a specific date), preventing unnecessary miscommunication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

Another example is the "Customer Requests" feature, which emerged from users needing "fully customized fields" to track requests from specific clients like Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. Instead of adding custom fields that would burden ICs, Linear [[automating_customer_feedback_and_interaction | automated the process]] by integrating with customer support and CRM tools. This automatically tags escalated features with the customer's identity, providing crucial context to engineers without manual input and alleviating the "bad feeling" of disorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

[[the_importance_of_customer_proximity_in_product_design | Customer proximity]] and empathy are crucial for [[developing_user_empathy_and_gathering_insights_for_product_development | developing user empathy and gathering insights for product development]]. Nonan stresses the importance of tying feature debates back to specific, real-life user cases (e.g., "Bob from company X") rather than hypothetical scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. This ensures solutions match reality, even if reality is "ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

## Systematized Creativity: Exploring Extremes

To foster creativity and uncover non-obvious solutions, Linear employs a method of exploring extreme versions of product attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. This is akin to Brian Chesky's (Airbnb) "11-star experience" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>. The goal is to break past psychological constraints and defaults, expanding the possibility space for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.

For instance, when designing a draft-saving feature for issues, Linear explored two extremes:
1.  **Fastest Draft Saving**: No pop-ups, automatic discarding on close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>. This felt "super unsafe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.
2.  **Safest Draft Saving**: Aggressive autosave from the first character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This led to a "paper trail" of unwanted drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>.

By experiencing these extremes, Linear arrived at a balanced solution: interrupt the user only for brand new issues to confirm saving, but autosave all subsequent modifications to existing drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. This process of building and testing extreme versions, even if not intended for long-term use, provides crucial insights into the true "right answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. The choice of attributes to push to extremes should align with the core promise or value proposition of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.

## B2B Software as a "Teacher"

Linear views B2B software not just as a problem-solver but also as a teacher of "how to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. When a company adopts a B2B tool, they're often adopting the underlying processes and practices that the tool embodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>. This means a product implicitly brings a "baseline level of competency" to an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

This perspective reinforces Linear's [[the_linear_method_of_building_products_and_opinionated_software | opinionated software]] design. Instead of offering endless customization, Linear focuses on finding consensus among high-performing teams about effective practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>. They then automate these best practices, providing a simplified way for other companies to adopt them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. The refusal of unnecessary customization requests, particularly from middle managers seeking reporting features, is a direct manifestation of this opinionated stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. Users benefit from a streamlined, efficient workflow, reflecting Linear's vision of how a product team should operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

## The Double Triangle: PMs as Go-to-Market Discipline

Linear defines product management as a go-to-market discipline, alongside sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>. While the traditional "Triad" of engineering, product, and design is recognized, Linear emphasizes the crucial collaboration between product, sales, and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

Product Managers at Linear are expected to connect the "building side" with the "selling side" of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>. This means understanding the company's commercial goals and ensuring that what is built directly supports them, while also exploring possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. A key aspect of this is the PM's deep understanding of the customer's "native language," enabling them to help marketing originate effective messaging for campaigns and release notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. Sales, in turn, provides real-time feedback on message stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

## A Rigorous Approach to Deadlines

Linear's perspective on deadlines is pragmatic and strict: few deadlines, but when they exist, they are treated as "P-zero" problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>. This means everything else takes a backseat to hitting the deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. The PM's role becomes one of ruthlessly cutting scope to ensure the deadline is met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>.

This intensity is due to the understanding that marketing opportunities are finite (e.g., 50ish weeks in a year, 12 months, 4 quarters for major announcements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. Missing a launch opportunity means it's gone forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>. Linear does almost no estimating for deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>; instead, they focus on shipping an early, working version (the 10% rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a>. This early delivery allows the team to then decide whether to iterate further or polish the existing version to a shippable state, setting themselves up to make a "yes" or "no" decision on launch day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.

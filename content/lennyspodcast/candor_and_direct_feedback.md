[[impact_and_application_of_radical_candor_in_leadership | Candor]] is a foundational aspect of Netflix's culture, essential for fostering learning, continuous improvement, and the principle of freedom and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. This unique approach to feedback is deeply rooted in Netflix's origins, reflecting founder Reed Hastings' belief in building a company where people thrive and achieve excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

## Why Candor is Crucial
Maintaining a high [[high_talent_density_and_its_impact_on_company_culture | talent density]] requires engaging in conversations that might not feel "natural human behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. [[impact_and_application_of_radical_candor_in_leadership | Candor]] involves openly sharing expectations and providing feedback when they are not met, which is vital for individual and collective growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. Since no one is "a perfect human being" or remains so throughout their tenure, continuous growth and improvement necessitate direct and sometimes uncomfortable conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

## Framework for Delivering Feedback
Elizabeth Stone, CTO at Netflix, outlines a three-part framework for delivering effective feedback:
1.  **Set Clear Expectations** Managers must clearly communicate expectations regarding performance and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
2.  **Provide Specific Feedback** When expectations are not met, direct and specific feedback is crucial to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
3.  **Help Fill the Gap** Managers should actively assist individuals in closing the identified gaps, for example, by collaboratively working on a document or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. This hands-on support helps build trust and makes the feedback feel like a collaborative effort towards success, rather than criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

### Nuances of Feedback Delivery
*   **Privacy and Safety**: Feedback should ideally be delivered in a private, safe space, not "live in the big meeting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. This allows individuals to absorb the feedback without feeling exposed or embarrassed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on Outcome, Not Just Polish**: High standards do not necessarily equate to working excessive hours or perfecting every detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. The focus should be on achieving the desired outcome and fostering meaningful conversations, even if it means less "polish on the document" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

## Netflix's Approach to Performance and Feedback
Netflix operates without traditional performance reviews, instead relying on ongoing, real-time feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. While there is an annual 360-degree feedback cycle, it serves for reflection and distillation of themes, not as an input to a formal rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. This system aims to embed feedback into the "day-to-day" operating rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

### The "Keeper Test"
A key mental model for managers at Netflix is the "keeper test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. This involves managers regularly asking themselves: if this person on my team came to me today and said they were leaving for a different opportunity, would I do everything I could to keep them at Netflix? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. If the answer is no, it signals that a tough conversation about their fit or role may be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. This test encourages managers to have difficult conversations proactively, ensuring individuals are not surprised if a separation occurs, as feedback should have been consistent throughout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. While a heavy concept, it creates an openness for regular performance discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

### Transparency in Leadership
Netflix fosters [[improving_communication_skills | communication]] through transparent leadership, where information is shared freely and openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. Leaders like Elizabeth Stone take notes in leadership meetings and share them with the entire organization, providing context and fostering a sense of understanding about company discussions and priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. This approach pushes boundaries to ensure the team understands what's happening across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

### Adapting Cultural Practices: The Case of IC Levels
Netflix recently introduced individual contributor (IC) levels two years ago, a significant shift from a previous model where all engineers were simply "senior engineers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. This change was initially met with resistance, as many valued the previous lack of structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a>. However, as the organization scaled, a "scaffolding" was needed to discuss team composition, aligning different levels of experience with work requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>.

A "postmortem" or "retro" was held to candidly discuss how the implementation of IC levels had gone, acknowledging that it "hasn't all gone perfectly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. This willingness to openly reflect on challenges, rather than pretending everything is perfect, is a key example of candor that helps build community and trust within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>.

## Benefits of Candor and Direct Feedback
*   **Clearer Expectations**: Employees know exactly what is expected of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Growth**: Specific, actionable feedback with support helps individuals "uplevel themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.
*   **Reduced Stress**: Knowing how one is performing, even if it means areas for improvement, is often less stressful than uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.
*   **Stronger Teams**: Addressing performance gaps promptly prevents "toxic" behaviors or skill deficiencies from negatively impacting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement**: The culture of candor fosters an environment where learning and improvement are constant, essential for [[high_talent_density_and_its_impact_on_company_culture | high talent density]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

*   **Idea Generation:** AI can provide ideas for AI-enhanced products, aiding in brainstorming and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:49">[06:53:49]</a>.

Instead of replacing product managers, AI frees up their time from less strategic tasks, allowing them to focus on broader strategic aspects of product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:46">[23:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:37">[23:37:37]</a>.

## Collaboration with Research Scientists

A key aspect of the [[role_of_product_managers_in_ai | role of product managers in AI]] is the increasing need for comfort and collaboration with research scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:52">[09:34:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:51">[09:50:51]</a>. These scientists produce smart models for automation, personalization, and recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:53">[09:43:53]</a>. Product managers must learn to understand and approach researchers, navigating the inherent uncertainty of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:39">[09:54:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:21">[10:01:21]</a>. The goal is to find the intersection of user desirability, business viability, and technical feasibility provided by research scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:50">[10:47:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:23">[11:00:23]</a>.

## Strategic Integration of AI in Products

When considering the [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | impact of AI on product development]], product managers should:

*   **Problem-First Approach:** Avoid the "shiny object trap" by ensuring there is a clear problem or pain point that AI can solve in a smart way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:30">[13:19:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:41">[13:26:41]</a>.
*   **When Not to Use AI:** Do not use AI for Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) or to prove market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:08">[14:43:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:01">[15:20:01]</a>. Instead, fake the AI functionality with prototypes (e.g., Figma) to gauge user interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:05">[15:10:05]</a>.
*   **Data Requirements:** AI implementation relies heavily on data. While simple classification tasks might only need 15-20 labeled photos, complex applications like voice recognition or NLP require thousands of data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:02">[15:59:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:05">[16:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:09">[16:17:09]</a>. Product managers must consider data collection and leverage existing or adjacent product data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:04">[15:32:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.
*   **Build vs. Buy:** Large tech companies often need to collect and diversify their own data to train unique models to maintain quality and avoid homogeneity with competitors using the same data packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:42">[17:17:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:24">[17:51:24]</a>. Startups, often lacking sufficient data, might benefit more from leveraging existing public models like GPT or Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:15">[16:54:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:24">[17:10:24]</a>.
*   **Measuring Success:** A key responsibility of an AI PM is to determine the acceptable quality threshold for a product to launch, such as a specific accuracy percentage for a classification model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:46">[18:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:40">[18:21:40]</a>.

### Understanding AI Models

A machine learning "model" can be conceptualized as a "kid's brain" that learns from repeated information. By providing thousands of labeled images (e.g., cats and dogs), the model processes this data, identifies patterns, and can then predict with a probability what a new image represents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:30">[18:51:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:05">[19:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:44">[20:08:44]</a>. The output of training is often text (e.g., transcription from speech) or a probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:33">[19:47:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:34">[21:17:34]</a>.

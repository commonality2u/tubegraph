Growth in tech is a relatively new field, and there's a prevalent misconception that a dedicated growth team is essential from the outset to achieve growth [00:00:00]. However, this is "absolutely not true" [00:09:32]. For a company to initiate growth, the founder and founding team must first figure out how to drive that initial expansion, potentially up to **$1 million, $5 million, or even $10 million in ARR** [00:09:32]. Some companies don't even establish growth teams until they reach **$100 million or $200 million in ARR** [00:09:44].

## Why Founders Must Lead Early Growth

The initial wave of growth must be [[founderled_sales_strategies | founder-led]] for two primary reasons:

1.  **Achieving Product-Market Fit (PMF)**: Before building a growth team, a company needs to have a solid [[Growth strategies and achieving productmarket fit in startups | product-market fit]] [00:10:35]. This means having a solution to a problem where customers not only use the solution but also consistently retain and stay with the product, indicating good retention [00:10:46]. This foundational fit cannot be outsourced [00:00:40].
2.  **Sufficient Data for Experimentation**: A growth team cannot effectively function without a significant volume of data [00:11:09]. If a company only has **10 users or customers**, that's not enough data for analysis, hypothesis generation, or experimentation. Until there's enough user volume to learn from, optimize, and innovate on, a dedicated growth team is unnecessary [00:10:20].

Elena Verna, a leading expert in B2B growth, emphasizes that the concept of [[founderled_sales_strategies | founder-led growth]] is not popularized enough [00:10:13]. The longer founders maintain direct responsibility for growth, the better, as it trains the entire company to be accountable for growth, rather than isolating it to a single "growth island" team [00:12:07].

## When to Consider a Growth Team

For startups, the advice is clear: only hire a head of growth when you have clear product-market fit and operate as a [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led]] company, ideally beyond **$1 million ARR** [00:14:00]. If a company's revenue primarily comes through a sales team, it should prioritize hiring sales personnel "way before growth" [00:12:45]. Growth teams are particularly needed when a company is transitioning to self-serve revenue or when product-led motions are central to activation and monetization [00:13:30].

It is also crucial to avoid hiring a growth team to fix a declining business. A growth team can optimize and potentially lift growth by **10-15%** [00:16:04], but it cannot resolve deeper issues like core product or marketing problems causing a slowdown [00:16:17]. If the business is already declining, the focus should first be on stopping the decline and seeing signs of stabilization before introducing a growth team to accelerate growth [00:18:40]. Hiring a growth team in a decline is often a "huge waste of money" [00:17:32] with minimal ROI [00:17:47].

Storytelling is a significant buzzword in business, with many aspiring to be storytellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, truly being a storyteller means separating oneself from the "herd," which can feel risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The alternative, remaining in the herd, makes one forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Our minds are not designed to remember isolated facts, statistics, or platitudes; they remember ideas attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The risk of not telling stories is being forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Matthew Dicks, author of *Storyworthy* and a 59-time Moth Story Slam winner, teaches the skill of storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. His approach focuses on tactical methods for telling better stories in both life and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Core Components of a Compelling Story

### The Five-Second Moment
Every good story is centered around a singular "5-second moment" of either transformation or realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Transformation:** The storyteller describes how they used to be one kind of person and are now a new kind of person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Realization:** The storyteller used to think one thing, and after some events, they now think a new thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

These changes happen through an accumulation of events, feelings, and thoughts that culminate in one specific moment where the "flip" occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The purpose of a story is to bring this moment to the greatest clarity for the audience, allowing them to experience that change or realization alongside the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

The vast majority (98%) of a story provides context to bring this singular moment to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This applies to spoken stories, novels, movies, and television shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. For example, Star Wars is a story about Luke Skywalker's transformation from relying on technology to finding belief in the Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This resonates because audiences understand what it's like to find belief in something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Beginning and End in Opposition
When telling true stories about oneself or a company, the storyteller must know the end of the story because they have lived it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The end informs everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. A story is essentially about two moments in time – a beginning and an end – that operate in opposition to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This is why watching the first 10-15 minutes of a movie often reveals how it will end, such as in a romantic comedy where two people not in love at the beginning are expected to be in love at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

Starting at the end guarantees that the story has something important to say, rather than just reporting on events chronologically without leading to a meaningful conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### The Dinner Test
For formal storytelling (e.g., performing on stage, delivering a keynote, pitching), the story should be closely related to what you would tell someone at dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. This means avoiding "performance art" elements like unattributed dialogue or starting with sound effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The goal is a slightly elevated version of a natural conversation, free from verbal "detritus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

### Personal Story and Vulnerability
Stories should always be about you in some way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. If you tell a story about someone else, it can feel like fiction, and it's difficult to express vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. [[Empathy in storytelling and communication | Vulnerability]] is a key part of storytelling, offering a piece of your heart and mind to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. While you can include elements about others, the story should always center on how their experience has informed or changed *your* life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

### The Importance of Change
A moment of [[The role of change and transformation in storytelling | transformation]] lends importance to a story and allows the audience to connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Reporting on daily events may not connect with a diverse audience, but when focusing on change, the story gains universal appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Even if the content is unrelated, the emotional appeal of change causes people to connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

## [[Techniques to add stakes and suspense in storytelling | Adding Stakes and Suspense]]

[[Techniques to add stakes and suspense in storytelling | Stakes]] are what the audience should be worried about or wondering about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. If the audience isn't wondering what you're about to say, they're no longer listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

Techniques to build stakes:
*   **Elephant:** Plant a big problem or concern at the beginning of the story to immediately indicate what's at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. It doesn't have to be the core of the story, but it gets the audience engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.
*   **Backpack:** Tell the audience your plan or hopes before you carry it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. This allows them to feel your hopes and dreams, making them worry when things go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Offer hints of what's going on without revealing the complete idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   **Hourglass:** When the audience is on the edge of their seat, slow time down by loading the story with details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. Prolong the moment of suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.
*   **Crystal Ball:** Predict a future (even a false one) to make the audience worried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

### The Power of Surprise
[[Techniques to add stakes and suspense in storytelling | Surprise]] is a delightful moment where the audience didn't see something coming, yet it feels inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. For a surprise to be effective, there must be enough information placed earlier in the story so that when it happens, the audience understands why it occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. The storyteller must be clever enough to plant this information without giving away the surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

## Incorporating Humor

Humor is a brilliant, beautiful, and simple way to differentiate yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. Being funny requires taking a risk, as you believe something is funny and expect the audience to agree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.

Techniques to add humor:
*   **Nostalgia:** Speaking nostalgically about the past can be funny because of how much things have changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. This is useful when introducing new products or services by contrasting them with older methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. It also demonstrates expertise in your field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>.
*   **"One of these things is not like the other":** Present three things – two expected, and one unexpected – to create a humorous effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.

When using humor, ensure it's within the confines of a story, so even if a joke doesn't land, you're still telling a coherent narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>.

## [[Importance of storytelling in business communication | Storytelling in Business]]

If you don't tell stories in business, you become forgettable and mediocre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. Most business communication is "round, white, and flavorless," often because people are afraid to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. Businesses often believe audiences want to hear data, but people forget facts and statistics quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

Benefits of storytelling in business:
*   **Memorable:** Stories make your message unforgettable. For instance, a speaker telling a personal story with a childhood lunchbox was remembered long after a conference, while another fluent speaker was forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.
*   **Connection:** Stories allow you to connect with your audience on a human level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. For example, a corporate communications director at Slack found that sharing a 30-second personal anecdote about feeling lonely during the pandemic led to deeper connections with her audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.
*   **Influence:** Stories can convey values and inspire action more effectively than direct commands. A factory owner used a story about his son striking out in baseball to teach his sales team to move past failure quickly, rather than directly telling them to stop sulking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. This is an example of the [[Role of storytelling in sales | role of storytelling in sales]].
*   **Differentiation:** By telling stories, you become an individual remembered for your color and flavor, not just a corporate spokesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.
*   **Relatability:** Incorporate aspects of your personal life in strategic ways. Use a "personal interest inventory" to identify things about yourself that might resonate with others (e.g., being married, hobbies like running) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. When asked a question, try to include a piece of your personality or life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
*   **Speaking with Adjacency:** Instead of matching content directly (e.g., talking about tubes to sell tubes), match theme, meaning, or message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>. A scientist selling tubes used a story about buying different types of apples for his family to convey that his company provides tailored solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. This creates a powerful "snap" when the audience realizes the deeper connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>. This also makes advertising inherent in people's lives without them even being aware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>.

## Building a Bank of Stories: Homework for Life

"Homework for Life" is a daily practice where you reflect on your day and find one moment worth telling as a story, writing it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.
*   **Method:** Use an Excel spreadsheet with two columns: date and a space to write the moment (e.g., the length of a computer screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>. The goal is to find one new moment per month, but people often find many more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   **Developing a Storytelling Lens:** This practice helps you develop a "lens" for storytelling, seeing moments you didn't notice before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. While not every moment becomes a full story (about 10% do), the other 90% are still valuable for "holding on to your days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>.
*   **Recovering Time:** Homework for Life helps you recover your time and slow time down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>. Instead of feeling like time flies because days are forgotten, you account for each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>.
*   **Seeing Patterns:** This practice helps you see patterns in your life that you might not otherwise notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. For example, realizing you "fight" with your spouse indirectly through chores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. It also helps you recover forgotten memories from the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

## [[Crafting compelling presentations | Overcoming Public Speaking Nerves]]

Public speaking is a common fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>.
*   **Pre-talk Nervousness:** Most nervousness occurs *before* you begin speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Once you start, much of it falls away, especially if you're prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>.
*   **Universal Experience:** Everyone gets nervous when speaking, so you're not alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.
*   **Preparation:**
    *   **Record and Listen:** Record your talk or pitch and listen to it passively while doing other activities (e.g., chores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. This allows the content to "seep into your soul" and become part of you, making it easier to recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
    *   **Practice Transitions:** Most people forget transitions in their talks, not the main content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Actively listen for where one section closes out and the next begins, practicing only the transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:26">[01:23:26]</a>.
    *   **Avoid Memorizing:** Memorizing a talk can lead to suffering if you forget a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Aim to remember the structure and key points without strict memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>.

### Starting a Story: Location and Action
To immediately grab an audience's attention and signal that you're telling a story:
1.  **Start with Location:** Location activates imagination, allowing the audience to visualize the setting with clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>.
2.  **Start with Action:** Something needs to be happening right away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. This indicates that the story is moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:08">[01:39:08]</a>.

This technique signals to people that "the movie's on," and they will get quiet and afford you the opportunity to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.

## The Power of Saying "Yes"

Saying "yes" to opportunities, even seemingly crazy or undesirable ones, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>. Saying "no" presumes you already know what's on the other side of a door, which is foolish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:52">[01:26:52]</a>.
*   **Explore:** A "yes" can always become a "no" later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>. You can step through the door, try something, and if it's not for you, step back out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>.
*   **Unforeseen Benefits:** Saying "yes" to things you initially don't want to do can lead to the most extraordinary opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>. It can create causal chains, forcing you to meet new people and open different doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:32">[01:29:32]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Fear:** When something scares you, that is often when you should pursue it most quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>. The things that frighten us are often the best for us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:15">[01:29:15]</a>.

Agile methodologies represent a movement started by software developers to improve how software is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. The core aim of [[Design and innovation in software development | agile methodologies]] is to enable teams to move quickly, deliver great value to customers, and obtain feedback faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.

## History and Core Principles

The Agile Manifesto, written in 2001 by a group of developers, set out guidelines for better software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">[01:47:48]</a>. These developers, including Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland (who codified Scrum), and others working on methods like Kanban, XP (Extreme Programming), Behavioral Driven Development, and Feature Driven Development, sought to push the boundaries of software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. A key principle was to move away from "waterfall" development, where products were built for years without customer feedback, which introduced significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:33">[01:54:33]</a>. Agile advocates for breaking down work into smaller chunks to get feedback faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a>.

## Scrum and the Product Owner Role

Scrum, a widely adopted agile framework, defines roles including developers, a Scrum Master (who helps teams do Scrum better), and a Product Owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:05">[01:39:05]</a>. The Product Owner's responsibility, as outlined in the Scrum Guide, is to maximize the value of work done and define what goes into the backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:05">[01:26:05]</a>.

### Evolution of the Product Owner

Initially, the Scrum Guide (first version) suggested that for commercial development, the Product Owner could be the Product Manager, and for in-house efforts, it could be a user department manager or internal customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a>. However, later versions, particularly the 2013 Scrum Guide, removed the explicit mention of the Product Manager, leading to a misconception of the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>.

Historically, the Product Owner role emerged not from product management as it's known today, but as a way to help developers prioritize their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. This often meant Product Owners became "order takers," focused on gathering requirements and populating backlogs, rather than engaging in strategic activities like market research, experimentation, or data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:05">[01:55:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:05">[02:27:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:05">[03:37:05]</a>.

## [[Scaled Agile Framework SAFe | Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)]]

[[Scaled Agile Framework SAFe | SAFe]] emerged from the desire to scale Scrum and other processes for very large organizations, especially non-tech companies that traditionally didn't grow up [[Building and evolving a software product | building software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:05">[02:36:05]</a>. Developed by Dean Leffingwell, SAFe aims to provide a structured approach to agile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:05">[02:46:05]</a>. It is marketed as a complete operating model for software development, often appealing to executives in large enterprises because it provides a "plug-and-play" map with detailed definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:05">[02:48:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:05">[03:42:05]</a>.

### Criticisms and Challenges of SAFe

*   **Role Duplication and Split**: SAFe often creates a split between Product Managers (who handle discovery and strategy) and Product Owners (who are more tactical, working with teams and managing backlogs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:05">[02:20:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:05">[03:21:05]</a>. This can lead to Product Owners becoming "order takers" without the strategic experience needed for advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:05">[03:37:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:05">[03:59:05]</a>.
*   **Over-prescription and Rigidity**: SAFe is considered overkill, creating too many meetings and a focus on process over outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:05">[03:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:05">[03:17:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:05">[03:56:05]</a>. This can destroy productivity and distract from core business goals, as exemplified by a water company that went bankrupt due to process over product delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:05">[05:00:05]</a>.
*   **Lack of Strategic Guidance**: SAFe doesn't adequately describe how to perform key product management functions like customer research, market analysis, or defining portfolio visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:05">[03:40:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:05">[04:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:05">[04:40:05]</a>. It also lacks defined roles for higher-level product leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:05">[03:40:05]</a>.
*   **Leader Reliance**: It takes away responsibility from leaders to figure out their own operating models, offering a tempting "handbook" but only solving a small part of the overall product development puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:05">[03:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:05">[03:40:05]</a>.

> "I do not recommend using safe. Every single person I have talked to who like safe found success with safe they ended up ripping it up and making it into something else." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:05">[04:22:05]</a>

Many companies that adopted SAFe have since abandoned or significantly modified it, such as Capital One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:05">[03:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:05">[03:59:05]</a>.

## [[Adoption and challenges of agile and scrum in large organizations | Adoption in Large Organizations]]

Large, non-software native companies (e.g., banks, insurance, pharmaceutical) often turn to frameworks like Scrum or SAFe to implement rigor and improve their software development capabilities, especially as digital transformation becomes critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:05">[02:36:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:05">[03:55:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:05">[04:00:05]</a>. These companies are looking for structure because they may not have grown up [[Building and evolving a software product | building software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:05">[02:40:05]</a>.

However, smaller, product-first tech companies (like Google, Amazon, Netflix) typically do not employ Product Owners; they use Product Managers, focusing on outcomes rather than just process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:05">[02:21:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:05">[02:42:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:05">[03:05:05]</a>.

### For Leaders

*   **Holistic Operating Model**: Don't just focus on a development operating model. Consider product strategy, organizational design, product operations (infrastructure for data and customer access), and culture/incentives that reward value over output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:05">[04:19:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:05">[04:21:05]</a>.
*   **Strategic Alignment**: Ensure a clear product strategy that ties back to company goals and enables transparency across thousands of teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:05">[04:36:05]</a>.
*   **Skilled Talent**: Intersperse experienced product leaders (e.g., CPOs, VPs, Directors) and individual contributors who can mentor and train existing staff. A mix of internal upskilling and external hires is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:05">[04:38:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:05">[05:22:05]</a>.
*   **Career Paths**: Establish clear career paths for product roles, from Associate Product Manager to CPO, avoiding confusion between "Product Owner" and "Product Manager" titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:05">[04:50:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:05">[05:50:05]</a>.
*   **C-Suite Commitment**: Digital transformation requires buy-in and leadership from the C-suite, not just middle management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:05">[04:17:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:05">[04:20:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:05">[04:24:05]</a>.

### For Product Owners

If you are a Product Owner, focus on developing product management skills and demonstrating value:

*   **Shift Mindset**: Recognize that your role is more than just working with developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:05">[05:16:05]</a>.
*   **Seek Strategic Exposure**: Ask to participate in customer research and strategic discussions with Product Managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:05">[05:51:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on Outcomes**: Frame your work in terms of the value delivered to users and the business, not just tasks completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:05">[05:28:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:05">[05:55:05]</a>.
*   **Question and Challenge**: Ask leaders, "What do we hope will happen when we release this? What metrics will change?" This helps shift the focus to outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:05">[05:59:05]</a>.
*   **Advocate for Career Path**: Inquire about your career trajectory to prompt leaders to address growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:05">[05:47:05]</a>.
*   **Resume Strategy**: Describe your achievements from a value perspective (e.g., "enhanced security for login protocols, resulting in meeting compliance and saving millions"), not just agile processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:05">[06:27:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:05">[06:33:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:05">[06:38:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:05">[06:45:05]</a>. Consider using "Product Owner / Product Manager" on your resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:05">[06:29:05]</a>.
*   **Certifications**: Be wary of agile certifications (like Certified Scrum Product Owner - CSPO) that involve short, two-day classes, as they may not indicate true product management skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:05">[06:44:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:05">[07:06:05]</a>. Most tech organizations value experience over these certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:05">[07:28:05]</a>.
*   **Consider Internal/External Moves**: If your organization does not support true product management, consider moving to a different division or a new company that aligns better with these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:05">[06:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:05">[06:05:05]</a>.

> "Take scrum away you still need product management, right? Like product owner doesn't exist without scrum that's not a thing but you still need product managers and that's why all product owners should be product managers they should be fundamentally product managers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:05">[05:15:05]</a>

There is no "plug-and-play" or "quick way" to achieve successful product development. It requires continuous learning, adaptation, and a focus on delivering value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:05">[07:32:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:05">[07:51:05]</a>. Organizations, including those not traditionally software-native, can achieve success by adopting these principles and ensuring that software strategy is intertwined with overall company strategy at the C-suite level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:05">[08:21:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:05">[08:28:05]</a>.

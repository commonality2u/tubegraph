Matt Mochary, an executive coach who has worked with CEOs from companies like OpenAI, Coinbase, and Notion, emphasizes that learning to fire people humanely is one of the most crucial skills for a leader to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Many managers struggle with this because they perceive it as hurting the person being laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. However, when handled well, layoffs can actually improve company performance and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.

## The Importance of a Humane Approach

The most significant indicator separating a botched layoff from a successful one is *how* the individual receives the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.
*   **Successful Layoff**: The employee hears the news directly from their manager in a one-on-one conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.
*   **Botched Layoff**: The news is delivered via email, group chat, or in a public setting alongside other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. This impersonal approach is terrible and leads to anger, public outcry on social media, and a feeling of dehumanization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. It denies the person the courtesy of a face-to-face conversation and the ability to express their emotions privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.

## The Decision vs. Implementation Framework

We Dang, CEO of Clipboard Health, provides a valuable framework: separating the decision from its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
1.  **The Decision**: This should prioritize the customer's needs, meaning the company should ideally have only the best employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
2.  **The Implementation**: This addresses the emotional impact on all stakeholders:
    *   **The Employee Being Laid Off**: They are hurt by the job loss, but they ultimately want a great job where they are needed, feel fulfilled, and are critical to the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. By holding them back in a role where they aren't critical, you are hindering their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.
    *   **The Manager**: They want to avoid a difficult conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. Mochary suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy demonstrates that the best way to overcome this fear is to actually have the conversation and realize it's not as bad as anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.
    *   **The Remaining Team**: They feel sad because their colleague is leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. They need to release these emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>.

### Becoming an Agent

A key component of a humane layoff is for the manager to become an "agent" for the departing employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. This means actively helping them find their next job, similar to how a talent agent would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. This involves reaching out to one's network, identifying roles that align with the person's skills and passions, and actively recommending them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>. This active support is crucial; a passive offer of a reference is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

## Tactical Steps for Layoffs

Mochary outlines a three-part process for conducting large-scale layoffs humanely:

1.  **Individual Notification and Support (Morning)**:
    *   **Inner Circle Planning**: The leadership team decides how much cost needs to be cut (preferably in dollar amounts, not just number of people, to avoid letting go of valuable junior staff) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.
    *   **Manager Choice**: Each manager is given a financial target for their team and is responsible for deciding who to let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>. This avoids department heads making decisions that could be detrimental to a specific team's cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.
    *   **One-on-One Meetings**: Managers schedule individual 15-minute meetings, back-to-back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.
    *   **The Difficult Conversation**:
        *   **Preparation**: Start by warning the individual that it will be a difficult conversation and ask if they are ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. This helps prevent the amygdala from being triggered by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
        *   **Delivery**: State clearly that they are being let go and briefly explain why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
        *   **Emotional Release**: Acknowledge that they are likely feeling anger, fear, or sadness, and invite them to share their thoughts and feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.
        *   **[[Techniques for effective customer communication and empathy | Active Listening]]**: Make them feel heard by actively listening and reflecting back what you understand they are feeling, even their unexpressed thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.
        *   **Agent Offer**: Offer to be their agent to help them find their next dream job, scheduling a follow-up meeting for this specific purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.

2.  **All-Hands Meeting for Remaining Team (Afternoon)**:
    *   **Transparency**: Inform the remaining employees about the layoffs, explaining why they occurred (e.g., fiscal responsibility in uncertain economic times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.
    *   **Address Fears**: Answer questions, particularly those driven by fear like "Is this going to happen to me?" or "Does this mean the company is dying?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.
    *   **Commitment**: Reassure the "stay team" that they are the core group with whom the company will be built going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.
    *   **Cut Deep**: Emphasize that the cuts were made deep enough to avoid multiple rounds of layoffs, which cause "PTSD" and trauma within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>.

3.  **One-on-One Follow-ups with Remaining Team (Within two weeks)**:
    *   **Emotional Processing**: Each manager conducts an hour-long one-on-one meeting with every remaining direct report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.
    *   **Open Dialogue**: The manager's sole purpose is to invite the employee to share their thoughts and feelings about the layoffs (sadness for friends, anger at perceived irresponsibility, fear for job security) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>.
    *   **[[Techniques for effective customer communication and empathy | Active Listening]]**: The manager actively listens and makes the employee feel heard by repeating back their emotions and thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. This process reduces the emotional impact by about 25%, enough to prevent rash decisions like quitting or spreading negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

Following these steps can lead to the company performing better within two weeks, as opposed to 60 days if the follow-ups are omitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

## Benefits of Strategic Layoffs

Mochary's experience coaching companies through layoffs during economic downturns (like March 2020 and mid-2022) revealed a surprising outcome: companies often operated *better* with fewer people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.
*   **Reduced Overhead**: Every additional person in an organization creates extra overhead due to the need to keep them informed, provide context, and ensure they feel heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.
*   **Improved Efficiency**: Fewer people reduce "information friction" and morale problems, leading to smoother operations, more features, better code output, and higher NPS scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.
*   **Focus and Clarity**: Keeping teams super small, as exemplified by companies like WhatsApp, Instagram, [[unique_hiring_practices_and_company_culture_at_linear | Linear]], and Notion, leads to real success stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

Mochary has guided companies through over 40 layoff processes, constantly iterating and A/B testing approaches to refine these methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. While the emotional recovery for the "stay team" might take longer if handled poorly (e.g., via email), the company generally still performs better within a couple of months due to the inherent benefits of reduced headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.

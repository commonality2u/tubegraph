37signals, co-founded and led by Jason Fried, operates with a distinct philosophy that challenges conventional wisdom in the tech industry, particularly concerning company growth, financial models, and [[Effective decision making | decision-making]] processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Unlike most tech companies, 37signals has no external investors, no board, no plans for public offering, and no intention to sell the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. This deliberate choice for independence underpins their unique [[Leadership and company culture | company culture]] and approach to business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

## The Bootstrapped Model: A Different Path to Success

Jason Fried advocates for bootstrapping, arguing that it forces entrepreneurs to become proficient at the fundamental skill of making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. He highlights that while venture capital (VC) funding is often presented as the only path to success ("go big or go home") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>, almost nobody truly succeeds this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

37signals has been profitable for 24 consecutive years, generating tens of millions of dollars in profit annually, which most VC-backed companies never achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. This profit is distributed among founders and employees due to the absence of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

### Why Bootstrapping?
*   **Focus on Profit:** Unlike VC-backed companies that prioritize rapid growth at the expense of early profitability, 37signals focuses on making more money than they spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:01">[05:51:01]</a>.
*   **Control over Costs:** Bootstrapping instills discipline in managing costs, as there's no large cushion of external funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:01">[28:50:01]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Outlier" Goals:** The VC model typically demands a "go huge" outcome, which is an extreme outlier in the business world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:01">[09:29:01]</a>. Bootstrapping allows for a wider range of successful outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:52:01">[29:52:01]</a>.
*   **Independence:** Not having investors means no one can dictate the company's direction or force an exit strategy, allowing the founders to shape the business as they wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:01">[19:41:01]</a>.

> "Most Founders by default will go down the Venture route raising money from VCS and angels and for many types of companies that is necessary but it's also important to know that there is a different option available and it can be much more fulfilling and fun and even much more lucrative by bootstrapping your idea." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>

## Company Structure and Operations

37signals, with about 75 employees, contrasts sharply with competitors like Asana (1,600 employees), ClickUp (1,000), and Slack (2,500), which have similar customer bases but generally do not make a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:01">[10:06:01]</a>. This lean structure is a core tenet of their [[Leadership and company culture | culture]].

### Small Teams and Constraints
*   **Efficiency over Growth:** 37signals prioritizes efficiency over aggressive growth, avoiding the need for large sales teams or complex tiered offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:01">[10:36:01]</a>.
*   **Simplified Product Offerings:** They offer one product (Basecamp) with largely one price, avoiding the complexity of servicing many different types of companies with varied expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:01">[11:13:01]</a>.
*   **Two-Person Project Teams:** Every feature is developed by a team of two: one programmer and one designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:01">[12:01:01]</a>.
*   **"Shape Up" Methodology:** Their development framework, "Shape Up," mandates that any feature can take no longer than six weeks (an "appetite," not an "estimate") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39:01">[33:39:01]</a>. This prevents projects from dragging on and demoralizing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:01">[37:11:01]</a>.
*   **Cool-down Periods:** After each six-week "cycle" (they avoid the term "sprint" as it implies exhaustion), teams have a two-week cool-down period for internal freelancing, bug fixing, or exploring side projects, allowing for rejuvenation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:01">[42:49:01]</a>.

> "Constraints, simplicity, small teams actually are where it's at and and keep us honest and allow us to do great work for our customer base that we know small businesses very very tight kind of companies like ours and satisfy them versus trying to you know go after the big companies." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:01">[12:49:01]</a>

## Decision Making: The Power of Gut and Intuition

Central to 37signals' [[Leadership and company culture | culture]] and [[Impact of culture on team dynamics and decision making | decision-making]] is a strong reliance on instinct, gut feelings, and subjective "feelings" rather than solely quantitative data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:56:01">[43:56:01]</a>.

### The "Judgment Call" Approach
*   **Intuition-Driven:** Jason Fried admits he doesn't know how to make decisions solely by numbers, finding no joy in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:01">[44:17:01]</a>. He believes every decision is ultimately a judgment call, influenced by thousands of known and unknown factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:37:01">[44:37:01]</a>.
*   **Hiring for Judgment:** When hiring executives, companies seek judgment and experience, which are amorphous qualities indicating the ability to absorb and apply countless experiences to make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:00:01">[45:00:01]</a>.
*   **"What do you think?" vs. "What do you know?":** This subtle shift in questioning encourages team members to access their intuition and express their subjective feelings about products, flows, and designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:43:01">[47:43:01]</a>.
*   **Hiring Process:** For designers and product people, 37signals tasks candidates with a paid project, then critiques it, pushing them to articulate their immediate, gut-level ideas for further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:42:01">[51:42:01]</a>. This reveals their ability to "play" with ideas and their natural instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:50:01">[54:50:01]</a>.

> "I'm comfortable admitting that that I don't really know why I'm making these calls but I'm making these calls regardless and I'm not looking at number and going if this is 51% versus 49 I'm going this way for sure that could be an input perhaps but it's not the only input." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:46:01">[45:46:01]</a>

### Rejecting Long-Term Planning
*   **"Business planning is a fantasy":** 37signals avoids long-term planning, preferring to operate in the "now" and make decisions every six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:01">[01:52:01]</a>. This allows them to remain agile and adapt to current thoughts and feelings rather than being bound by past assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:01">[03:06:01]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Promises:** They've learned to avoid making promises for future deliverables, especially long-term ones like "by the end of the year," as these often lead to missed targets and disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:01">[38:43:01]</a>.

## Work Isn't War: A Different Ethos

37signals actively rejects the use of "war metaphors" prevalent in business jargon (e.g., "conquer the market," "target customers," "destroy the competition") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:01">[10:55:01]</a>. This linguistic choice is fundamental to their [[Impact of culture on team dynamics and decision making | company culture]] and how they perceive their work.

> "If you go into it with with destruction of mind you're going to you're going to end up in a pretty dark place." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26">[01:11:26]</a>

They emphasize a [[Cultivating an entrepreneurial culture within organizations | spirit of creation]], pride, and excitement, focusing on building great alternatives rather than "beating" competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.

## The "Once" Product Line: Embracing Novelty

Their latest venture, the "Once" product line, is a prime example of their experimental and non-traditional approach. "Once" will offer business software products that users pay for *once* and install on their own servers, eliminating subscription fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.

### Key Aspects of "Once":
*   **Challenging SaaS Dominance:** They believe there's "subscription fatigue" and that a pendulum swing back to owned software is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.
*   **Commodity Approach:** They seek out software categories that have become commodities but are still priced like luxuries (e.g., chat tools), and aim to create "beautifully tight, simple, essential generics" of high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:10">[01:25:10]</a>.
*   **Self-Hosting & Code Access:** Users will manage their own instances, and critically, will receive the source code, allowing for modification and customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.
*   **First Product: Campfire:** They are relaunching Campfire, an early group chat tool (predating Slack), as the first "Once" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:48">[01:26:48]</a>. It's designed to be simple, effective, and very low-cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>.
*   **Minimalist Design:** The first "Once" product aims to use as few words as possible, making it universally accessible and reducing the need for localization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:44">[01:29:44]</a>.

This venture represents a new [[Cultivating an entrepreneurial culture within organizations | creative exploration]] for the company, demonstrating their commitment to an alternative perspective in the software industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

The [[Metas corporate culture and management | corporate culture]] at 37signals, led by Jason Fried, emphasizes simplicity, independence, and a human-centered approach to work and [[Decision making and leadership in highgrowth environments | decision-making]].

*   **Embrace Simplicity:** Things are hard, but they're simple until you complicate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>.
*   **Profitability over Growth:** Prioritizing making money over relentless growth fosters discipline and sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.
*   **Trust Your Gut:** Human intuition and feeling are powerful, underappreciated tools in decision-making, complementing data rather than being subservient to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:30">[01:45:30]</a>. This concept will be the focus of Fried's next book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:29">[01:45:29]</a>.
*   **Stay Connected:** Keeping the business "stick shift" – direct, tangible, and free from excessive layers of abstraction – helps maintain a connection to the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:57">[01:43:57]</a>.
*   **"Stay Up" Mentality:** While starting a business is easy, *staying* in business is the harder part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. Longevity and enduring plateaus require a genuine love for the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:01">[02:14:01]</a>. This aligns with concepts in [[Psychology in marketing and decisionmaking | psychology in marketing and decision-making]], where intrinsic motivation sustains effort.
*   **Worry Less:** Many anxieties about the future never materialize, making excessive worry a futile exercise that saps energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:21">[01:44:21]</a>.

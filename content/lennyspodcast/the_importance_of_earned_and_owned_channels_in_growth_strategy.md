Growth teams often make the mistake of prioritizing channels like SEO (organic search), SEM (paid search), and social media advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>. While these channels can bring in traffic, they ultimately make platforms like Google richer by paying for distribution and access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>. Reliance on social media also means operating within algorithms that can change and take away your reach at any point, leaving you with no control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.

As search interfaces evolve towards AI, giving less credit to traditional content, focusing on channels you own becomes paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. If earned and owned channels are not on your [[marketing_strategies_and_growth | growth roadmap]], businesses risk significantly higher costs of acquisition and increased competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.

## What Are Earned and Owned Channels?

Earned and owned channels align with the concept of [[productled_growth_strategy | Product-Led Growth (PLG)]] acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. These are channels where you have direct control and are not subject to the whims of external platforms or algorithms. They are built upon intrinsic value and user engagement.

Key components include:
*   **Virality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>
*   **Word of Mouth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>
*   **User-Generated Content (UGC)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>
*   **Community Building** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>

### Examples of Earned Channels

*   **Dropbox's Sharing Model**: Over 50% of Dropbox's acquisition comes through its sharing functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>. When a user uploads content and shares it for signature, transfer, or final delivery, the recipient becomes aware of Dropbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. This act of sharing activates the recipient and accounts for a significant portion of new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. This is a stable, earned channel that no competitor can replicate or buy access to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>.
*   **Miroverse**: Miro developed Miroverse, a library of user-generated content (Miro boards and templates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. It took approximately 18 months before metrics expectations were placed on it, but it eventually took off as both an engagement and acquisition engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>.
*   **User-Generated Content (UGC)**: Leveraging user-generated templates, case studies, or reviews can be a powerful content strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. Investing in creating a library of UGC and using it for activation and acquisition purposes is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>.
*   **Referral Mechanisms**: For B2C products, referrals are straightforward and often thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>. For B2B, this can involve inviting other team members into the product to complete tasks, leading to organic spread within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.

## Strategic Imperatives for Growth Teams

Growth teams should create their own earned or owned channels where nobody else can compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. This means focusing on tactics that rely on virality, word of mouth, and user-generated content to attract new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.

> "If you don't have them on your [[marketing_strategies_and_growth | growth road map]] you're going to be in some really big trouble over the next year to two years because your cost of acquisition is only going to go up your competition in those channel is only going to go up you're constantly going to be praying to log uh algorithm Gods to giveth your way but they again they can take it at any point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>

While it costs significant product, engineering, and marketing resources to establish these channels, they are not expensive in terms of budget like paid marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. These channels are applicable to more products than people realize, as most products have some form of team functionality or roles that can drive recommendations and user-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

The key advice is to diversify your [[marketing_strategies_and_growth | growth strategy]], so not all acquisition is reliant on third-party access to distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. When an earned channel is successfully established, it becomes "a gift that just keeps on giving," and no one can take that away from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>.

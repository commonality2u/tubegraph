Linear, a leading B2B SaaS product, has achieved remarkable success and customer loyalty by actively working to avoid product bloat, a common pitfall in enterprise software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15"></a>. Nonan You, Head of Product at Linear, shares insights into their philosophy and strategies for maintaining a fast, high-quality, and user-loved product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51"></a>. Their success demonstrates a unique approach to [[the_process_of_achieving_productmarket_fit_in_b2b_saas | product-market fit]] and [[b2b_growth_and_consumerization | B2B growth]], especially in the enterprise space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08"></a>.

## No Trade-Off Between Speed and Quality

Linear operates on the belief that there isn't an actual trade-off between speed and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03"></a>. People often mistakenly associate speed with rushing or sloppiness, when it should be associated with competence and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15"></a>. Highly skilled individuals in any craft typically produce high-quality work quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25"></a>.

For Linear, speed means that within 10% of a feature's rough time budget, a workable solution exists that tests a key hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42"></a>. This allows them to quickly validate assumptions and avoid wasting time on incorrect paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06"></a>. This approach is enabled by:
*   **Talented Engineers:** Who are capable of quickly creating workable solutions without getting bogged down by minor design choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45"></a>.
*   **No Expectation of Perfection:** The first version is considered a best guess in the general direction, not the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05"></a>. The goal is to get something functional to validate or invalidate major assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31"></a>.

This mindset aligns with Patrick Collison's view that "good cheap fast" isn't a trade-off but rather that "slow and expensive usually go together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53"></a>.

### Iteration and Feedback Circles
To move faster without sacrificing quality, Linear employs a strategy of incrementally expanding the user base for new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04"></a>:
1.  **Internal Users:** Initial versions are used daily by Linear's own team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19"></a>.
2.  **Beta Customer Group:** Once a feature reaches a minimum level of quality, it's released to early access customers for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29"></a>.
3.  **Gradual Release:** Multiple beta audiences are engaged before the general release (GA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54"></a>.

This systematic approach minimizes wasted time on [[building_and_scaling_product_innovations | building products]] that no one wants by getting directional feedback early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20"></a>.

## Opinionated Software: Prioritizing Individual Contributors (ICs)

A core strategy for avoiding bloat at Linear is a strict policy on feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44"></a>. They categorize requests into those that can be debated and those that are absolutely rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48"></a>.

The features they absolutely say "no" to are customization requests from middle managers aimed at simplifying reporting, particularly when these come at the cost of worsening the workflow for individual contributors (ICs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05"></a>. This is a core promise of Linear: they will not make this specific trade-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27"></a>.

*   **The Problem with Middle Manager Requests:** PMs often feel pressure from buyers and sales to implement these features, believing they will close deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50"></a>. However, Linear argues this is a false trade-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10"></a>. If the IC user experience degrades, ICs will disengage, leading to inaccurate or sparse data, making reporting useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19"></a>.
*   **The Alternative:** Linear focuses on solving the primary problems buyers care aboutâ€”making their teams more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31"></a>. By declining custom reporting features, they aim to convince buyers that those features are the *reason* for current inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49"></a>.
*   **Win-Win Outcomes:** The goal is to find solutions that benefit both managers and ICs. For example, instead of custom fields for tracking customers, Linear integrated with customer support and CRM tools to automatically tag issues with customer information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33"></a>. This makes ICs more confident by providing context without manual effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54"></a>.

This approach means Linear often says "no" to deals that require specific customization, but their long-term success indicates this disciplined approach pays off, allowing them to grow in the enterprise market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08"></a>. They offer a strong [[differentiated_value_in_b2b_markets | differentiated value]] by being an opinionated tool that teaches companies "best practices" in how to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51"></a>.

## Deep Customer Understanding: Feeling Their Pain

To build the right features and avoid unnecessary ones, Linear emphasizes deep customer understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39"></a>. Nonan's approach to customer calls is to "keep digging and digging until you get to something that is an insight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32"></a>. His goal is to "feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11"></a>.

*   **Beyond Surface-Level Requests:** Instead of just building what customers ask for (e.g., "custom fields"), he probes to understand the underlying emotional valence motivating the request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35"></a>. For example, a PM's frustration with deadlines might reveal a need for flexible target date options, not just better tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35"></a>.
*   **Finding "Schlep Blindness":** Inspired by Paul Graham, Nonan seeks moments where users are "schlepping through life" without realizing there's a better way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51"></a>. These are opportunities for automation that users might not explicitly ask for, but which dramatically improve their experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17"></a>.
*   **Example: Triage Management:** Linear's triage management feature stemmed from observing two feelings: users manually managing issues and feeling "underwater," or feeling "out of control" due to unassigned tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04"></a>. Linear automated the process, solving the root cause of these frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48"></a>.

By focusing on these "emotional hooks" and deeply understanding how users feel, Linear can develop non-obvious solutions that resonate deeply, preventing the addition of features that merely scratch the surface of a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00"></a>.

## Expanding the Search Space: Extreme Version Testing

To foster creativity and avoid conventional, possibly limited, solutions, Linear employs a method of "extreme version testing" when [[building_new_products_within_larger_companies | building new features]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04"></a>.

*   **Ask "How Extreme Can You Take It?":** The process involves asking what the most outrageous or extreme version of a solution would look like along a specific trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31"></a>. This is akin to Airbnb's "11-star experience" concept, where practicality and cost are temporarily set aside to explore the full possibility space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01"></a>.
*   **Overcoming Defaults:** The goal is to break past psychological constraints and see options that might otherwise be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26"></a>. Often, the right choice isn't among the initially obvious options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56"></a>.
*   **Example: Draft Saving:** For issue drafts, Linear explored two extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03"></a>:
    1.  **Fastest Version:** No pop-ups, instant discard upon closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08"></a>. This felt "super unsafe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39"></a>.
    2.  **Safest Version:** Auto-save everything immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00"></a>. This led to "a whole bunch of untitled documents" and messy paper trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10"></a>.
*   **Finding the Balance:** By testing these extremes, they arrived at an elegant solution: prompt to save on a *brand new* issue, but auto-save for *existing* drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39"></a>. This specific choice was only obvious in hindsight, after exploring the extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09"></a>.

This iterative process of building and testing extreme versions helps Linear learn what works and what doesn't, quickly converging on optimal solutions that users love, rather than settling for mediocre or overly complex ones that contribute to bloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51"></a>.

## The Double Triangle: Go-to-Market Collaboration

Linear views product management as a "go-to-market discipline" alongside sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51"></a>. While the traditional PM-engineer-design triad is important, the collaboration between product, sales, and marketing is equally crucial for B2B success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14"></a>.

*   **Overcoming Antagonism:** Product teams often have antagonism with sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26"></a>. Linear integrates a full-time product marketer into their PM team to craft language for releases, change logs, and campaigns, ensuring it speaks the customers' native language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27"></a>.
*   **PM as a Connector:** The PM acts as a bridge, connecting the "building side" (engineering, design) with the "selling side" (sales, marketing) of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29"></a>.
*   **PMs and Messaging:** Product managers, due to their deep understanding of customer needs and requirements gathering, are uniquely positioned to "originate the message" and help marketing teams pick the right words and emphasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42"></a>. Sales then validates this messaging in the field, creating a robust feedback cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54"></a>.

This integrated approach ensures that products are not only well-built but also effectively communicated and sold, preventing bloat by aligning product development with market needs and avoiding features that don't effectively serve the business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43"></a>.

## Deadlines as a P-Zero Problem

Linear treats selected deadlines with extreme seriousness, deeming them "P-zero problems" (highest priority) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02"></a>.
*   **Commitment to the Deadline:** When a deadline is set (usually for external marketing launches), all other concerns become secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07"></a>. Engineers on such projects are not pulled for other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26"></a>.
*   **PM's Role: Cutting Scope:** The product manager's primary job is to ruthlessly cut as much scope as possible to ensure the deadline is met with a shippable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32"></a>. The goal is to reach a point where a "yes" or "no" decision can be made about shipping a functional product, even if it doesn't have all desired features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56"></a>.
*   **No Estimating:** Linear does "almost no estimating" for deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18"></a>. Instead, they focus on shipping early and fast. By having a working version within 10% of the allotted time, they set themselves up to make informed decisions about polish or further iterations, allowing for flexibility and meeting commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29"></a>.

This disciplined approach to deadlines ensures that launch opportunities are not missed and that the product remains focused on delivering core value at the committed time, rather than accumulating features that delay release.

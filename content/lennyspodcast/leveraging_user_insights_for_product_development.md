[[integrating_customer_feedback_loops_in_product_development | Incorporating user feedback into product development]] is fundamental for [[product_management_insights | product management insights]] and success, enabling teams to refine visions, build conviction, and drive adoption. Mahika Kapor, a design engineering PM hybrid at Figma, emphasizes the critical role of understanding users and integrating their perspectives throughout the product development lifecycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## The Foundation of Vision and Conviction

A compelling product vision cannot be created in a vacuum; it must be deeply connected to users and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This requires continuous engagement to truly understand user pain points and aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Cultivating Intuition Through User Engagement
Mahika stresses the [[importance_of_customer_and_user_research | importance of customer and user research]] and having "insatiable curiosity" to talk to users at every opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. This constant dialogue helps build a "repository or library of conversations" that informs product decisions and cultivates strong intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

For broader-reaching products like Figma, immersing oneself in circles where users are present, such as catching up with friends who work in tech, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.

### Gathering Insights from Users and Non-Users
It is valuable not only to ask current users about their experiences but also non-users why they *aren't* using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. These conversations can be particularly insightful, as they uncover perceptions and marketing challenges that may hinder adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.

A direct example of this approach led to the development of features for FigJam that made it easier for non-designers to get started, such as a placeholder experience that showcased various use cases beyond traditional templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

For products with a more niche audience, or in larger companies, maintaining a tight relationship with the sales team is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. Being present on sales calls allows product managers to understand customer pain points directly and ensures that these insights cross-pollinate into the product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>.

## Operationalizing User Feedback
Insights gathered from users and sales teams must be operationalized to influence product development.

### Integrating Feedback into Roadmapping and Sales Enablement
User insights directly inform the prioritization of the product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. Additionally, these insights can be used to create artifacts that help the sales team evangelize product features and upcoming developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. For instance, Mahika created a "weekend in FigJam" Loom video for the sales team to showcase various use cases, which was then distributed to inspire companies beyond brainstorming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.

For insights that are not immediately actionable, a system like a Slack integration with a task management tool (e.g., Asana) can capture feedback from sales and other internal teams into a backlog for weekly grooming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

## The Power of Continuous Feedback Loops
Figma's process includes a multi-month staging or "dogfooding" period, which is crucial for [[integrating_customer_feedback_loops_in_product_development | integrating customer feedback loops in product development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:05">[01:27:05]</a>. This willingness to be vulnerable with a product early on fosters feedback and investment from across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>.

By allowing many people within the company to use and provide feedback on early versions of a product, they become invested, feeling like they "shaped that part of the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. This cultivates a constant feedback loop and collective investment in driving success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45">[01:28:45]</a>.

## Connecting Insights to Company Goals
To come up with the "right idea," it is essential to have user empathy and to ensure that the idea ladders into a broader company goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>. Understanding the company's strategic direction, such as expanding from building for designers to covering the entire product development cycle for non-designers, helps anchor product ideas within the larger business context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>.

Ultimately, understanding user needs and connecting them to company objectives allows product managers to not just build features, but to drive innovation and create a more entrepreneurial culture within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:49">[01:29:49]</a>.

The core principle remains that [[customer_engagement_and_product_development | customer engagement and product development]] are inseparable, driving continuous improvement and strategic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

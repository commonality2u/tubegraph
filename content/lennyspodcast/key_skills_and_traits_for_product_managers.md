VR Damon, who leads all things product at Gojek, including [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product management]], design, program management, research, and insights, is recognized as one of Asia's most prominent product leaders [00:00:54]. Having worked at companies such as Directi, Airtel, MakeMyTrip, and WiZ IQ, his name frequently arises when identifying top product leaders in Asia [00:01:05].

Damon shares a [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth framework]] for product managers, known as the "Three Ws," which identifies the key areas for success and advancement [00:00:09].

## The Three Ws Framework for Product Managers

The career growth framework for product managers comprises three key areas:
1.  What you produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
2.  What you bring to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
3.  What your operating model is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>

### What You Produce
In the early stages of a product manager's career, the primary focus should be on outputs rather than solely on impact or strategy [00:07:12].

*   **Outputs:** These are tangible deliverables that can be quickly executed, such as launching a product, analyzing and running experiments, or contributing to a go-to-market strategy [00:07:35]. Examples include preparing briefs for summits, slides for leadership reviews, or legal review documents [00:13:42]. The goal is to be useful, making the team more effective and helping the company succeed by getting tasks done [00:14:18].
*   **Outcomes:** As comfort with outputs grows, product managers can begin to control which outputs are necessary, moving towards owning product areas, goals, and collaborating with stakeholders [00:08:01].
*   **Leadership and Direction:** This stage involves discerning which outcomes are crucial for strategic direction [00:08:18].

Even at senior levels, it's crucial not to forget individual contributor (IC) roots and be willing to "pull up your sleeves" to work on outputs [00:09:01]. This hands-on approach builds credibility within the team [00:09:16].

### What You Bring to the Table
This aspect focuses on a product manager's "impact on impact" [00:15:49]. It emphasizes the quality of product artifacts and the ability to demonstrate core skills.

*   **Quality of Artifacts:** This includes the quality of Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), product notes sent to care or marketing teams, North Star metrics, experiment design, data analysis, and overall metric work [00:16:12]. A high-quality, detail-oriented approach to these documents is essential [00:22:01].
*   **Demonstrating Skills:** [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | Product managers]] are evaluated on four key pillars, which should be demonstrated through artifacts:
    1.  **Data and Metrics:** From defining basic product metrics to being able to deep dive into data and lead a data startup [00:53:35].
    2.  **Design and Research:** Identifying user problems, tying them to business goals, and shaping discussions [00:54:21].
    3.  **Technology Skills:** Understanding basic technical concepts (like HTTP or API) and being able to engage in deep technical debates or write design documents [00:54:42].
    4.  **Strategy:** Defining user segments, their needs, identifying the right product for them, and the order of development, based on broader company goals [00:55:19].

Product managers should aim to channelize questions and inputs into strategic choices, rather than simply bringing arguments or pushbacks [00:23:03].

### What Your Operating Model Is
This refers to a product manager's approach to communication, collaboration, organizational skills, and community building [00:19:11]. It's especially crucial for advancing from mid-senior to senior levels [00:19:06].

Three core tenets for working effectively with others:
1.  Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with [00:19:38].
2.  Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself [00:19:48].
3.  Be in charge of getting decisions made, not making all decisions yourself [00:19:50].

It is important to keep the focus on advancing the product and its direction [00:25:04]. When pushing back, focus on bringing the conversation to a logical rather than emotional space [00:25:53]. A product manager acts as a "community enabler," tying everyone together towards a common mission, particularly in remote or distributed teams [00:52:26].

## Pitfalls Impeding Career Growth

[[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_product_management | Product managers]] often impede their own [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth]] by making specific mindset errors:

*   **Focusing on Uncontrollable Factors:** While starting a career, the focus is often on controllable aspects like feedback and personal output. However, as product managers become mid-senior, conversations can shift to external factors like organizational shortcomings or a lack of desired projects [00:28:45]. It's crucial to maintain focus on what is within one's control, such as one's output, contributions, and operating model [00:29:08].
*   **Relationship with Change:** Early in a career, the rate of change and skill acquisition is high, leading to rapid growth [00:30:05]. As one becomes mid-senior, there's a risk of becoming resistant to new challenges or hesitant to take on different product areas [00:30:28]. To counter this, continually benchmark skills against industry best practices and other functions to identify areas for improvement and maintain a high rate of change [00:30:56].
*   **Self-Perception:** The stories product managers tell themselves about their attributes (e.g., "high agency," "hyper-collaborative") can hinder growth [00:32:02]. These self-definitions can lead to anti-signaling behavior, where perceived strengths excuse weaknesses (e.g., "I'm high agency, so it's okay if I'm a little brash") [00:32:36]. Correcting these internal narratives is essential for continued growth [00:33:10]. Seeing oneself as a continuous learner is an enabling story [00:35:51].

## Addressing Role Ambiguity

The [[the_role_of_product_managers | product manager role]] is often ambiguous across the technology industry and even within large companies [00:46:56]. The general guideline for product managers is to address anything that is blocking the product's progress [00:48:06]. Product management is an art and a science, where the "science" (frameworks, defined skills) can help master the "art" (intuition, adaptability) [00:49:09].

Product managers are unique in their role as co-collaborators across various disciplines: strategy, technology, design, and data [00:49:47]. They are the only discipline that pairs with everyone, providing a unique holistic insight [00:50:06]. The role of a product manager is to elevate the team's overall contribution, energy, and output [00:50:30]. It's important to view oneself as playing a role rather than being defined solely by a title or function [01:05:20].

When seeking to improve, focus on one or two specific areas for growth at a time rather than trying to improve everything simultaneously [00:39:03]. For example, if transitioning into product management, focus on either data/tech or design/research skills based on existing background [00:41:09]. Soft skills like communication and collaboration require lifelong development [00:40:38].

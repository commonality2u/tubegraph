Claire Vo, a seasoned Chief Product Officer (CPO) at companies like Color, Optimizely, and LaunchDarkly, and creator of the popular [[tools_and_techniques_for_ai_product_managers | AI PM specific tool]] Chat PRD, shares her insights on the evolving landscape of [[ai_in_product_management | AI in product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. She emphasizes that while AI won't eliminate Product Managers (PMs) next year, the required skills are set to shift rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.

## Chat PRD: An AI Product Co-Pilot

Chat PRD, suspected to be the most used PM-specific [[ai_in_product_management | AI product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>, emerged from a real-world need to quickly spec out a complicated technical product when platform PMs were resource-constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Claire initially crafted it as a detailed prompt for ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, then evolved it into a custom GPT, and now it exists as a standalone application utilizing OpenAI's assistance APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

The standalone app offers custom assistants that learn from a user's specific content, role, and company, providing a more personalized experience than the GPT version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

### Common Use Cases for Chat PRD

*   **Generating PRDs**: Approximately 60% of users input an idea and receive a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD), including objectives, user goals, user stories, out-of-scope items, UX walk-throughs, product narratives, sequencing, milestones, measurements, and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. Users can customize the PRD template to fit their company's specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>.
*   **Improving Documentation**: About 30% of users leverage it to enhance existing specs, PRDs, strategy documents, or roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>.
*   **Brainstorming & Internal Work**: The remaining users utilize it for brainstorming ideas or generating internal PM work, such as meeting agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>.

Claire states that Chat PRD has saved PMs "dozens of hours" in writing documents, enabling individual PMs to achieve higher leverage across engineering or building teams and spend their time more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.

## [[the_impact_of_generative_ai_on_product_management | The Impact of Generative AI on Product Management]]

Claire believes that [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] will lead to significant, rapid changes in companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. The ratios between PMs and other teams are likely to shift over time, and the skills required for PMs will undoubtedly change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>.

### Skills to be Replaced vs. Enhanced

*   **Replaced/Augmented**:
    *   **Lowercase 'c' communication**: This refers to the functional trading of information that allows others to do their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. [[ai_in_product_management | Language models]] are highly capable of synthesizing information, structuring communication, and coordinating its distribution across various content modalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.
    *   **Basic Strategy Work**: AI excels at synthesizing vast amounts of information (e.g., market data, competitor analysis, internal advantages) into coherent plans to win in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>. Claire describes these tools as "exceptional" at synthesizing, distilling into a plan, and communicating that plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

*   **Harder to Replace/Core Human Skills**:
    *   **Capital 'C' communication**: This involves influence, convincing, boldness, and the ability to rally a system of humans to follow a path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>.
    *   **Boldness and Vision**: Seeing the future in a way that models trained on prior data cannot, and attracting people through charisma to make things happen, remain distinctly human strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.
    *   **Gaining Buy-in and Alignment**: The human element of getting a team, stakeholders, and leadership aligned and bought into a vision or roadmap is something AI cannot yet replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>.

Claire predicts an "identity shift" for PMs, moving away from deriving value from individually manifesting ideas to focusing on whether the right things are being built quickly and delivering value, regardless of the tool chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:59">[01:06:59]</a>.

## [[tips_for_using_ai_in_product_development | Staying Ahead with AI]]

To navigate [[the_future_of_ai_in_product_management | the future of AI in product management]], Claire offers several [[tips_for_using_ai_in_product_development | tips for using AI in product development]]:

*   **Lead in Understanding Disruption**: As a technology leader, it's crucial to understand what [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] can disrupt and how to leverage these tools to build better teams and adapt the organization's size and shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>.
*   **Focus on Building Product Skills around Non-Deterministic Products**: [[ai_in_product_management | AI tools]] introduce a new type of product. Learning how to build with these underlying, rapidly moving technologies is key, similar to how PMs specialized in mobile when it emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>.
*   **Conduct Outside-In Product Teardowns**: Analyze existing [[ai_in_product_management | AI products]] by asking: What's good/bad about this? How would I have written the PRD? What would I measure? How would I assess its quality? This helps stress-test and identify skill gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>.
*   **Experiment with No-Code/Low-Code Tools**: Even without deep engineering skills, PMs can stitch together solutions and explore [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] capabilities using no-code platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>.
*   **Find the Fun**: Engage with [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] through creative tools like Midjourney to make learning enjoyable, even if it's not directly work-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Prompt Engineering**: The quality of AI output is highly dependent on the instructions and context provided. Investing time in crafting effective prompts and comparing outputs across different tools is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>.

Claire believes that leaders must be Forward Thinking and experiment to stay ahead of potential dramatic changes in the industry, rather than ignoring them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. While some roles might be reduced, new interesting jobs may also emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

[[prototyping_and_experimenting_with_ai | Prototyping and building]] are considered fundamental to product development, with the assertion that if you're not engaged in these activities to define your vision, you're approaching it incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The importance of [[prototyping_and_experimenting_with_ai | prototyping]] has been emphasized as the "prompt sets" are becoming the new Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. This shift means that for new projects and features, prototypes and prompt sets are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

## Impact of AI on Prototyping
The integration of AI significantly changes the dynamics of [[the_role_and_evolution_of_ai_models_in_product_development | product development]]:

*   **Faster Iteration** AI tools enable a much shorter "time to first demo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. The iterative loop of [[prototyping_and_experimenting_with_ai | prototyping]], iterating, and even conducting user research through AI conversations, is significantly shortened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   **Increased Idea Supply** There is a massive increase in the supply of ideas and prototypes because of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. While this raises the floor for product quality, it also elevates the ceiling, demanding products that stand out from the noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
*   **Blurred Lines in Roles** At the [[prototyping_and_experimenting_with_ai | prototyping]] and early idea discovery stages, the lines between roles become blurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. While a few "tastemakers" remain crucial for editorial direction to avoid "Frankenstein products," AI allows more people to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.
*   **Importance of Taste-Making** In a world with an overwhelming supply of ideas and prototypes, the "taste-making" and editing functions become extremely important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. This raises the bar for product professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

## Operationalizing AI Prototyping
At Microsoft, there is a strong cultural momentum to prioritize live demos and prototypes for communicating ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. While not always feasible for deep product changes, it is essential for new products and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

A personal practice to encourage [[using_ai_tools_for_product_management_and_development | AI integration]] is a Chrome extension that prompts: "How can you use AI to do what you're going to do right now?" This tool was built using GitHub Copilot in about 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>. This highlights the ease of [[building_web_products_with_ai_tools | building web products with AI tools]].

## Preparing for the Future
Product builders should prepare for a future where [[prototyping_and_experimenting_with_ai | prototyping]] is core, and "demos before memos" is the mantra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. It's crucial to understand that the initial time to demo is shorter, but the time to full deployment may be longer due to higher standards for scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

There is a call to resist the temptation to "chase after every idea" due to the increased volume of prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

A key challenge is the difficulty in updating one's "priors" about what AI models can do, as their capabilities evolve rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. For product builders, there is an "arbitrage" opportunity to benefit from cutting against the grain, ignoring past limitations, and setting high expectations for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.

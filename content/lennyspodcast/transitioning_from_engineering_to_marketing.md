Ros Herberg, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) and VP of Product Strategy at Whiz, has an unconventional career path, moving from engineering to product management and then into marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. Her journey provides unique insights into the distinct roles of product and marketing within a rapidly scaling company.

## Why the Shift to Marketing?

Ros's transition to marketing at Whiz was not a pre-planned career move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. It occurred when Whiz was about two and a half years old, after achieving significant product-market fit and establishing a functioning sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. At this stage, marketing emerged as a "major block" for the company's continued growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

Key reasons for her move included:
*   **Awareness Challenge** Despite winning proofs of value (POVs) against competitors, Whiz was often signing deals with customers who had not previously heard of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. There was a clear need to increase awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.
*   **CEO's Request** The CEO, Assaf, directly asked Ros to take on the marketing leadership role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. Ros emphasized her philosophy of following good people and doing what they ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Belief in Brand Importance** Ros was convinced that as a company scales, brand becomes critically important, much like how consumers choose an iPhone over an Android without deep technical comparisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.
*   **Following the "Heat"** Ros perceived that the "heat" or most pressing challenge in the organization had shifted from product development and sales to marketing, indicating where the most impact could be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.

## Navigating the Transition: A Steep Learning Curve

Coming from an engineering and product background, Ros had no prior experience in marketing and was unfamiliar with common marketing terminology like "leads" or "pipeline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. Her initial reaction to the proposal was that it sounded "bizarre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

To quickly ramp up, she dedicated a weekend to learning about the role of a CMO in B2B companies by listening to podcasts and speaking with experienced CMOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

### Key Learnings and Contrasting Mindsets

Ros's transition provided her with a unique perspective on the differences between product and marketing:

*   **Product Development vs. Marketing Campaigns:**
    *   **Product:** "Less is more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. Adding features requires significant engineering time and can complicate the product permanently; mistakes have a "huge cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.
    *   **Marketing:** "Quite the opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. There's "no cost to anything," no technical debt, and no maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>. If a campaign fails, "nothing happened," and a new approach can be tried immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. This encourages experimentation and a willingness to "try everything" to make noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.

*   **Importance of [[role_of_marketing_in_product_success|Marketing in Product Success]]:** From her new marketing lens, Ros realized the "criticality of marketing and even of product marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. She understood the gap between those deeply embedded in the technical product domain and the broader market or sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. Marketing acts as a "multiplier" that bridges this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>.

### Embracing Failure and Driving Impact

A core aspect of Ros's approach is her comfort with failure, a quality she attributes partly to her upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. She believes it's empowering to give oneself "the opportunity to fail" and still attempt new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. This mindset allows her to take risks and experiment, which is crucial in marketing where rapid iteration is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.

An example of this risk-taking was Whiz's "Whiz of Oz" booth at the RSA security conference. Instead of a traditional "red and black" cyber security booth, they opted for a bizarre, optimistic "pink and bright blue" theme with actors, aiming solely to "make noise" and stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>. Despite her fear of it being a "terrible bizarre" failure, it resulted in five times more visitors than the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. This unconventional approach has even inspired other cyber companies to adopt themed booths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.

### The "Dummy Explanation" and Crystal Clear Messaging

Ros emphasizes the importance of the "dummy explanation" â€“ ensuring that all marketing messages are easily understandable by anyone, regardless of their knowledge of Whiz, its products, or the deep technical domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

Product teams, living "inside their own bubbles," often use complex terminology or industry-specific initials (e.g., CSPM for Cloud Security Posture Management, CNAPP for Cloud Native Application Protection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. However, customers might search for "Cloud security solution," not technical jargon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. Ros constantly reminds her team that their audience doesn't live in the "Whiz bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.

She highlights that while product teams can sometimes "work with things that are like fluffy or blurry or like gray" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>, marketing needs "crystal clear, black and white" communication to scale its message effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. Fuzzy signals from product can lead to messages being "lost in translation" in the go-to-market process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.

## Advice for Product Leaders

Ros's experience underscores that product leaders should prioritize delivering "Crystal Clear messages about the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. Understanding the "go-to market perspective" and the "user perspective and the seller perspective" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, as what seems simple internally can become complex when communicated externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

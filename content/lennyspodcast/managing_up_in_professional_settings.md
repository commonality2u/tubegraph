Managing up is a crucial skill that involves effectively communicating and working with your manager to achieve mutual goals and support overall organizational success. This skill is often underestimated, but it becomes even more vital as one advances in their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>.

## The Importance of Managing Up
Many mistakenly believe that managing up is only necessary for junior roles and that it can be outgrown with seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. However, this is a myth; managing up becomes *more* important as you become more senior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>. As you take on higher-level roles, you deal with increased ambiguity and broad mandates (e.g., "make this number go up" or "create this division") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. In such scenarios, it is essential to proactively keep your manager in the loop and ensure alignment on your initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.

Investing in learning to manage up effectively serves you throughout your entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>. Senior leaders are often adept at managing up, which contributes to their career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

## Key Strategies for Managing Up

### 1. Share Your Point of View (POV)
The most impactful way to manage up is by being vocal about sharing your point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>. Instead of asking "what should we do?", offer your manager a proposed solution, asking: "Here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps? Am I thinking in the right direction?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.
*   **Reduce Cognitive Load:** This approach significantly reduces the mental effort required from your manager, as they have something concrete to react to rather than starting from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>.
*   **Demonstrate Strategic Thinking:** It shows that you are an active, rigorous thinker who is strategically engaged with the business, rather than just waiting to be told what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.
*   **Early Career Acceleration:** This approach is a powerful way for even junior team members to demonstrate [[advice_for_career_advancement_at_senior_management_levels | leadership potential]] and accelerate their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>.
*   **Crystallize Your Own Thinking:** Articulating a recommendation forces you to think deeply about the problem, which helps to crystallize your own understanding and perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.

### 2. Connect Your Ideas to Company Goals
When pitching an idea, always connect it to the company's overarching goals or priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. Leaders prioritize initiatives that directly support the company's most important objectives, such as retention or revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. Framing your proposal within this context increases the likelihood of it being prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.

### 3. Maintain the Right Level of Confidence
Strike a balance between being overconfident and underconfident:
*   **Speak Accurately:** State hypotheses as hypotheses, not facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. Be precise about your level of conviction and the evidence you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>. If it's an initial hunch, say so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. This avoids misleading your team into investing resources based on overstated claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
*   **Avoid Diminishing Your Points:** If you have strong reasons for a recommendation, don't diminish your point by saying "you can ignore everything I just said" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. It's irresponsible to act unsure if you're confident in your reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.
*   **Back with Evidence:** Support your recommendations with evidence, logic, first principles, examples, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. This provides a basis for discussion and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.
*   **Avoid "Single-Minded Martyr" Mindset:** Do not become overly fixated on your own agenda. If your proposal isn't prioritized, understand the broader organizational context and current company goals. A mature perspective involves understanding that the best decision for the company might not always align with your immediate win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.

### 4. Anticipate Objections (MOO Framework)
Employ the "Most Obvious Objection" (MOO) framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. Before sharing information, especially in meetings, take a moment to consider what obvious objections or questions might arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.
*   **Prepare Your Counterarguments:** By anticipating objections, you can proactively address them in your communication or strengthen your pitch before presenting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>.
*   **Don't Be Blindsided:** This preparation reduces the likelihood of feeling surprised or caught off guard by questions, allowing you to maintain composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
*   **Empathize with Your Audience:** MOO is a tactical way to practice empathy, considering your audience's potential concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.

### 5. Address the "Question Behind the Question"
When a manager asks a question, especially if it's repeated or multiple questions surface around the same topic, there might be a deeper underlying concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.
*   **Probe for Understanding:** Instead of just saying "I'll get back to you," try to answer a related question and then ask about the intent behind their query (e.g., "Are you wondering if we are investing in mobile appropriately?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>.
*   **Reflect Back:** If unsure, reflect back their question to confirm understanding: "Let me just make sure I understand what you're thinking, what you're looking for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This buys time and ensures clarity.

### 6. Prioritize Upfront Investment in Communication
Almost all communication strategies benefit from spending "a little bit more upfront investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.
*   **Save Time Downstream:** Investing a few extra minutes to make a message clearer or a document more concise can save hours of back-and-forth questions and clarify what's needed, preventing communication breakdowns that affect multiple people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>. This is particularly true for written communication, where a "poorly written memo's blast radius is way bigger than most people think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.
*   **Compound Effect:** While individual instances may seem minor, these small improvements compound over time, significantly increasing the quality and effectiveness of your work output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

## General Communication Principles that Aid Managing Up
*   **Take Agency:** If you're not getting the desired reaction, ask yourself how you might be contributing to the confusion, skepticism, or apathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Focus on how you can explain things more clearly, be more compelling, and anticipate questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Practice Like It's Game Day:** Treat every stakeholder as important, not just executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This provides more opportunities to practice effective communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Conciseness:** Focus on the economy of words and density of insight, not just brevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Know your core point before communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Preparation is key to being concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>.
*   **"Sales Then Logistics":** Always start by selling the "why" â€” why a task or initiative matters, why it's important to the company, and why now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. Only after buy-in should you delve into the logistics and details of how to do something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>. This brief "selling" can take as little as a few sentences to a minute or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.
*   **Signposting:** Use specific words (e.g., "for example," "because," "as a next step," "first/second/third") and thoughtful formatting to guide your reader and signal what's coming next in your communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. However, avoid excessive formatting like bolding too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
*   **Focus on Behavior Change, Not Self-Expression:** When giving feedback, the goal is to motivate behavior change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. Trim anything that doesn't contribute to that goal, focusing only on the part that will make the person want to change and understand the benefit to themselves and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.

By applying these principles, individuals can significantly improve their ability to manage up, leading to better outcomes and accelerated career growth.

NuBank, a massive fintech company, attributes 80-90% of its growth to word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This achievement stems from an intense focus on building products that customers "love fanatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Building Fanatical Products

[[building_customer_loyalty_and_internal_champions | Building customer loyalty and internal champions]] is a core tenet for NuBank, driven by the desire for customers to not just like, but deeply love their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Tapping into Deep Pain Points
NuBank started by addressing a "deep pain point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Large incumbent Brazilian banks were among the most profitable globally but also "amongst the most hated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This widespread customer dissatisfaction created a fertile ground for NuBank's disruptive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### A Culture of Fanaticism
NuBank's founders intentionally instilled a strong company culture where values are "alive in our employees' minds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The first of their five core values is: "We want our customers to love us fanatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This value isn't just a sign on the wall; it biases decisions "in favor of the customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, ensuring that products are built to encourage word-of-mouth sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

NuBank's five core values are:
1.  We want our customers to love us fanatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
2.  We are hungry and we challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
3.  We build strong and diverse teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
4.  We pursue smart efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
5.  We think and act like owners, not renters, doing what's right even when not told to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Operationalizing Customer Love
To [[operationalizing_the_principle_of_meticulousness_in_product_development | operationalize the principle of meticulousness in product development]] and customer love, NuBank employs several techniques:
*   **Amazon Mock Press Release**: Before allocating engineering resources, teams must articulate "why the intended customer should care" in a two-paragraph press release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>.
*   **Product and Design Reviews**: Regular reviews ask, "Why is this great for the customer? Why is this fundamentally different?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>. The goal is to redefine categories on dimensions of quality, complexity, and price simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>. The mantra is "good enough isn't good enough; is it great enough?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:49">[02:08:49]</a>.

### Measuring Customer Fanaticism
NuBank is "maniacal" about measuring whether customers love their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.
*   **Sean Ellis Score**: NuBank heavily relies on the Sean Ellis score to measure [[product_management_and_innovation | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. They "rarely scale a project" until the Sean Ellis score hits a "really compelling" threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>. The methodology asks customers how disappointed they would be if a product went away, with "very disappointed" being the key metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>. While Sean Ellis suggests 40%, NuBank adjusts for cultural biases (e.g., Brazilians being more polite) and aims for 50% "very disappointed" customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.
*   **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: NuBank tracks NPS "maniacal[ly]" as a company and for individual products, aiming for "world-beating" scores often in the 70s-90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. A dip of even one or two points triggers alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>.
*   **Churn**: Low churn is critical, as it indicates effective retention and fuels the word-of-mouth growth loop, reducing the need for extensive marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.

### Iterating Based on Feedback
NuBank leverages these metrics to iterate and improve products. For their payments assistant product, *Assisten Gagos*, initial Sean Ellis scores were decent, but a small cohort of users with complex billing needs (more than four commitments across at least two payment rails) showed a 70% "very disappointed" score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:12">[02:32:12]</a>. This pinpointed the "Bullseye cohort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>, leading to systematic iterations to simplify onboarding multiple bills across different rails, transforming the experience from incrementally better to fundamentally different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:53">[02:39:53]</a>. This focus led to over 10 million monthly active users, up from hundreds of thousands 15 months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:57">[02:49:57]</a>.

### [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development | Talking to customers for product development]]
For [[customercentric_product_development | customercentric product development]], NuBank encourages direct engagement:
*   **Call 10 Customers**: Instead of lengthy surveys, product managers are encouraged to "pick up the phone yourself" and call 10 customers directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:48">[02:29:48]</a>. This direct feedback provides nuanced insights (like tone of voice) that statistics miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a>.
*   **Focus on Problems, Not Solutions**: When interviewing, the goal is to observe more than ask direct questions, and to "search for the problem more than the solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:08">[02:37:08]</a>.
*   **Strong Hypothesis**: Before customer research, teams should have a "very very clearly" articulated hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:06">[02:36:06]</a>. This ensures that data gathered either validates or invalidates a specific point of view, preventing aimless research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:17">[02:36:17]</a>. Product managers are encouraged to "have a point of view on what you think the customer will say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:07">[02:38:07]</a>.
*   **Devil's Advocate**: During customer interactions, product teams should almost "try to sell against your idea," making the customer sell them on the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:41">[02:41:41]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Product Development

[[product_management_and_innovation | Product management and innovation]] at NuBank places a high value on clear strategy.

### Clarity in Strategy
NuBank believes that "great execution multiplied by a poor strategy is a waste of everyone's time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. A clear strategy, even if not entirely correct, allows for easier course correction because there's a defined expectation of what should be happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. As Kevin Systrom of Instagram famously said, "We may not be right, but at least we are clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

### Strategy vs. Aspiration
NuBank emphasizes that strategy is not an ambitious goal, aspiration, or financial outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. Instead, drawing from Richard Rumelt's work, strategy is defined as "a coherent plan for how you're going to apply your strengths in a leveraged way against a core important problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>.

For NuBank in 2014, their strategy was specific: target "Millennial, middle-class, urban Brazilians" who hated credit card fees and couldn't get credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>. Their solution was a no-fee credit card, made possible by being branchless and digital, which disrupted the market emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. This clear, specific strategy informs the "minimal set of activities" needed for traction and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>.

### Concentrated Bets
For startups, [[product_management_misconceptions | diversification]] preserves wealth, but "concentration is what builds wealth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>. Startups need to make "concentrated bets" rather than hedging, and these high-stakes bets require extreme clarity on why they're expected to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

### "Fundamentally Different" vs. "Incrementally Better"
NuBank's motto, even printed on coffee mugs, is "We're not trying to be incrementally better, we are trying to be fundamentally different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>. This philosophy is core to [[product_management_and_innovation | product management and innovation]] because only fundamentally different products compel customers to tell their friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>. While not every feature can be fundamentally different, the goal is to find "anchors" that redefine the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>.

## Category Design

NuBank is firmly in the camp of "new category business" or [[product_management_and_innovation | category design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>. They were among the first to intentionally build a "branchless bank" in Brazil based on the rise of smartphones, offering a "bank branch in your pocket" with a digital cost structure that allowed disruptive pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>. Their decision to launch with credit first, rather than a bank account (a riskier but more impactful choice), was a concentrated bet defining this new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. Even when entering existing markets, like secured lending (*consignado*), NuBank aimed to reinvent the category by making it digital and direct-to-consumer, undercutting traditional middlemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>.

## Expanding Product Lines

NuBank is considered one of the most successful companies historically at launching new business lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>, growing from a Brazilian credit card company to a "full-solution Latin American bank" with a dozen to 20 core product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.

Their strategy for expanding product lines is not a "predestined master plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a> but rather a process of "robust debate and real candor" among smart people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. A critical principle is "we don't scale big problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>. Products are rigorously tested and iterated on to achieve [[product_management_and_innovation | product market fit]] (e.g., the 50% Sean Ellis score) *before* aggressive scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>. For example, their *Ultravioleta* credit card underwent two to two and a half years of lab work to find its product-market fit before scaling aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>.

[[ceo_involvement_in_product_development | CEO involvement in product development]] and other senior leaders support this by fostering a culture where [[product_management_misconceptions | product managers]] are expected to act as "owners, not renters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>, bringing "bad news" early and advocating for what's right, even if it means delaying scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

## Future Vision: AI-Native Banking

NuBank's future vision for fintech, particularly in Latin America and globally, rests on several "unproven hypotheses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>:
*   **Holistic Banking**: Providing a full solution across all financial "seasons" of someone's life: spending, saving, investing, borrowing, and protecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.
*   **Global Bank on a Single Codebase**: Leveraging technology to build a global bank with a single, unified codebase, unlike many traditional banks built through acquisitions on disparate systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. This provides significant leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>.
*   **Social and Self-Driving Automation**: Building "social mechanics" into financial lives beyond general social media, and enabling "self-driving automation" for financial tasks like bill payments and savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. The goal is to make managing financial life "exponentially easier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>.
*   **AI-Native Products**: Moving beyond appending AI to existing products to building "AI native products" from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>. The metaphor is a "personal banker" for everyone, regardless of income, providing smart, automated financial advice and management previously only accessible to a select few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. This vision aims to democratize access to sophisticated financial guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

NuBank believes that by harnessing these principles, the company that "reinvents banking" can emerge from cities like São Paulo, Mexico City, or Bogotá, rather than traditional financial hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

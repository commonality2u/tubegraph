Marc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, a B2B SaaS company valued at around $350 billion at the time of recording and making $35 billion a year in revenue, shares his insights on leadership, innovation, and the [[Entrepreneurial journey and startup founding | entrepreneurial journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Salesforce, 25 years after its founding, continues to grow and dominate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Visionary Mindset and Domain Names

Benioff attributes some of his early vision to owning significant domain names, such as bill.com, you.com, code.com, and appstore.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This practice stemmed from a period in 1996 after leaving Oracle, where he began buying domain names for "ideas that the names would be great companies one day and reflected where I thought things were going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. He also owned salesforce.com and einstein.com early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

One notable instance was gifting the appstore.com domain to Steve Jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This act of generosity highlights a mutual relationship with Jobs that significantly influenced Benioff's career and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The idea for an "application economy" from Jobs led Benioff to acquire and work on appstore.com, eventually launching Salesforce's AppExchange in 2005 or 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Driving Company Growth and Attention

To gain initial attention for Salesforce, Benioff employed unconventional tactics, such as hiring actors to stage a protest at a Siebel Systems conference with signs like "The End Software Is Near" and "No Software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This deliberate disruption, combined with media staging, aimed to cut through the "noisy world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

His approach to launching new products, like Agent Force, involves:
*   **Throwing everything against the wall** and seeing "what's going to stick" to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Going all-in** and focusing the entire company and customers on the new product within a window of opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Extensive experimentation**, akin to a comedian testing jokes in clubs before a special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. This includes celebrity endorsements, direct customer demos, sales training, and aggressive marketing against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
*   **Expanding distribution** by hiring more account executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Telling customer stories** to demonstrate the product's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.
*   **Motivating existing customers** to adopt new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

## Leadership Philosophy

Marc Benioff’s [[Leadership and career advice from Andrew Bosworth | leadership]] principles include:
*   **Focusing on the journey, not the stock price**: He believes the stock is distracting and "isn't the goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.
*   **Maintaining a startup mindset**: Despite its size, Benioff views Salesforce as a "startup CEO" and an "entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.
*   **[[The role of personal growth and selfawareness for founders | Cultivating a beginner's mind (Shoshin)]]**: He emphasizes clearing the mind to remain open to new possibilities, rather than relying solely on expert knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. He uses meditation and visits to Zen temples in Kyoto to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
*   **Being an "orchestra leader"**: An entrepreneur must manage all aspects of the company – product, sales, marketing, accounting, investors, employees, and stakeholders – not just one area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.
*   **Embracing continuous improvement (Kaizen)**: Benioff highlights the Japanese motto "better better better never best" as a core principle for constant evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.
*   **Welcoming the "next thing"**: Rather than fearing new technological shifts, leaders should anticipate and be excited for future innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.

## Facing Challenges and Adversity

Benioff acknowledges that the [[Entrepreneurial journey and startup founding | entrepreneurial journey]] is a "rocket roller coaster" with no linear path to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. He shared a challenging period two years prior to the recording, involving a "huge transformation" and a 10% layoff of the company workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>. This decision, though painful and drawing public criticism, was deemed necessary to "save the company" after over-hiring during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. He learned that such "massive issues" are constant in the entrepreneurial life, requiring "financial transformation" and "technology and product and innovation transformation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

## [[Lessons on company growth and innovation | Innovation]] and the Future of AI

Benioff considers AI the "defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>. Salesforce is heavily invested in AI, performing trillions of AI transactions weekly through its Einstein and Agent Force platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.

He envisions four steps in the evolution of customer interaction:
1.  **Automate customer touch points**: As Salesforce has done for Disney and other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>.
2.  **Aggregate data**: Into a data cloud, federating with other data sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
3.  **Agentic platform**: This layer resolves issues automatically, as seen with help.salesforce.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.
4.  **Robotic drone layer**: Future robots and drones feeding off the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

This vision aligns with the fundamental computer science drive towards "lower cost, easier to use and more automated" technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

Regarding the impact of AI on jobs, Benioff notes a rebalancing of the workforce, with fewer support engineers due to robotic support, but more account executives and sales roles to drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. He believes many jobs will not be replaced, especially in blue-collar sectors, leading to a "Tale of Two Cities" where impact varies by location and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. He desires competition in the agent space, as it validates the market and pushes for continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.

Ultimately, Benioff wants to "get to the Future first and welcome our customers there," aiming to be at the forefront of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

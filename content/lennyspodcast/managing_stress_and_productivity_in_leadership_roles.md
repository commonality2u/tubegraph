Product leaders often find themselves overwhelmed and stressed, even when performing well. This stress can manifest physically, leading to various pains and aches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Shas Doshi, in a live podcast recording, shared three key questions he wished he had asked himself sooner to navigate these challenges, along with a bonus question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Why Am I So Busy?
For many product leaders, a significant source of stress and dissatisfaction is persistent busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. While common productivity techniques like maintaining to-do lists, utilizing frameworks (such as the LNO framework), or working out of a calendar are helpful, they eventually meet an "immovable force": scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. As leaders grow, their scope expands, reaching a point where no amount of efficiency or prioritization can prevent overwhelming busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### The Illusion of Annual Planning
A common example of this overwhelming scope is annual planning, which can consume two to three months for high-level managers, involving numerous spreadsheets, meetings, and stakeholder interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This process often leads to guilt, as leaders are pulled away from supporting their teams and making core product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Despite the extensive effort, the resulting plans are often forgotten or revised within weeks due to unexpected customer escalations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The popular mantra "plans are useless but planning is everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a> often leads to busywork rather than effective strategy.

### The Power of a Real Strategy
The solution to excessive planning is to establish a truly aligned and compelling product strategy. Doshi found that with a clear, pre-aligned product strategy, planning for a major product at Stripe took only three days, compared to the four to six weeks many peers spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. A robust strategy simplifies prioritization, reduces planning overhead, and provides a rigorous framework for handling unexpected escalations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. This also means letting go of the need for false precision in resource allocation (e.g., arguing over 8 versus 9 engineers for a team) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

### The Cost of Poor Decisions
Another reason for constant busyness is making suboptimal product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Leaders may quickly greenlight features, believing them to be "two-way doors" (reversible decisions), often influenced by catchy metaphors or authority bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. In reality, for most PM leaders, these are "one-way doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

Committing to features without thoroughly considering customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution leads to accumulation of "feature debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. This results in features that don't gain adoption, leading to awkward QBRs where leaders resort to "favorable anecdotes" instead of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. Subsequently, they are pressured to add more bells and whistles to meet "table stakes," signing up for even more work on features that perhaps should not have been built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

The tactical tip is to pause and engage in [[Enhancing personal productivity and work efficiency | more thinking]]—for minutes, days, or even weeks—before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Thinking is cheap; bad decisions are expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

## Do I Actually Have Good Taste?
"Taste" for product leaders extends beyond aesthetics or user experience; it encompasses the quality of the beliefs they choose to hold, which dictate how they manage, lead, and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. Early in his career at Google, Doshi adopted the belief that "we don't do strategy here; strategy is for MBAs," and "execution is everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This belief was reinforced by Google's success at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

However, at Twitter post-IPO (circa 2014), Doshi realized that despite its assets, the company was struggling because of a fundamental "product strategy problem" – the absence of a real, compelling, cohesive strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. This experience, further solidified at Stripe, revealed the folly of his earlier beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

True taste involves the ability to identify what is genuinely good *before* its results are apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. It's easy to recognize success (e.g., Nvidia's CEO in 2024, Patrick Mahomes as a great quarterback), but real taste identifies potential early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. Leaders should avoid becoming "stuff graders" who dismiss everything, as this requires zero taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.

Developing better taste requires shedding patterns based on social proof, authority bias (e.g., Bezos's "two-way door" vs. "reversible decisions"), and attraction to "catchy metaphors" or "alliterations" (e.g., "fail fast" vs. "fail quickly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. It also means not being overly impressed by complicated charts or math that one doesn't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. By evaluating ideas separate from these influences, leaders can become more critical thinkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>.

## Why Does My Job Feel So Frustrating?
Despite loving the "macro" of their product leadership roles, daily frustrations can arise because product leaders' jobs are inherently lonely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. Frustration often stems from working in misalignment with one's "superpowers" and true core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

Product work operates on three levels:
1.  **Impact:** Focusing on delivering meaningful outcomes.
2.  **Execution:** Focusing on the practical implementation of features and projects.
3.  **Optics:** Focusing on perception, reporting, and managing external views.

Doshi's epiphany was realizing that if he spent most of his time operating at a level that wasn't his "happy place" or "non-default level" (for him, "impact" was preferred, but senior roles often demand more "optics"), it led to deep frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.

The solution involves abandoning the traditional corporate path of continuous upward progression if it leads to consistent misalignment. Doshi chose to return to managing earlier-stage products at Stripe to focus more on impact rather than expanding to larger teams (50+ people) that would demand more time on optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. The advice is to identify one's superpowers and operate in accordance with them, making career decisions based on authenticity rather than external expectations or "LinkedIn envy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>. This alignment leads to better work, enjoyment, and less frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

## Am I Really Listening? (Bonus Question)
Doshi's final question, and perhaps the hardest to answer honestly, is "Am I really listening?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. Beyond active listening techniques like recapping and making eye contact, there's another, deeper level of listening crucial for world-class leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. For resources on this deeper form of listening, Doshi recommends exploring the insights of Rick Rubin, Dee Hock, and Peter Drucker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

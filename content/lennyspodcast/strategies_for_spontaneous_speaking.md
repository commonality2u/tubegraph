Spontaneous speaking constitutes the vast majority of daily communication, unlike planned presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. It includes interactions like giving feedback, toasts, Q&A sessions, and engaging in small talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Improving this skill can significantly enhance one's career, aiding in interviews, meetings, pitching ideas, and leading teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The good news is that everyone can improve their spontaneous speaking abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.

## Foundational Principles

### Prepare to be Spontaneous
It may seem counterintuitive, but effective spontaneous speaking requires preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. Athletes and jazz musicians prepare extensively to respond spontaneously to situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

### Mindset and Approach
Improving spontaneous speaking involves addressing both your mindset and your approach to communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.

## Strategies to Manage Anxiety for Spontaneous Speaking

[[techniques_to_manage_public_speaking_anxiety | Techniques to manage public speaking anxiety]] are crucial for effective spontaneous communication.

*   **Visualization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>
    *   This technique desensitizes individuals by allowing them to mentally rehearse the speaking event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   Visualize the entire process: getting on stage, delivering the presentation, receiving positive reception, and stepping off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   Incorporate deep breathing to calm yourself during visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   See the physical environment and envision the audience responding positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
    *   The goal is to make the experience feel familiar, reducing its novelty and increasing a sense of agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

*   **Dare to Be Dull** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
    *   This concept, derived from improvisation, encourages presence and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
    *   Instead of striving for perfection, focus on connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
    *   By simply answering the question, giving feedback, or engaging in small talk, you reduce self-evaluation and free up cognitive resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
    *   This permission to "just be present" often leads to better and more insightful communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

*   **Cognitive Reframing (e.g., "I'm Excited")** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>
    *   Physical symptoms of anxiety (e.g., fast heart rate, shakiness) are similar to those of excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
    *   By labeling these symptoms as excitement ("This is exciting; I get to share my point of view"), you shift your perception from negative to positive, leading to relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

*   **Use a Mantra** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>
    *   Counter negative internal self-talk (e.g., "I'm not prepared," "I'm an impostor") with a positive mantra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
    *   Examples include "I have value to add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, "You've got this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, or "Last time this went well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
    *   Writing it down or setting a reminder can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

*   **Breathing Techniques** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>
    *   Deep belly breathing slows heart rate, normalizes voice, and reduces shakiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.
    *   The **double exhale** technique involves inhaling until full, taking a little extra air, and then exhaling for a longer duration (ideally twice as long as the inhale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. This promotes the relaxation response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

*   **Get Present-Oriented** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>
    *   Anxiety often stems from fear of future negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
    *   **Tongue Twisters:** Saying tongue twisters aloud can help you focus on the present moment and warm up your voice, which nervous speakers often neglect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
        *   Example: "I slit a sheet, I slit a sheet, a sheet I slit. And on that slitted sheet I sit." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>

*   **Distract the Audience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>
    *   If you're nervous at the beginning of a talk, divert attention from yourself briefly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.
    *   You can ask a question, tell a story, show a video, or ask them to read something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
    *   This transitions you from a presenter to a facilitator, making you feel more comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>.
    *   Most people are most nervous just before and during the first minute of speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

## Structuring Spontaneous Responses
Spontaneous speaking benefits greatly from having a structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. Without it, people tend to "spew out information" or list items, which is not how brains are wired to process information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. Structures provide a logical beginning, middle, and end, making communication more digestible and memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>.

### Key Structures:

*   **Problem-Solution-Benefit**: Common in advertising, this structure identifies a problem, offers a solution, and explains the benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.
*   **P.R.E.P.** (Point, Reason, Example, Point): Useful for making a clear argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.
    *   **P**oint: State your main idea.
    *   **R**eason: Explain why you're making this point.
    *   **E**xample: Provide a specific illustration.
    *   **P**oint: Restate your main idea to reinforce it.
*   **What, So What, Now What**: Ideal for updates, feedback, or broader presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.
    *   **What**: Describe the product, service, offering, update, or feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.
    *   **So What**: Explain why it's important and relevant to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.
    *   **Now What**: Outline the next steps or implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.
*   **A.D.D.** (Answer, Detailed Example, Describe Relevance): Best for Q&A sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.
    *   **A**nswer: Respond to the question cleanly and concisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.
    *   **D**etailed Example: Provide a specific example to support your answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>.
    *   **D**escribe Relevance: Explain the significance of your answer to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>.

### Remembering and Applying Structures
*   **Catchy Names/Mnemonics**: Structures are easier to remember with memorable names (e.g., P.R.E.P., W.H.A.T., A.D.D., Four I's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.
*   **Consistent Practice**: The only way to master these structures is through repeated use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. For example, after listening to a podcast or reading, practice summarizing it using the "What, So What, Now What" structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.
*   **Dissect Communication**: Analyze other people's communication to identify the structures they use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.

## Strategies for Specific Spontaneous Situations

### Small Talk
Many people dread small talk, but it's where significant relationships are formed and fostered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>.

*   **Be Interested, Not Interesting**: Focus on setting the other person up to be successful in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.
*   **Comparable Disclosure Levels**: Aim for a balance in the depth of personal information shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. Sharing too much too quickly or not enough when the other person has shared, can feel awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.
*   **Supporting vs. Shifting Responses**:
    *   **Supporting responses** ask follow-up questions to encourage the other person to share more (e.g., "Oh great, did you spend time in San Jose?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>.
    *   **Shifting responses** redirect the conversation to yourself (e.g., "Oh, you went to Costa Rica? I went to Hawaii.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.
    *   Good conversations have more supporting than shifting responses, but some shifting is needed to show you're willing to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.

### Giving Feedback
Feedback is an opportunity to problem-solve collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.

*   **Invite Collaboration**: Frame feedback not as bestowing an opinion, but as an invitation to work together on an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.
*   **Use Structures**:
    *   **What, So What, Now What**: (See above for details) This structure quickly frames the issue, its importance, and suggested next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.
    *   **The Four I's**: A more robust structure for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.
        *   **I**nformation: Set the context for the feedback (e.g., "This is the third time you've shown up late to the meeting.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.
        *   **I**mpact: Explain the effect on you, the giver of feedback (e.g., "I feel you're not prioritizing this meeting the same way others are.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.
        *   **I**nvitation: Ask for their perspective or for them to propose a solution (e.g., "What can we do to help make sure you show up prepared for the next meeting?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.
        *   **I**mplications: Discuss the consequences or benefits of the action (e.g., "Because if you do, we're going to finish the project on time and get a new cool project.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.

### Giving Toasts and Tributes
Toasts and tributes are frequent public speaking events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.

*   **The W.H.A.T. Acronym**: A simple structure for toasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>.
    *   **W**hy are we here: Briefly state the purpose of the gathering (e.g., celebrating a product launch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.
    *   **H**ow are you connected: Explain your relationship to the person or event being celebrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.
    *   **A**necdote: Tell a concise, relevant, and accessible story or example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. This is where the core content of the tribute is often shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>.
    *   **T**hanks/Gratitude: Express appreciation and signal closure (e.g., "Cheers!") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.
*   **Be Brief**: Audiences rarely complain about a toast being too short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   **Convey Emotion through Anecdote**: Instead of just stating an emotion, show it through a story. For example, tell a sad story instead of saying "I am so sad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

### Q&A Sessions
Approach Q&A as an opportunity to extend, expand, connect, and learn, even in challenging situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.

*   **Avoid Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Don't say "Good question" to every question; it can sound like you're buying time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.
    *   Avoid ending answers with "Does that make sense?" It can imply your answer might not be clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>. Instead, ask "Did I answer your question?" or "Do you have a follow-up question?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.
*   **Use the A.D.D. Structure**: (See above for details) This helps provide comprehensive and relevant answers to questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.

### Apologizing
Apologizing effectively involves acknowledging the transgression and taking responsibility.

*   **T.R.I.P.L.E. A. (Acknowledge, Appreciate, Amend)**: A structure for apologizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>.
    *   **A**cknowledge: State what you did specifically, focusing on the transgression, not just how it made someone feel (e.g., "I'm very sorry for interrupting what you were saying. I over-spoke.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
    *   **A**ppreciate: Express understanding or appreciation for the difficulty you caused (e.g., "I can imagine my doing that made you feel bad and you feel that you didn't get your fair share of sharing your point of view.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a>.
    *   **A**mend: State specific actions you will take to remedy the situation or prevent it from happening again (e.g., "Next time, I will work not to do this. In fact, I will wait until you're done and I will actually paraphrase what you said before I contribute my point.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>.

## General Tips for Improvement

*   **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Improving communication, whether spontaneous or planned, comes through repetition, reflection, and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   **Seek Feedback**: You are not always the best judge of your own communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.
*   **Leverage Resources**:
    *   [[public_speaking_exercises_and_games | Toastmasters]]: A wonderful organization for getting repetitions and feedback in a supportive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. They have a special focus on spontaneous speaking (Table Topics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.
    *   [[public_speaking_exercises_and_games | Improvisation]] classes: Help you get comfortable being present and collaborating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>.
    *   Continuing studies/extension classes: Many universities offer courses open to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.
    *   Podcasts, books, blogs, and videos: Provide valuable insights and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Normalize Anxiety
> It is innate to being human to feel nervous communicating in front of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>. Many accomplished speakers, including executives and podcast hosts, still experience anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Recognizing that you are not alone in feeling this way can significantly reduce self-imposed pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:55">[02:00:55]</a>. Improvement is a process, not a sudden switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:48">[02:21:48]</a>.

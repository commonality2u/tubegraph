[[providing_effective_feedback | Effective feedback]] is crucial in various settings, especially in the workplace where individuals are frequently asked to provide their thoughts on designs, roadmaps, or strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. Many people require assistance in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

## Defining Feedback

Feedback should be viewed as an opportunity for problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>. While some behaviors necessitate immediate intervention, often feedback serves to invite collaboration and mutual work on a given issue or challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. This approach aligns with the concept of [[radical_candor | Radical Candor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>.

## Key Principles for Delivering Feedback

### Prepare to Be Spontaneous
Even when giving on-the-spot feedback, preparation is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. Just as athletes practice to perform spontaneously in their sport, individuals can prepare to improve their spontaneous communication, including delivering feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.

### Strive for Connection Over Perfection
When delivering feedback, focus on connecting with the recipient rather than striving for perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. By daring to be "dull" and simply delivering the necessary feedback, you reduce self-evaluation and free up mental resources to genuinely help the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This approach often leads to more insightful and effective feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### Use Structured Approaches
Employing a structure for your feedback helps to package information for easier digestion by the recipient and aids in formulating your thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>. It reduces the burden of thinking "what to say" and "how to say it" simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

Common structures that can be adapted for feedback include:
*   **Problem-Solution-Benefit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>
*   **PREP (Point, Reason, Example, Point)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>
*   **What-So What-Now What** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>:
    *   **What:** Describe the specific observation or behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.
    *   **So What:** Explain the importance and relevance of the observation, including its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
    *   **Now What:** Suggest next steps or actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>.

    *Example*: If someone spoke too quickly during an implementation plan discussion, the feedback could be:
    *   *What:* "When you talked about the implementation plan, you spoke a little quicker than you did with the other parts and didn't go into the same level of detail." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>
    *   *So What:* "When you speak quickly without a lot of detail, people might think you're not as prepared or you're really concerned about this part." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>
    *   *Now What:* "Next time, I suggest you slow down and include these two-three bits of data so that people see you really are knowledgeable in this area." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>

### The Four I's Structure
This structure offers a more robust framework for [[providing_constructive_feedback | constructive feedback]]:
1.  **Information:** Set the context by stating the specific behavior or issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.
2.  **Impact:** Explain the impact of the behavior on you, the feedback giver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
3.  **Invitation:** Invite the recipient to collaborate on a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>.
4.  **Implications (or Consequences):** Discuss the potential benefits or negative outcomes of addressing (or not addressing) the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.

*Example*: For an employee consistently late and unprepared for meetings:
*   "This is the third time that you have showed up late to this meeting (Information). I feel you're not prioritizing this meeting the same way others of us are (Impact). What can we do to help make sure you show up prepared for the next meeting (Invitation)? Because if you do, we're going to finish the project on time and get a new cool project (Implications)." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>

### Practice and Reflection
To get better at delivering feedback, consistent practice, reflection, and seeking feedback from others are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Humans are often not the best judges of their own communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. Organizations like Toastmasters and improvisation classes can provide opportunities for practice and real-time feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

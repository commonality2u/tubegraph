Andrew "Boz" Bosworth, Meta's Chief Technology Officer (CTO), joined Facebook in early 2006 as one of its first engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Over his 18-year tenure, he has been instrumental in creating some of the internet's most impactful products, including the Facebook News Feed and the original Facebook mobile ads platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. He also contributed to the Facebook messaging system, profile, timeline, Facebook groups, and even the internal engineering boot camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. More recently, he led the company's AR/VR organization, now known as Reality Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## The Early Days of Facebook: Hardship Behind the "Romanticism"

While movies might romanticize the early days of startups, the reality at Facebook was often marked by intense struggle and sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. As the 10th engineer (or somewhere between 10th and 16th, as several joined simultaneously) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, Boz experienced periods of working 120 hours per week, with no hobbies, and minimal sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. For about two years, he had to wake up every four hours to check reports and defend the site from attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

> "It's a healthy thing for people to want to throw themselves into something and take that risk, but it is not glamorous." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>

In those nascent years, there were no experts to consult; engineers had to figure out solutions themselves, even building new servers from components bought at electronics stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Support functions like payroll, finance, IT, and HR were not professionally handled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Boz emphasizes that while his sacrifices paid off, many others who committed equally, or more, might not see the same success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

### The News Feed: A Controversial Success

One of Boz's early and most impactful projects was the Facebook News Feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. It was the first algorithmically ranked content feed on any social network and contained Facebook's very first AI code for ranking content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Initially, people strongly rejected the News Feed, feeling it shared too much information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

However, the team's conviction in their vision proved correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Despite outrage, user engagement immediately doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This taught Boz that sometimes, "you're choosing your customers as much as your customers are choosing you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. The News Feed, combined with ads, has created trillions of dollars in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

Boz believes that while listening to customers is crucial, it's also important to distinguish between minor execution errors and a fundamentally wrong product idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. He admits that in the case of the News Feed, they made "a bunch of little mistakes," but the core idea was right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

## Leadership and Management Philosophy

Boz offers several insights on [[effective_team_building_and_leadership_in_startups | effective team building and leadership]]:

### Leveraging Your Leaders: Asking for Help

Boz's most frequent advice to professionals is to "more directly leverage their leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Many people hesitate to ask for help, fearing it signals incompetence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. However, the job isn't always to do it yourself, but to "get it done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Managers want their team members to succeed, as it makes their own jobs easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

He recommends proactively sending concise updates (e.g., a "five to ten sentence email") to managers, even if everything is going well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This provides "a little heartbeat" and allows managers to intervene early if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. When blocked, employees can make it easy for their manager by drafting emails or framing specific questions for them to answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

### The Power of Refusing to Rule

As a manager, one of the most powerful things to do is "refuse to rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This means trusting your team to figure things out when they bring a problem, rather than immediately providing a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### Transparency and Information Sharing at Meta

Meta's culture is built on transparency, with open Q&As with Mark Zuckerberg and widespread internal sharing of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This approach maximizes the potential of talented employees by ensuring they have the information needed to be fully leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. It fosters a bottom-up culture where people understand the top-down mission and have the data to act on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

However, this comes at a price: individuals must become skilled at managing the overwhelming amount of incoming information, filtering out noise, and prioritizing what matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Top-Down Vision, Bottom-Up Execution

While Meta is often perceived as a "bottom-up" culture, Boz clarifies that major strategic ideas primarily come from the top, especially from Mark Zuckerberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. However, within these top-down frameworks, teams are given significant degrees of freedom to develop and execute ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Leaders provide clear guidelines, indicating areas with strict direction versus those with more flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

### When to Go Deep: The "Eye of Sauron"

Founders and executives often grapple with how deeply to get involved in specific details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Boz explains that leaders, like Mark Zuckerberg, apply "the Eye of Sauron" to the most critical things, examining every detail, from strategy to a single pixel on a UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Other less critical areas might have clearer roadmaps or industry examples where broad delegation is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

## Career Growth and Personal Development

Boz's career journey reflects a continuous pursuit of learning and impact.

### Optimizing for Learning

Boz had an unusual career arc, frequently changing roles (every six months at one point) early on to aggressively learn new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This strategy, while potentially slower for promotions initially, provided a broad range of experiences and understanding of different dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. He advises optimizing for learning in early career stages, viewing it as compounding interest that pays off significantly later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. This aligns with [[navigating_talent_and_skill_changes_in_tech | navigating talent and skill changes]] by continuously acquiring new skills.

### Embracing Passion and New Challenges

Boz discovered that he could become passionate about various domains, even those he initially resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. When Mark Zuckerberg asked him to work on ads, he was hesitant, seeing himself as an "AI infrastructure product guy." However, once he engaged, he found it fascinating and deeply engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The same happened with hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of giving new roles time (e.g., six months) to see if passion develops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Kindness in Feedback

Boz candidly shares his biggest professional regrets stem from not being kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. He distinguishes "kindness" from "niceness" (which can be patronizing or half-truths) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. True kindness involves delivering feedback productively, intending to help the other person improve rather than just making them feel bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. This is a core aspect of [[authenticity_and_leadership_in_tech | authenticity and leadership]].

### "Communication is the Job"

Boz strongly believes that "communication is the job" for anyone aspiring to have an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Ideas alone mean nothing; effective communication is what drives change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Leaders must take "extreme ownership" when communication fails, asking what they could have done differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. He also notes that "silence is communication" – meaning is always conveyed, even by absence or non-verbal cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

To communicate effectively, Boz advises:
*   **Multimodality:** Delivering messages through various channels (e.g., all-hands meeting followed by a written post) to cater to different learning styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing fears and concerns upfront:** People won't listen if they don't believe you understand the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
*   **Empathy for the audience:** Understanding their mental model and where they are starting from in a conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### Personal Growth and Professional Impact

Boz attributes his professional growth (supported by mentors like Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg) to making him a better partner and husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Conversely, his experiences with parenting literature have made him a better manager, particularly in understanding and engaging with people's emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

## Meta's Recent Turnaround: Navigating Public Perception and Investment

Meta experienced a significant downturn in public perception and stock price, followed by a dramatic rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Boz points out that Meta experienced the largest single-day stock drop in history, followed 18 months later by the largest single-day gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

### Lessons from Market Swings

Boz reiterates the wisdom that "you're never as good as they say you are when you're winning and they're never as bad as they say you are when you're losing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. He advises team members to remember that they "know more than the critics" about the company's true value, while still reading external criticism for different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

A key learning was the need to communicate more effectively with the market about Meta's long-term investments, particularly in AI and Reality Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Meta had been making these bets for over a decade, with AI breakthroughs like Llama 2 and its FAIR research lab being second only to Google in citations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. When economic conditions tightened, it became crucial to explain why maintaining a balanced portfolio of investments, rather than solely focusing on the core business, was essential for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

### Organizational Adjustments

The downturn also led to significant [[hiring_philosophies_and_organizational_structure_in_tech_startups | organizational structure]] shifts and workforce adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This was a response to the "COVID boom" in e-commerce and remote work that led to over-hiring, as growth returned to its original timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Boz acknowledged the pain of these decisions and the difficulty for a workforce unfamiliar with economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## AR/VR and the Future of Computing

As head of Reality Labs, Boz is at the forefront of Meta's AR/VR efforts.

### Meta Quest vs. Apple Vision Pro

Boz and Mark Zuckerberg personally tried the Apple Vision Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. While the Vision Pro's display resolution and pass-through tuning are excellent when stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, Boz asserts that Meta's Quest 3 offers better overall value and performance for most use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. He highlights several drawbacks of the Vision Pro:
*   **Field of view:** Very small once eye relief is factored in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **Display brightness:** Dimmer than Quest 3 displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Motion blur:** Distracting in mixed reality use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Comfort:** The Vision Pro's weight and wire are notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Hand tracking:** Quest 3's hand tracking is superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Controllers:** Quest 3's inclusion of controllers expands capabilities beyond just hand tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

He encourages people to try the Quest 3 themselves before forming an opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

### Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses

Boz is a big fan of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, using them to film his kids without a phone in their face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. He's particularly excited about the multimodal AI capabilities, allowing users to ask the Meta AI assistant questions using the camera, as he demonstrated in a ski village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. He also teased future AR glasses with full AR capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## Personal Insights and Wisdom

### Trusting Yourself

Boz's family motto is "trust yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. He believes this is crucial for navigating peer pressure, self-doubt, and making bold decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. It's about having faith in your own intellect and perspective over external narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Trusting yourself also means being willing to take risks, confident in your ability to handle the outcomes if they don't pay off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### Embracing Curiosity

Reflecting on past personal failures, especially those where his "identity was caught up in being right," Boz emphasizes the power of curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. He learned from a colleague, Ami Vora, who responded to profound disagreements with "fascinating, you have to tell me more about why you think that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This genuine curiosity tears down walls, encourages open-mindedness, and allows for genuine learning and even changing one's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Boz advises that in moments of internal "clench," one should try to embrace curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

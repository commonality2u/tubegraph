Activation and onboarding are critical components for a product's success and sustainable growth. [[principles_and_practices_for_improving_retention_and_activation_metrics | Improving retention]] is often hard, but it's "usually much more a function of onboarding to the right user experience than it is about the kind of the tactical things that people try to do to improve retention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>.

## Defining Activation and Onboarding

Activation focuses on shaping the first user experience to ensure they use the product effectively and understand its core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>. Onboarding is the process of guiding users to their "aha moment" or first valuable experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.

## The Importance of Activation and Onboarding

For early-stage products, the product team often focuses on the roadmap, while the marketing team focuses on acquisition, leading to neglect of the crucial first user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. Users are at their highest risk of churning if they don't reach a "must-have" experience quickly after signing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. If this initial experience is not optimized, companies may struggle to find "scalable profitable customer acquisition channels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

### Case Study: LogMeIn
At LogMeIn, 95% of sign-ups never performed a remote control session, the product's core function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. A complete freeze was placed on product development, and all product, engineering, design, and marketing resources focused on improving the signup-to-usage rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. Within three months, the signup-to-usage rate improved by 1,000%, going from 5% to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. This allowed the company to scale previously limited acquisition channels from $10,000 to $1 million per month, with 80% of new users coming from word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## Leveraging the [[shaun_ellis_test_for_product_market_fit | Shaun Ellis Test]]]]

The [[shaun_ellis_test_for_product_market_fit | Shaun Ellis Test]] is a leading indicator of product-market fit, gauging how users would feel if they could no longer use a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. It asks: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" with options: "very disappointed," "somewhat disappointed," or "not disappointed/not applicable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. A score of 40% or more "very disappointed" indicates a strong signal of product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

This test is useful even with an MVP, allowing for early feedback on product resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The ideal time to ask is from a random sample of "activated" users who have used the product at least twice within the last week or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

### Informing Onboarding from [[shaun_ellis_test_for_product_market_fit | Shaun Ellis Test]] Results
*   **Identify "Must-Have" Users:** Deeply understand who considers the product a "must-have," how they use it, what problems it solves, and what they used before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Case Study: Lookout:** Initially, only 7% of users would be "very disappointed" without Lookout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Analysis showed this 7% valued the antivirus functionality most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The strategy involved:
    1.  **Repositioning:** Marketing the product specifically for antivirus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
    2.  **Streamlining Onboarding:** Making antivirus setup the very first step after sign-up, immediately delivering value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
    This "set the right expectations and speed to value" approach increased the "very disappointed" score to 40% in two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Strategies for Improving Activation and Onboarding

### 1. Deeply Understand the Problem
"A problem well stated is a problem half solved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. Focus on understanding *why* users are not engaging or progressing through onboarding.
*   **Direct User Feedback:** Ask users why they signed up but didn't convert. For LogMeIn, a simple email asking "what happened?" revealed skepticism about the product being free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>. Adding a clear choice between a paid trial and a free version increased the download rate by 300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:45">[00:59:45]</a>.
*   **Qualitative & Quantitative Blend:** Combine analytics to identify drop-off points with qualitative research (surveys, interviews) to understand the *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>.

### 2. Focus on "Speed to Value"
Collapse the time it takes for a user to experience the core benefit of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. This often involves reducing friction and increasing desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.

### 3. Identify and Focus on "Must-Have" Benefits
Use follow-up surveys to the "very disappointed" users from the [[shaun_ellis_test_for_product_market_fit | Shaun Ellis Test]]:
1.  **Open-ended:** Ask "What is the primary benefit that you get?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>.
2.  **Multiple-choice:** Use collected open-ended responses to create distinct benefit statements. Ask a new group of "very disappointed" users to choose one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.
3.  **Contextual "Why":** Ask "Why is that benefit important to you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>. This reveals the deeper user context (e.g., "drowning in email" for Zne) that can inform messaging and acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>.

### 4. Strategic Approach to "Somewhat Disappointed" Users
While typically advised to focus on "must-have" users to avoid diluting the product, Superhuman found a way to engage "somewhat disappointed" users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25">[01:42:25]</a>. They identified the core benefit for "must-have" users, then asked "somewhat disappointed" users (who also focused on that benefit) what features they needed to make the product a "must-have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:40">[01:42:40]</a>. This maintains focus on the core value while potentially converting fence-sitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>.

### 5. Defining an Activation Metric
Qualitatively determine when users have had a "good enough experience" with the product, then find a metric that correlates to long-term [[principles_and_practices_for_improving_retention_and_activation_metrics | retention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>. The activation moment should be "experience-based" and ideally occur in the first session or day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. It should not be so far down the user journey that it's not actionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.

## Prioritizing Activation in Growth

Shaun Ellis's approach to [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth | growth]] prioritizes activation and onboarding *before* aggressive customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.
1.  **Understand "Must-Have" Value:** Ascertain the core value proposition through the [[shaun_ellis_test_for_product_market_fit | Shaun Ellis Test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>.
2.  **Define a Northstar Metric:** Create a metric that captures "units of that value being delivered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>, reflecting how many people experience the product's core benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. This metric should be time-capped (e.g., daily active users) and correlate with revenue growth, but not *be* revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
3.  **Diagram the "Value Delivery Engine":** Map out the current state of onboarding, activation, engagement loops, and referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.
4.  **Identify High-Leverage Opportunities:** Pinpoint areas for significant improvement within the value delivery engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
5.  **Run Experiments:** Sequence experiments, starting with activation due to its criticality, followed by engagement, referral, and then optimizing the revenue model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. Only once these are optimized should a company "really obsess on the Channel Side" (acquisition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

## Challenges in Optimizing Activation

The biggest challenge in optimizing activation and broader growth is often the lack of collaboration between cross-functional teams (marketing, product, sales, customer success) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. These teams are often not accustomed to working together, making it difficult to implement effective testing programs across the entire growth engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>.

Notion, co-founded and led by Ivan Zhao, provides a compelling case study in developing productivity software that resonates with users. Its journey highlights the critical balance between a founder's vision and understanding genuine user needs.

## The "Lost Years" and Pivoting to User Needs

The initial three to four years of Notion's development were described by Zhao as "the lost years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The first version aimed to be a developer tool, enabling anyone to create their own software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. However, after a couple of years, the team realized that "most people just don't care" about creating software to optimize their daily tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Users prioritize getting their reports done and finishing their jobs over building custom tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

The initial product was more about "what I wanted than what people wanted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This realization prompted a significant shift: to "hide our vision" – that everyone can create their own software – within a form factor that people *do* care about, namely productivity software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. It took over two years to recognize the need to build a productivity tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## The "Sugar and Broccoli" Analogy

Zhao uses the analogy of "sugar and broccoli" to explain Notion's approach:
> "People don't want to eat the broccoli, but people like sugar, so give them the sugar that hide your broccoli inside of it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>

In this analogy, the "broccoli" represents the core vision of enabling users to create their own software (acting as a no-code developer tool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. The "sugar" is the immediately apparent utility as a productivity suite (notes, documents, task management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. This strategy allowed Notion to gain traction by offering a familiar and desired tool while subtly introducing its powerful, underlying modular capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Balancing Vision, Craft, and User Needs

Building a successful product and business requires a delicate balance between a founder's personal values, taste, and aesthetic, and the market's demand for users and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
*   **Too much self-focus** results in an "art project" or "research project" with no users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
*   **Too much business focus** leads to building a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

The most fulfilling and durable energy source comes from creating something "authentic to myself and happen to be also useful for others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This aligns with Notion's philosophy of how to work and be, rather than just being a productivity tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>.

The concept of "craft" is central to Notion's philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. It involves applying personal values to technical know-how, making clever trade-offs to create something "new and useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. This means constantly making trade-offs between speed and quality, and adapting to dynamic market conditions and new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

## Horizontal Product Strategy: Lego Bricks and Boxes

Notion is a horizontal product, aiming to be the "Lego for software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. This means it provides foundational "Lego bricks" (like relational databases and modular blocks) that users can combine to create various "Lego boxes" (specific solutions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:22">[00:52:22]</a>. While hardcore users appreciate the individual bricks, most people prefer pre-packaged "Lego boxes" that are ready-made solutions, especially in enterprise contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.

This strategy requires a shift in mindset:
*   **From B2C to B2B and Up-Market:** Initially, Notion focused on individual users for basic tasks like note-taking and document sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. This broad appeal created a large top-of-funnel, with personal users often bringing Notion into their workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.
*   **Segmentation and Solutions:** For enterprise customers, Notion needs to be presented as a "solution" that fits within their existing business processes and addresses specific pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>. This requires clear positioning for go-to-market and sales teams, even while continuing to build versatile underlying "bricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

Notion's success as a horizontal tool is evident in its high rankings across various categories, including project management, docs, and CRM, despite not explicitly setting out to build a CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>. Its relational database capabilities naturally allowed users to build their own CRM systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Productivity Tools

The advent of large language models (LLMs) has been a "gift" to tool builders, dramatically changing the "material" they can work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. For Notion, AI offers significant opportunities:
*   **Leveraging Centralized Data:** AI is particularly effective when all information is consolidated in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>. As a horizontal tool where users store notes, tasks, and projects, Notion has a vast surface area for AI to provide reasoning, understanding, and search capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.
*   **AI as a "Lego Builder":** One of the biggest challenges for a "Lego for software" product is that not everyone can piece together complex systems from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>. AI, particularly coding agents, is excellent at assembling components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>. This means AI can help users create various knowledge-based or customer-facing software agents within Notion, further realizing the vision of enabling more people to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. This unexpected synergy with AI is a significant development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Building User-Focused Products

*   **Patience and Persistence:** Notion spent "lost years" and rebuilt its codebase multiple times before finding product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Listen to Users, Not Just Your Vision:** While a strong vision is crucial, it must be adapted to what users actually need and care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   **Balance Authenticity and Utility:** Strive to build something authentic to your values that is also genuinely useful for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.
*   **Understand Market Dynamics:** The market cycles between "bundling" and "unbundling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. Understanding this trend helps determine whether a vertical or horizontal solution is appropriate at a given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>.
*   **Embrace Abstraction:** Thinking in terms of better abstractions and underlying systems can lead to faster progress than linear growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
*   **Continuously Learn and Adapt:** New technologies like AI change the landscape, requiring product makers to constantly reassess trade-offs and find new sweet spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Craftsmanship:** Focus on applying skill and taste to create products that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.

Ultimately, tools are extensions of humans, and once shaped by us, they can in turn shape us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. Notion aims to amplify creativity and beauty in software, aligning with a vision of fostering a better human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.

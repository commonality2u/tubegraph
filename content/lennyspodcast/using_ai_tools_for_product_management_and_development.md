[[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | Artificial intelligence]] (AI) is transforming product management, making it easier for product managers (PMs) to build and develop products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The rise of [[AI in product management | AI tooling]] is making PMs much more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This shift allows for increased efficiency and a focus on core problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

## Types of AI Product Managers

Aman Khan, Director of Product at Arise AI, categorizes [[ai_in_product_management | AI product management]] into three main types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>:

1.  **AI Platform PMs**
    These individuals build tools for AI engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. An example is Arise AI, which focuses on observability and evaluation platforms for artificial intelligence, starting with machine learning and expanding into large language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The space for tools built on top of large language model providers is nascent and currently clunky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
2.  **AI Product PMs**
    For these PMs, the core product is centered around AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Examples include ChatGPT and NotebookLM, where the core experience is enabled by the underlying AI model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The role involves packaging advanced AI technology to make it consumable for businesses, enterprises, or consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
3.  **AI-Powered PMs**
    This type of PM is enabled by AI technology across their entire role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. They utilize large language models or other models to build optimal customer experiences, even if they aren't responsible for building the core model from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Most PMs are expected to trend towards being [[future_of_product_management_with_ai | AI-powered PMs]] as AI becomes more pervasive, becoming as common as databases for SaaS applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Specific AI Tools for Product Management

[[applications_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_for_product_managers | AI tools]] enhance a PM's efficiency and productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:11:00]</a>:

Breaking into [[the_role_of_ai_in_transforming_product_management | AI product management]] is potentially easier now than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Previously, a strong foundation in machine learning was often required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Now, with the abundance of accessible tools, the focus has shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.

### Recommended Skills and Approaches

*   **Foundational Knowledge**: Start with understanding the fundamentals of machine learning and AI, including what they are and the technology behind their evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Resources like Andrej Karpathy's videos on the foundations of large language models can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
*   **Hands-On Building**: The most effective way to stand out is by demonstrating interest and building a personal skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Create a portfolio of prototypes or actual products built using AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. This showcases thinking and interests to hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
    *   It's possible to build an app in about an hour with current tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>.
    *   Use tools like Cursor, Replit, or V0 to create functional prototypes or mockups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
    *   Storyboarding ideas with Midjourney or DALL-E can also be part of this portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Curiosity-Driven Learning**: Let curiosity drive exploration of the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Being genuinely curious about the space is a vital part of the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.

## Thriving as an AI Product Manager

To excel as an [[role_and_impact_of_ai_in_product_management | AI PM]], several key practices and mindsets are crucial:

*   **Focus on the Problem, Not Just AI**: Avoid building AI solutions just because it's trending or to replicate existing foundational models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. The core responsibility is to represent the customer and solve their problems, with AI serving as a tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   A common mistake is building "another ChatGPT" on internal data, which often lacks significant usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.
    *   The right interface for AI may not always be a chatbot; it could be optimizing or speeding up existing human processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.
    *   Do not fit technology to a problem if it doesn't make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.
*   **Embrace "Wandering"**: PMs should be comfortable with uncertainty and actively explore new directions, even if the rest of the company is waiting to see what happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This pushing of boundaries to find what's possible is essential for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.
    *   This involves iterating and experimenting, knowing that some attempts will fail, but insights will be gained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.
    *   Being a "player-coach" who gets involved in the details and helps the team push forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>.
*   **Design for User Control**: Even highly automated AI products should leave "knobs and levers" for users to feel in control of the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>. This "IKEA effect" enhances user empowerment and product success, rather than simply automating the job away entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.
*   **Measure "Shots Taken"**: Since AI prototypes may not immediately impact business metrics like revenue, a metric like "how many shots are you taking" (i.e., how many prototypes are being built and tested) can be valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.
*   **Conduct Hackathons**: Organize hackathons to encourage hands-on use of AI, removing the perception that the technology is unapproachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. This helps identify the right problems to solve and where AI can genuinely stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.
*   **Amplify Signal Through Noise**: Use AI tools to extract valuable insights from large amounts of data, such as sales call transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>. This acts as a "superpower," allowing PMs to be in many places at once to gather crucial customer signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.
*   **Maintain Positive Energy**: Bringing positive energy to meetings and interactions can break down barriers and facilitate smoother conversations, even when discussing tough issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. This applies to both the demeanor in meetings and the willingness to actively engage in solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>.
*   **Have Fun**: Product management can be serious, but remembering to have fun, stay curious, and continuously learn drives iteration and long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>.

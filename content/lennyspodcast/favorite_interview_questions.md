## Favorite Interview Questions

### Aakash Mana (Head of Product at Roli, formerly PM at Stripe)
Aakash Mana asks: **"To what do you attribute your success and you can't say luck?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
She looks for [[evaluating_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | self-awareness]] and curiosity, seeking to understand if people have reflected on their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Jeff Charles (Head of Product at Ramp)
Jeff Charles asks: **"What's the hardest thing you've ever done?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
He wants to understand what "hard" means to the candidate, how they overcame the difficulty, how they collaborated, and their level of agency in resolving the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Shashir Marocha (CEO and Co-founder of Coda)
Shashir Marocha uses a hypothetical scenario: **"A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you... to be their business counterpart, bring this to market... what do you do?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
After the candidate asks initial questions, he introduces a constraint: the scientists will **"answer only two of your questions... What two questions do you ask?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
This question assesses a candidate's ability to identify the most impactful questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. An example of good questions are "Is it safe enough for humans?" and "Is it more expensive [capital expenditure] or [operating expense]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The answers to these two questions allow for a strategic market approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The low-stakes nature of the made-up scenario makes it easier for people to learn this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Kids are "incredibly good at simplifying" these things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Yuki Yamashita (Chief Product Officer at Figma, formerly Head of Design at Uber)
Yuki Yamashita asks: **"Describe to me a time when you're part of a controversial product decision."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>
He looks for candidates who can articulate the conflict, understand why it was important, and represent both sides in an "even-keeled way," demonstrating the ability to take on different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
He also asks about a big problem a candidate worked on, and the "thought experiment" is whether he feels "compelled to work on that problem" after hearing about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This tests storytelling and communication skills, which are crucial for product roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Katie Dill (Head of Design at Stripe), Ki Sarin (CEO of Linear), and Camille Hurst (Product Leader at Spotify, formerly Patreon)
These three product leaders all share the same favorite question: **"Tell me what work you are most proud of."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
This question helps understand a candidate's "taste and judgment," what motivates them, what they consider a good outcome, and what they value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. It allows candidates to share something positive and reveals their motivations, work ethic, and definition of "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### JZ (Head of Product at Webflow, formerly at Airbnb)
JZ focuses on [[behavioral_and_situational_interview_techniques | behavioral questions]], specifically seeking to understand how candidates navigate ambiguous and challenging situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
Good answers show a candidate's ability to "put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. She also looks for candidates who "seeking help" and "seeking those inputs" rather than being rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. It's important to see if they can define milestones to assess if a path is working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Noah Weiss (Chief Product Officer at Slack)
Noah Weiss asks: **"What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product to you?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>
An "unfair secret" means something not commonly known or found in a public post, demonstrating what they learned, how they learned it, how it works, and how they apply it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This question often yields interesting and inspiring insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Ben Williams (formerly VP Product at Snyk, now an Advisor)
Ben Williams asks: **"Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
He looks for "signals of humility, of [[evaluating_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | self-awareness]] around areas of personal and professional growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Candidates who can be open about areas they need to work on to grow are highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
He also generally looks for curiosity throughout interviews, noting that good PMs ask "why" constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
A brilliant question he was asked by a candidate was: **"Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> This allows the candidate to assess alignment of their personal values with the interviewer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

### Melum Quan Borwitz (Head of Growth at Deel)
Melum Quan Borwitz asks: **"What would your siblings say about you?"** (If no siblings, "What would your parents say about you?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>
She looks for sincerity and [[evaluating_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | self-awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. An answer that indicates an awareness of their flaws or quirks, rather than a perfect portrayal, suggests humbleness and self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

### Paige Castello (Co-Head of Product Management and Head of AI at Asana)
Paige Castello asks: **"Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>
This question focuses on situations where the product or team failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. She evaluates the candidate's mindset, how they discuss the situation, and how they relate to evaluating it, as it reveals how they think and perceive themselves when things aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

### Niel Singhal (VP of Product at Facebook)
Niel Singal asks: **"What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> (Or, for managers: "What's conventional wisdom that you bet against that you have found is actually inaccurate?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>
This "save question" is designed to break the typical [[interview_preparation_for_candidates | interview mindset]] where candidates try to predict what the interviewer wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. It's difficult to answer without being "genuinely opinionated," thereby testing the candidate's authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

### Io Omalo (Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health, formerly Square and Founder)
Io Omalo asks: **"Tell me something you did that worked out but not for the reason that you thought it would work,"** or **"tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>
This question is a way to "tease out [[evaluating_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | introspection]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. He wants to know if the person is reflective about their decisions and incorporates those lessons into their future model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

### Scott Belsky (Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, formerly CPO at Adobe, Founder of Behance)
Scott Belsky likes asking about **"something people have learned about themselves that reveal the limitation in how they work."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>
This tests [[evaluating_selfawareness_and_introspection_in_interviews | introspection]] and whether the person can be "open and introspective" when they struggle, rather than blaming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
He also likes to ask: **"Do you consider yourself lucky?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a> He finds it fascinating because those who are comfortable with their success should admit luck, reflecting a healthy perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Lauren Isord (Head of Growth at Notion, formerly Airtable)
Lauren Isord asks: **"Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>
She is looking for how candidates define "impact" and what it means to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. For growth practitioners, a good answer shows "intrinsic motivation about having an impact on the business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

### Paul Adams (Chief Product Officer at Intercom)
Paul Adams offers advice for reference calls: **"What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>
This is an effective question because the referee "can't dodge it" and it provides incredibly "honest" insights into the candidate's areas for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

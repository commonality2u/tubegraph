The role of the product owner (PO) has seen a surprising and significant growth in the tech job market, becoming the third fastest-growing role in the US, despite often being a separate and sometimes misunderstood function within product organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in large, non-tech companies that traditionally didn't grow up building software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:40">[02:39:40]</a>.

## Historical Context of the Product Owner Role

The [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product owner role]] did not emerge from [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product management]] as it is known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. Its origin lies within the agile movement, specifically Scrum, as a means to help developers prioritize their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

### The Agile Manifesto and Scrum

The Agile Manifesto, written in 2001 by software developers, aimed to improve software development processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Notably, no [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product managers]] were involved in its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Scrum, codified by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, became a widely adopted agile framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

The Scrum Guide, which outlines practices, introduced roles like developers, Scrum Masters, and product owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The initial 2001 Scrum Guide stated that the [[the_role_of_ownership_and_responsibility_in_product_management | product owner]] is "responsible for maximizing the value of work done," with the team doing the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. It also suggested that for commercial development, the product owner *may be* the [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product manager]], but for in-house efforts, it could be a user department manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. However, later versions, like the 2013 Scrum Guide, removed the explicit mention of the [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product manager]] being the product owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

This distinction led to a common scenario where the product owner became someone who gathered requirements, often from internal "customers" asking for features, and then managed the backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Scrum doesn't explicitly describe how items get into the backlog, focusing more on the *development* process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Challenges and Misconceptions of the Product Owner Role

The traditional product owner training often consists of a two-day class focusing on backlog management, stand-ups, and prioritizing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. It typically does *not* cover crucial aspects of [[role_of_product_managers_in_owning_the_why | product management]], such as experimentation, market research, or data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

This narrow focus has led to several issues:
*   **Tactical Focus**: Product owners often become "order takers," solely focused on translating requirements into user stories and keeping developers busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
*   **Lack of [[the_role_of_ownership_and_responsibility_in_product_management | Ownership]]**: Developers can shift responsibility for unsuccessful features to the product owner, as the PO "told them what to build" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Misunderstanding of Agile**: Many organizations equate "agile" with "Scrum" and assume adopting Scrum will solve all their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Other agile methodologies like Kanban or XP don't even have a product owner role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Meeting Overload**: Rigid adherence to Scrum practices often results in excessive meetings, leaving little time for actual work or [[role_of_product_managers_in_owning_the_why | discovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)

SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) emerged to address the desire to scale Scrum and other agile processes across large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. While not the only scaling framework, SAFe gained traction due to its detailed, prescriptive approach to tying multiple agile teams together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

However, SAFe faces significant criticism:
*   **Overkill**: It's often seen as excessively complex and bureaucratic, akin to a "plug and play" solution that simplifies complex organizational challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
*   **Separation of Roles**: SAFe explicitly separates the [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product manager]] and product owner roles. The product owner is embedded with the agile team, focused on backlog management and user stories for specific components, while the [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product manager]] sits at a higher level, engaging in customer conversations and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   **"Big Room Planning"**: This quarterly planning event, while aiming for commitment, often means teams commit to features without sufficient [[role_of_product_managers_in_owning_the_why | discovery]] or customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Strategic Guidance**: SAFe doesn't adequately describe how to do high-level [[role_of_product_managers_in_owning_the_why | product management]] work, such as portfolio strategy or how leaders (VPs of Product, CPOs) should operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Detrimental to [[key_skills_and_career_paths_for_transitioning_from_product_owner_to_product_manager | Career Paths]]**: The product owner role under SAFe often becomes purely tactical, hindering growth into more strategic [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product management]] positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **Failed Implementations**: Many companies that adopted SAFe, including Capital One, have since abandoned or significantly altered it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. One extreme example is a water company that went bankrupt due to delays caused by strict adherence to SAFe processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.

## Why Companies Adopt These Frameworks

Large, non-software-native companies (e.g., banks, insurance, pharmaceutical) often turn to frameworks like Scrum or SAFe because they seek rigor at scale and a clear operating model for building software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. These companies, often new to digital transformation, find SAFe's prescriptive nature appealing as a "handbook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Consulting firms like McKinsey have also played a significant role in promoting these frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>.

## Advice for Leaders and Organizations

For organizations embarking on digital transformations or seeking to build better products:

*   **Develop a Holistic Product Operating Model**: Don't just focus on development processes. Consider [[role_of_product_managers_in_owning_the_why | product strategy]], organizational design, [[emerging_role_of_product_operations | product operations]] (e.g., data access, customer touchpoints), culture, and incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Strategy and Value**: Ensure that product efforts are directly tied back to company goals and delivering measurable value to customers, not just shipping features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Invest in Skilled People**: While training existing staff is valuable, it's crucial to intersperse experienced product leaders (CPOs, VPs, Directors) and individual contributors who can guide the transformation and mentor less experienced team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **C-Suite Commitment**: True transformation requires buy-in and clear direction from the C-suite, rather than being driven solely by middle managers who may fear job displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.
*   **Avoid Dogmatic Processes**: While process is necessary, be flexible and willing to "inspect and adapt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Continuously evaluate if processes are serving the best interests of the company and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.
*   **Unified Career Paths**: Establish clear [[key_skills_and_career_paths_for_transitioning_from_product_owner_to_product_manager | career paths]] for product roles that allow for progression from tactical to strategic responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. Many tech companies do not have separate product owner roles; they only have product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>.

## Advice for Product Owners

If you are currently in a product owner role and aspire to grow into a [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product manager]] or more strategic position:

*   **Take [[the_role_of_ownership_and_responsibility_in_product_management | Ownership]]**: Understand that your role is more than just working with developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. Push back on features if you believe they are not the right things to work on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.
*   **Seek Customer Interaction**: If your [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product manager]] handles customer research, ask to participate or lead some research yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.
*   **Focus on Value and Outcomes**: Instead of just managing tasks, ask leaders: "What do we hope will happen when we release this? What metrics are we going to change?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.
*   **Develop [[key_skills_and_career_paths_for_transitioning_from_product_owner_to_product_manager | Product Management Skills]]**: Product owners should aim to understand [[role_of_product_managers_in_owning_the_why | product strategy]], market research, data analysis, and user experience, which are typically outside the scope of basic PO training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
*   **Question Your Career Path**: If there isn't a clear [[key_skills_and_career_paths_for_transitioning_from_product_owner_to_product_manager | career path]] for product owners, ask your leaders about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.
*   **Beware of Certifications**: While a Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certification might help secure a role in a large enterprise already using Scrum/SAFe, it's generally not valued by tech companies looking for true [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>. Focus on demonstrable experience and skills.
*   **Optimize Your Resume**: Describe your work from a value perspective, focusing on user problems solved and measurable business outcomes, rather than listing agile processes or ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. Consider using "Product Owner / Product Manager" in your title to clarify your capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.

## The Broader Outlook and Hope for [[The future of product management | Product Management]]

It is entirely possible for large, non-software-native companies to build great products consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>. The key is to:
*   **Embrace Agile Principles**: Focus on moving quickly, delivering value, and getting feedback from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Skilled People**: Successful transformations involve bringing in experienced product leaders who can guide the organization and mentor new talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>.
*   **Integrate Software Strategy**: C-suite involvement is crucial to ensure that software and digital strategies are deeply intertwined with overall company strategy, fostering innovation and competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. Chief Product Officers play a vital role in this integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a>.

Ultimately, effective [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product management]] is not about rigidly following a prescribed process, but about understanding customer needs, defining valuable outcomes, and enabling teams to build the right solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

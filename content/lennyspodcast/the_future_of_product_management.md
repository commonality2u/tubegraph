The field of [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product management]] is undergoing a significant transformation due to the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The speaker asserts that "product management is dead" or will be soon, implying a fundamental shift in [[the_future_of_product_management_in_the_ai_era | the future of product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. AI's [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | impact on product management]] is expected to be faster than anticipated, transforming product, design, and engineering roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The rate of change in technology over the last 18 to 24 months has been extremely rapid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## How AI is Changing Product Workflows

AI tools are drastically altering the daily tasks and time commitments for product professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

*   **Product Strategy Development:** What previously took weeks of intense thought and revisions to create a 10-page document can now be done in minutes using tools like ChatGPT Voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Feedback and Requirements:** Instead of days, 15 minutes can be used to scaffold an 80% complete document, with another 45 minutes for sharpening and shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Wireframing and Prototyping:** Manually drawing wireframes or using tools like Balsamiq is replaced by generating fully functional prototypes in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Manually sifting through spreadsheets for insights is replaced by automating insights with no-code tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Presentations:** Slides can now be generated by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

These changes mean that product work takes less time, requires less manual thought, and potentially fewer Product Managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This shift can make the work more enjoyable, but it requires a "straight up pivot" in how product professionals operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Becoming an AI-Powered Product Team

To thrive in this new environment, product teams must become AI-powered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This involves three key requirements for an AI-powered PM:

1.  **Automate Themselves to Speed Up Delivery:** The first task is to identify and automate repetitive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Tasks to automate include drafting documents, giving/getting passive feedback, writing updates, generating meeting agendas/summaries/action items, prioritizing feature requests, monitoring goals and OKRs, tracking competitors, prepping for interviews, consolidating candidate feedback, telling customer stories, beautifying slides, and explaining product functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The goal is to get to 75% completeness faster than starting from zero, saving days each week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
2.  **Add New Skills and Do More:** The time saved through automation should be used to expand skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Individuals like Cody, who comes from engineering and marketing backgrounds, exemplify this by learning to be an "edge prototyper" and building product in code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. They learn to use tools like Midjourney to create designs and prototypes, and even contribute to front-end code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This represents the breadth of skills that will be desired in product roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
3.  **Multiply Your [[impact_in_product_management | Impact]] by Teaching the Team:** Individual automation and skill development is not enough; knowledge must be shared across the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Creating channels for sharing ways to automate and build things with AI helps normalize the use of these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## The Collapse of the Talent Stack

AI will "collapse the talent stack," meaning that jobs previously separated will start to become one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

### Moving Beyond the Product Triad
Traditionally, product teams have operated with a "product triad" of product, engineering, and design leads, often with data and supporting resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. The problem with this model is that product often acts as a handoff mechanism, leading to a hands-off approach to what actually gets built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

The evolution is towards a "generalist specialist" model, where product, design, and engineering specialists are expected to participate across the entire building process, doing whatever work is needed to move a project forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This is encapsulated in the principle "there are no lanes" â€“ if a task needs to be done and an individual has the skill, they should do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

### The AI-Powered Triple Threat
The near future will see the emergence of an "AI power Triple Threat": one person capable of leading a team by combining engineering, design, and product skills, leveraging AI tools, agents, and platforms as part of their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. While these individuals may specialize in one area, they will need to be proficient in all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This shift suggests that individuals can move faster than small teams, enabling opinionated product leadership to drive things forward more rapidly with the right tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Product managers will also be expected to be more commercially oriented and use data tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_product_management | Challenges in Product Management]] for Leaders

AI will also impact product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Leaders must be prepared to manage new types of teams, get more commercial and technical skills into their teams, and manage people who can code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The shift means budgeting for headcount will evolve to budgeting for agents and tools, changing how R&D investment is viewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

Leaders will need to create "artisanally crafted team topologies," building teams specifically for the tasks that need to be done, rather than rigid structures like the triad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. This means organizing around motivated individuals with diverse skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

Product leaders' existing experience and strategy are becoming a commodity, as AI can now generate high-quality strategic documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. To maintain relevance, leaders need to skill up and build a "moat" around what they can bring to the table, such as running, building, and scaling these new AI-powered teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. This transition is happening fast, requiring proactive change rather than becoming obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

The message is clear: "AI will never do this thing is super naive, but AI can help me do anything is really inspiring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Product leaders should find "AI powered triple threats," empower them, and provide them with the necessary budget for [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | career growth and impact for product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

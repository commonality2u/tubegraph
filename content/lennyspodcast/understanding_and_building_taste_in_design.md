Taste, often perceived as an innate quality, is presented as a skill that can be developed and refined, particularly in the context of product design and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Developing Taste

Developing taste is primarily about increasing one's exposure to products and user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.

> [!TIP] Increase Exposure Hours
> An internal operating principle at Versell is "increasing exposure hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. This means:
> *   Trying many different products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.
> *   Quantifying time spent watching how people use *your* products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>.
> *   Observing how people use *other* products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.
> *   Actively seeking feedback within the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.

This constant exposure helps build the "muscle" of taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:54">[01:08:54]</a>. It's crucial to "expose yourself to the pain of reality" by observing actual user interactions, which helps designers and developers become more grounded and humble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>.

## AI's Role in Taste and Design

AI tools like V0ero are designed to infuse "best practices" and common principles of good web design into their outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. This allows them to create "very nice designs out of the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.

### Steering AI with Eloquence and Vocabulary

While AI provides good defaults, human input is still vital for steering the design in a specific direction and preventing all products from looking the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. This requires:
*   **Eloquence and linguistic ability**: Knowing the right "tokens" or descriptive words to communicate desired styles and effects to the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. For example, using words like "turbulence" to describe an animation effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.
*   **Referencing inspirations**: Guiding the model by referring to existing styles or brands (e.g., "in the style of Supreme," "Charles Schwab," "sepia style") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.
*   **Iterative feedback**: Continuously giving feedback to the AI, even simple commands like "try something else" or "make it pop," to refine the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>. This iterative process, similar to working with a human design firm, allows for constant adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[the_role_of_intuition_and_taste_in_product_development | Intuition and Taste]]
> The ability to "steer the model" and apply personal "creativity" is essential, as AI does not always know exactly what a user wants or needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. It functions as a copilot or assistant rather than a sole decision-maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>.

## Achieving Product Quality

Ultimately, achieving product quality, which is closely tied to refined taste, still requires significant effort and attention to detail. This involves "blood, sweat, and tears" and the understanding that a great product consists of "a thousand little details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>. This dedication, combined with extensive use and testing of one's own products (dogfooding), is crucial for continuous [[improving_user_experience_and_product_quality | improvement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:22:17]</a>.

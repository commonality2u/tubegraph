The emerging role of product operations is crucial for scaling [[the_operating_model_in_product_management | product management]] and ensuring efficient execution, particularly in rapidly scaling companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>. Melissa Perry, a product expert, is currently writing a book on this topic, anticipating its release by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Why Product Operations Emerged

Product operations became exciting to Melissa due to the lack of data for leaders attempting to set strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. When [[transforming_to_a_productbased_operating_model | organizations undergo transformations]] and product teams scale, existing systems often break down because they don't scale with the increased number of product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.

Common [[trends_and_challenges_in_product_management | problems product teams face]] that product operations aims to solve include:
*   **Lack of Standardization** Roadmaps, time horizons, and data formats differ across teams, making it impossible to roll up information into a cohesive strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   **Missing Career Ladders** For product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
*   **Inefficient Meetings** Too many meetings occur with the wrong people in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Data Access Issues** Product managers struggle to get the data needed to make informed decisions on product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>.
*   **Ineffective Customer Research** Customers are often bothered repeatedly by different teams, and user interviews are not recorded or easily searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>. This was a significant issue at Athenahealth, where 350 product managers were inadvertently harassing the same hospital staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

Essentially, [[the_future_of_product_management | product management]] at scale is inherently difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.

## Key Functions of Product Operations

Product operations helps deliver the right insights to teams and standardize outputs and check-ins to keep efforts aligned with the correct strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. It typically comprises three main areas:

### 1. Internal Data and Insights
This function involves a dedicated team that gathers and surfaces data from various internal systems, such as financial data and user analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. Their role is to:
*   Help leaders make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   Provide inputs necessary for strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.
*   Monitor strategy progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.
*   Track Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

Leaders are advised to [[hiring_and_roles_in_product_management | hire]] data analysts or leverage consultants who are skilled at crunching data to find patterns and answer critical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.

### 2. Customer Research and User Insights
This area focuses on gathering and utilizing external data and market research to inform strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. This includes:
*   Subscribing to industry publications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.
*   Consulting subject matter experts for market movement advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>.
*   Standardizing the approach for product managers to talk to customers, avoiding repeated contact with the same individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>.
*   Recording user interviews in a searchable format to easily revisit information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

The goal is to scale and make user research more efficient, rather than centralizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.

### 3. Standardization of Processes and Cadences
This involves formalizing routines and processes that impact multiple divisions within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. Examples include:
*   Defining monthly roadmap check-ins, including who should be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.
*   Structuring quarterly planning sessions with executives, detailing inputs, outputs, and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.
*   Standardizing communication formats, such as how roadmaps are shared with sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

Product operations does *not* standardize processes that only affect individual teams internally, like daily stand-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>. Instead, it focuses on ensuring smooth working relationships between product and other departments like sales and product marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.

Roz Herberg, Chief Marketing Officer and VP of Product Strategy at Wiz, has a unique [[strategies_for_career_growth_and_breaking_into_product_management | career path]] that transitioned from engineering to product management and then to marketing leadership, a journey she describes as non-traditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. She emphasizes following "good people" rather than a rigid career plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

## Background at Wiz
Roz joined Wiz as the first product manager and the seventh employee, at a time when the founders hadn't fully solidified their product idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The company was officially founded as "Beyond Networks" with an initial focus on network security, despite the founding team's background in cloud security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

In the early weeks, Roz and the team conducted 10-15 meetings daily with potential customers. Despite positive feedback like "sounds interesting," Roz, as the product manager responsible for building, still didn't understand what they were supposed to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This confusion led her to question the direction, initiating a deep discussion among the founders. This conversation ultimately led to a pivot to cloud security, a domain they knew best, and things "started to click" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

## The Shift to Marketing Leadership
Around two and a half years into Wiz, with clear product-market fit and a functioning sales team, the company still faced challenges with marketing and awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. Customers were discovering Wiz only after signing with competitors, which indicated a significant gap in their go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

Wiz's CEO, Asaf, asked Roz to take on marketing, a suggestion she initially found "bizarre" due to her background solely in engineering and product, with no prior exposure to go-to-market strategies or terms like "pipeline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. After a weekend of intense research, listening to podcasts and speaking with CMOs, she decided to accept the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. She recognized that figuring out marketing was the next major hurdle for the company to scale, believing that "brand matters a lot" even for complex B2B products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

## The "Heat" Metaphor
Roz describes the shifting focus within a rapidly growing company using a "heat" metaphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>:
*   **Early Days:** Heat is in product, as everyone waits for something to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.
*   **Post-Product:** Heat moves to engineering to build and make the product work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.
*   **Initial Sales:** Heat shifts to sales to close deals after initial clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   **Scaling:** Heat moves to marketing when sales needs more pipeline and brand awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>.

## Marketing Insights from a Product Lens
Having a product background shaped Roz's [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | approach to marketing]]:

### Why CMOs Often Fail
Roz believes the CMO role is "very, very hard" and requires deep trust with the founding team and a profound connection to the product and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. A single misaligned ad can easily break this trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. She feels it's especially challenging for someone without a direct background in a technical market like security to succeed as a CMO for Wiz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. The role is also incredibly diverse, managing disparate functions like performance marketing, brand design, and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

### Product vs. Marketing Risks
Roz drew a sharp distinction between product and marketing decisions:
*   **Product:** "Less is more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. Adding a feature consumes valuable engineering time and is difficult to remove, potentially complicating the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Mistakes here have a "huge cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.
*   **Marketing:** "Quite the opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. There's "no cost to anything," "no maintenance," "no technical debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. If a marketing effort fails (e.g., a video nobody likes), "nothing happened," and a different approach can be tried the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

### "Make Noise" Strategy
Leveraging the low-cost nature of marketing mistakes, Roz adopted a "try everything" approach to "make noise" and get Wiz's name out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. An example was the RSA conference, a major security event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>. Instead of a typical cyber booth, she transformed Wiz's space into a "Wiz of Oz Booth" with actors and a completely different, positive, and optimistic brand aesthetic (pink, bright blue, magic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. This daring approach, while scary, resulted in five times more visitors than the previous year and influenced other cyber companies to adopt similar themed booths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.

### Lessons for Product Leaders
From her marketing vantage point, Roz gained crucial insights for product leaders:
*   **Criticality of Marketing:** She realized she previously didn't fully understand the "criticality of marketing and even of product marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. Marketing bridges the gap between deep technical product knowledge and the common person in the market or a salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.
*   **Clarity of Message:** Product teams can sometimes be comfortable with "fluffy," "blurry," or "gray" explanations internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. However, for messages to scale through marketing, they must be "crystal clear, black and white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. Fuzzy signals get lost in translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.
*   **The "Dummy Explanation":** Roz advocates for the "dummy explanation" in all marketing materials. This means not assuming deep prior knowledge about Wiz, its product, or the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. For example, instead of using industry initials like "CNAP" for Cloud Native Application Protection, it's better to use terms people actually Google, like "Cloud Security Solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>. This requires constantly reminding oneself about the "bubble" of internal company knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.

## Embracing Failure and Imposter Syndrome
A core part of Roz's approach is being "okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail at something and still attempting it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>. This mindset, fostered by her mother's emphasis on pushing beyond comfort zones ("friction is good") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>, allows her to take risks and learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

She advises embracing imposter syndrome rather than fighting it. For those feeling like imposters, she suggests acknowledging it but "don't let that stop you from making a decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. The only way to know your limit is to try, even if you think you'll fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.

## Working with Founders
Roz highlights the "truly incredible" Wiz founding team, who have worked together for over 20 years across various ventures, including their previous company Adallom (sold to Microsoft) and even the Israeli army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>. Their unique relationship is built on complete trust and clear domain ownership, enabling fast decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

The culture at Wiz is "very flat" and open, where employees are believed in and given opportunities to drive impact regardless of title or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>. This fosters high loyalty among employees, as everyone feels part of what's being built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>. This supportive environment was crucial for Roz's own [[transitioning_into_product_management | transition]] and influence within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

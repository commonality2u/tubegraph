[[first_principles_thinking_in_leadership_and_entrepreneurship | First principles thinking]] is a core tenet of product development at Ramp, a company known for its exceptional velocity and rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. This approach allows Ramp to innovate and solve problems in unique ways, rather than relying on conventional wisdom or past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

## Defining First Principles Thinking
At its essence, [[first_principles_thinking_in_leadership_and_entrepreneurship | first principles thinking]] means not simply patterning from past experiences, but rather returning to the fundamental aspects of a problem and thinking through them deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. It requires individuals to set aside preconceived notions and challenge assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

## Application at Ramp
[[first_principles_thinking_in_leadership_and_entrepreneurship | First principles thinking]] is particularly crucial for Ramp due to the unique nature of its business, which combines elements of:
*   Credit card services (risk management, underwriting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>
*   Payments (money movement between businesses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>
*   Software (spend and expense management, accounting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>
*   Both Product-Led Growth (PLG) for SMEs and sales-driven strategies for Enterprise clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>

Because Ramp operates in a multifaceted environment where "something hasn't been done before," relying on traditional patterns or benchmarks is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. Even the Head of Product, Jeff Charles, had to [[first_principles_thinking_in_leadership_and_entrepreneurship | shift his product development process]] entirely when joining Ramp because his previous process was predicated on a different caliber of engineering team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

### Example: Support Team Structure
A clear example of [[first_principles_thinking_in_leadership_and_entrepreneurship | first principles thinking]] at Ramp is the organization of its support team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.
Instead of pattern matching industry standards, Ramp started with fundamental principles:
*   **Principle 1:** Every support ticket represents a failure of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Principle 2:** A significant portion of Ramp's value to customers would come from deeply understanding and responding to their feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

Based on these principles, Ramp structured its support team to report directly into the product organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>. Furthermore, instead of incentivizing agents to merely resolve tickets, they are incentivized to decrease the *number* of tickets over time and increase deflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. This unique approach has led to:
*   An extremely low contact rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>
*   A team of under 30 agents supporting over 400,000 users, an "insane" ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.

## Hiring for First Principles Thinking
Ramp actively seeks candidates who can demonstrate [[first_principles_thinking_in_leadership_and_entrepreneurship | first principles thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This means:
*   **Openness to Discard Experience:** Being comfortable setting aside past experiences and not relying on "I've seen this before" as an argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.
*   **Deep Thinking:** The ability to think deeply about decisions and trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.
*   **Curiosity:** Understanding the broader business context, including how the company makes money, customer preferences, and project importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.
*   **Proactiveness and Accountability:** Engineers who proactively jump in to solve problems, get feedback, or fix bugs, even if it's "not their job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>.

Ramp prioritizes these qualities over sheer experience, believing that the ability to think fundamentally about problems is more valuable than direct pattern matching, especially in a unique and fast-evolving business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.

> "You don't pattern match from your past experience but you go back to the fundamentals of what we're trying to do and you think through them very very deeply." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>

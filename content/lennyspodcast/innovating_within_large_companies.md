## Overview of Innovation Principles
Successfully [[inventiveness_and_innovation_in_business | innovating within large companies]] requires a blend of urgency, optimism, and long-term strategic thinking. Jeff Weinstein, a product leader at Stripe, describes this approach as a "go go go plus optimistic, long-term compounding philosophy of [[building_and_scaling_product_innovations | Building Products]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:09">[02:02:09]</a>. This means acting swiftly and optimistically while continuously investing in foundational capabilities that yield benefits over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Go Go Go Plus Long-Term Compounding
The "go go go" aspect encourages immediate action and injecting energy, leading to surprising results and igniting interest in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>. This can involve making deadlines immediate (e.g., "let's just make it due tomorrow") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

However, not all problems can be solved quickly; some require layers of infrastructure, services, applications, and partnerships that take time to build, like an iceberg with only the top visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>. Examples of long-term investments that are "never regretted" include improving the latency or reliability of payment APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. The challenge lies in balancing this "go go go" attitude with a strategic, compounding mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>.

An example from Stripe's global expansion illustrates this balance: initially, a "go go go" approach to adding countries and payment methods was not working, leading to flat growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. The team had to slow down, build internal platforms, and send people worldwide to establish these methods, which caused a temporary flatline before exponential growth (from 10 to over 100 payment methods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>.

## Strategies for [[building_new_products_within_larger_companies | Building new products within larger companies]]

### Customer Obsession and Direct Engagement
A key strategy is to break the "wall between the PM and the customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This involves:
*   **Active Listening, Not Pitching:** When talking to customers, avoid pitching the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Instead, sit in silence and wait for them to open up about their "most burning problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Asking questions like "what would you be working on if you weren't talking to me?" or "what do you wish you could just have off your plate immediately?" can reveal critical needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **Rapid Response:** A customer reaching out about a problem is an "unbelievable gift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Respond quickly, even if it's just to acknowledge their message, to build trust and create a "secret portal" between them and the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. This is crucial for turning detractors into promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.
*   **Targeted Feedback:** While managing overwhelming feedback, prioritize by asking for detailed screenshots or videos, or structured emails with bullet points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. Focus only on feedback from *paying customers* as friends might offer friendly but irrelevant input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. The "paying" aspect acts as a forcing function to reveal true value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.
*   **"Practice Paying":** For B2B products, encourage potential customers to literally "practice paying" (e.g., sending a $1 invoice) to ensure they understand the payment flow and truly value the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>.

### Strategic Use of Metrics
Metrics are essential for achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.
*   **Customer-Centric Metrics:** Metrics should be a numerical representation of the value produced for the customer, measured from their perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. Instead of internal measures like "log-ins," focus on "how many people accomplished what they were trying to do after they logged in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
*   **Single Overarching Metric:** Choose one clear metric that entire teams can rally around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. For Stripe Atlas, the key metric was "companies that have no support tickets through the incorporation service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. This shifted from 15% to 85% over 18 months, directly correlating with market share growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. This metric helped empower engineers to act as "PMs" by addressing specific support tickets to improve the overall product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.
*   **"Users Having a Bad Day" Metric:** A universal metric for any business is tracking "users having a bad day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. This involves emitting a log line whenever a user encounters a problem (e.g., 404 error, payout delay, payment declines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. Visualizing these as a stacked bar chart reveals frequencies and highlights unexpected issues, prompting immediate action to understand and address them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.
*   **Metric Hygiene:** Ensure metric titles are concise and customer-focused (e.g., "companies with zero support tickets") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. Maintain consistent formatting (e.g., decimal places, x-axis) on dashboards to encourage frequent review by the entire team, fostering a shared understanding of customer heartbeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This transparency builds trust and aligns teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>.

### "Study Groups" for Empathy and Quality (Stripe Example)
To combat product "rot" in large organizations where individual teams focus on new features while existing ones degrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>, Jeff Weinstein initiated "study groups" at Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>.
*   **Format:** A random group of 4-8 employees (from any department) pretends to be a company with a specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.
*   **Rules:**
    1.  **"You do no longer work at Stripe"**: Participants must not use any internal Stripe knowledge and embody the customer's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>. The facilitator strictly enforces this, pausing the session if internal knowledge is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>.
    2.  **"We're not here to solve any problems"**: The focus is solely on practicing empathy and experiencing the product as a customer, not on critiquing or filing bugs during the session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.
*   **Impact:** Over 25 study groups involving 250+ people took place in early 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. These sessions are deeply eye-opening, revealing how difficult it can be for customers to accomplish tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>. The findings are funneled into existing bug tracking processes, and teams are naturally motivated to act upon seeing colleagues struggle with their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:19">[01:32:19]</a>.

### Overcoming [[challenges_and_changes_in_large_company_structures | Challenges and changes in large company structures]]
*   **Momentum over Perfection:** Cut through red tape by focusing on small, tangible forward progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:59">[02:06:59]</a>. Start with a "Sharpie" vision of an "unconstrained perfect solution," then work to get one basic version working quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:57">[02:04:57]</a>. "Proof of existence" (e.g., sending a blank piece of paper to prove a mailing system works) is powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:29">[02:06:29]</a>.
*   **Empowering Teams:** Present solutions as stemming from deep customer stories rather than personal ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:10">[02:04:10]</a>. This encourages buy-in and makes progress feel like a collective effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:46">[02:04:46]</a>.
*   **Economic Viability:** Clearly communicate the economic value of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:24">[02:09:24]</a>. Whether it's a customer acquisition tool, a margin generator, or an ecosystem builder, metrics must demonstrate its contribution to the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:31">[02:09:31]</a>.
*   **[[innovative_hiring_practices_in_startups | Innovative hiring practices in startups]]/Teams**: Building diverse teams from the outset is crucial for bringing varied perspectives and avoiding the "down funnel problem" where candidates from different backgrounds don't want to join a homogeneous team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:05">[01:56:05]</a>.

## Stripe Atlas as a Case Study
Stripe Atlas is a service designed to radically simplify the process of starting a company, particularly for global entrepreneurs who once had to fly to the U.S. to access its financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10">[01:39:10]</a>. The core mission is to "dramatically lower the barrier to great people solving problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>.

Recent innovations include automating complex administrative steps like the 83(b) election, a critical but "Byzantine" IRS filing process that used to require sending physical mail within 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:30">[01:41:30]</a>. By automating this and other steps (share purchases, EIN, etc.), Atlas now allows companies to be incorporated in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. This automation involves working with third-party vendors for tasks like printing and mailing, enabling the small 10-person Atlas team to achieve significant leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:54">[01:50:54]</a>.

The impact of Atlas is significant:
*   One in six new Delaware Corporations are started on Stripe Atlas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   Companies started on Atlas in 2024 are reaching \$50 million in revenue twice as quickly as those in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:21">[01:49:21]</a>.
*   Over 55,000 companies have started through Atlas to date, generating \$5 billion a year in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:09">[01:50:09]</a>.
*   The automation has led to more solo founders using Atlas, as they can achieve more with no-code tools and less administrative burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:25">[01:48:25]</a>.
*   A survey found that about 20% of users would not have started their business without Atlas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:21">[02:02:21]</a>.

This commitment to deeply solving administrative burdens for founders elevates expectations for other tools and fosters more entrepreneurial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:29">[01:50:29]</a>. Even when facing competitors, Stripe maintained an open relationship, leading to AngelList eventually directing their incorporation users to Atlas due to its superior product and long-term focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:06">[02:10:06]</a>. This highlights that [[balancing_startup_agility_and_big_company_operations | alternatives]] and partnerships are more important than rigid competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:12">[02:14:12]</a>.

When discussing pricing, many people quickly focus on dollar figures, but price is fundamentally a measure of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This perspective highlights the crucial question: Do people actually want your product and would they buy it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> This leads to the concept of [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Madhavan Ramanujam, author of "Monetizing Innovation," emphasizes that achieving product-market fit is not enough; businesses must strive for *product-market-pricing fit* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## What is Segmentation (and what it's not)

While "segmentation" is a widely understood term, many companies define it incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. Often, segmentation is mistakenly viewed as a demographic or persona exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. Basing segmentation purely on personas can lead to significant errors because individuals with similar demographics (e.g., a 70+ year old, wealthy UK resident) can have dramatically different needs, values, and [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] (e.g., King Charles vs. Ozzy Osbourne) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.

True segmentation must be based on:
*   What customers *need* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>
*   What they *value* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>
*   What they are [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willing to pay for]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>

The key is to "productize to segments," rather than building a single product and trying to [[role_of_positioning_in_sales_and_marketing | position]] it differently for various personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. Needs are heterogeneous across industries, and businesses must identify this heterogeneity to effectively serve different customer groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. Building a "one-size-fits-all" product often results in a "one-size-fits-none" outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

### The "You Act Differently" Framework
A key indicator of correct segmentation is the ability to "act differently" for each segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. This means:
*   **You** (your product, sales, marketing, and finance teams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>
*   **Act** (come up with new products, build business cases, develop product marketing messages, and sales strategies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>
*   **Differently** (there's a distinct treatment for each segment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>

If you understand a segment's needs, values, and [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]], your interactions and product offerings for them will be distinct from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>. This involves finding significant market sizes where needs and [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] are similar, then building and targeting products specifically for those segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.

## When to Think About Segmentation

Early-stage founders often believe they lack the time or resources to build multiple products for different segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>. However, understanding segmentation from the outset is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. During initial [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] conversations, founders should identify:
*   Who is [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willing to pay]] for their innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>
*   What those customers need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>
*   The size of those customer groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>

This prioritization guides the R&D roadmap, informing which segment to target first and which product to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. Focusing on the right segment with tailored value messaging ensures the product resonates with its intended audience upon launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. A "lazy and sloppy" approach of building one product and hoping it attracts everyone will likely attract no one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.

## Examples of Effective Segmentation

*   **Water:** The same water is priced differently based on the customer's need: free from a fountain, $2 in a bottle, $2.50 with gas, or $5 from a mini-bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. This illustrates productizing to different needs and [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.
*   **Apple:** Instead of a single iPhone, Apple offers models ranging from $299 to $1499, each [[differentiation_and_lowcost_strategy | differentiated]] and productized for different segments and price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>. This strategy contributes to Apple's profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.
*   **Eventbrite:** Before its IPO, Eventbrite transitioned from a single product to three distinct plans, tailoring features like ticket types (single vs. unlimited) to meet the varied needs of customers, from local wine clubs to professional event organizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.
*   **Uber:** Uber's different car types (UberX, Uber Black, Uber Pool, Comfort) are a prime example of segmentation. They cater to varying needs based on price sensitivity, desire for quiet, or convenience, sometimes even allowing a single user to switch segments depending on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>. The focus is increasingly on "dynamic segmentation," understanding how people switch segments based on time and situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.

## Unlocking Segmentation through Packaging and Bundling

Packaging and bundling are crucial for unlocking segmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This involves configuring products based on customer needs, values, and [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.

### Leaders, Fillers, and Killers Framework
This framework helps identify how to combine features or products:
*   **Leaders:** The core product or "must-have" features that over 50% of people want and are [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willing to pay for]] (e.g., the burger in a Happy Meal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. These are often the "must-have table stakes" identified in [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | willingness to pay]] conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>.
*   **Fillers:** "Nice-to-have" items that, when bundled with a leader product, encourage purchase at a marginal price increase (e.g., french fries and Coke in a Happy Meal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>.
*   **Killers:** Features or products that, if included in a bundle, would make it unattractive to most customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>. These are best offered as add-ons, particularly if only a small percentage (10-20%) of customers strongly desire them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>. This ensures maximum value is unlocked without depreciating the bundle's appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>.

By understanding leaders, fillers, and killers, companies can configure products to effectively cater to different segments and maximize value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.

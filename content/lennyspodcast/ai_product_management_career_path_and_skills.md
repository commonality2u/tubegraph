Aman Khan, Director of Product at Arise AI, discusses the evolving landscape of [[ai_in_product_management | AI product management]], offering insights on how to enter the field, the different types of AI Product Managers (AIPMs), and strategies for success as an individual contributor (IC) in this domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. His career has focused on building products in the AI space at companies like Spotify, Cruise, Zipline, and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## What is an AI Product Manager (AIPM)?

A Product Manager (PM) is responsible for bringing together design, engineering, business development, operations, and sales to ship impactful solutions for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. An [[ai_in_product_management | AI Product Manager]] adds the component of focusing on artificial intelligence.

Aman Khan identifies three main types of [[differences_between_types_of_ai_product_managers | AI Product Managers]]:

1.  **AI Platform PMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>
    *   These PMs build tools for AI Engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
    *   An example is Arise AI, which provides an observability and evaluation platform for artificial intelligence, starting with machine learning models and now pivoting to general AI, including large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Their tools enable AI Engineers to understand the impact of their applications and communicate it to leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

2.  **AI Product PMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>
    *   In this role, the core product itself is centered around AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
    *   Examples include ChatGPT or Google's NotebookLM, where the core experience is enabled by the underlying AI model, which serves as the "secret sauce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
    *   The PM's job is to package this cutting-edge technology to make it consumable for businesses, enterprises, or consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

3.  **AI Powered PMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>
    *   This type of PM is enabled by [[using_ai_tools_for_product_management and development | AI technology]] across their entire role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
    *   They don't necessarily build the core AI model from the ground up, but rather utilize LLMs or other models to create the best experience for their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
    *   Aman believes that in the near future, most PMs will likely become some flavor of an [[ai_in_product_management | AI product manager]], as AI becomes as common as databases for SaaS applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_product_managers | Career Path]] to Becoming an AIPM

Breaking into [[ai_in_product_management | AI product management]] is now potentially easier than before, as building apps with AI is more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Previously, a deeper foundation in machine learning was often required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### Essential Skills and Knowledge

*   **Foundational Knowledge**: Start by understanding the fundamentals of machine learning and AI, exploring the knowledge that powered its evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Resources like Andrej Karpathy's videos on the foundations of LLMs can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   **Curiosity and Application**: Be driven by curiosity to explore how to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Apply this knowledge to solve problems in industries that interest you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Problem-First Approach**: Be in love with the problem you're trying to solve, using [[ai_in_product_management | AI]] as a tool to push technological boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding Boundaries**: Comprehend the capabilities and limitations of AI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

### Standing Out as an Applicant

*   **Build a Portfolio**: Since there isn't a specific college degree for [[ai_in_product_management | AI product management]], building a portfolio of products you've attempted to create, even if they are just prototypes, can help you stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This demonstrates your thinking process, interests, and hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Utilize AI Tools for Prototyping**: Tools like Cursor, Replit, and Vercel's v0 can help you build functional prototypes and landing pages quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Image generation tools like Midjourney or DALL-E can assist with graphic design, logos, or visual user stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Instead of just describing what you can do, show what you've built. For example, Replit's AI agent can build and host a website within seconds from a prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Strategic Approach to AI Product Development

*   **Avoid Replication**: Don't simply build another version of an existing AI interface (like a chatbot) just because it's familiar or everyone else is doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Ask if it truly solves a business problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Redefine Interfaces**: The ideal interface for AI might not look like a chatbot; it could optimize or speed up human processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Problem**: The [[impact of AI on product management | role of AI]] is to help solve customer problems, not just to integrate AI for its own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Companies should focus on core problems and see how AI can be a tool to solve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage Existing Models**: Instead of trying to design new AI models or agent frameworks from scratch, which requires cutting-edge researchers, focus on taking existing technology and applying it innovatively within your organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

### Tips for Finding Good AI-Oriented Ideas

1.  **Develop an AI Metric**: Implement a metric to measure the impact of AI within your business, especially for prototypes or non-revenue-generating AI applications. This helps understand if what you're doing is working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
2.  **Host Hackathons**: Encourage hands-on experimentation with AI tools across the organization to make the technology more approachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Present problems for teams to solve with AI, understanding that not every application will be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
    *   *Example*: A hackathon project to build a Slackbot for customer support failed due to missing context in the data, highlighting the importance of identifying the right problems for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
3.  **Obsess Over User Experience Details**: Analyze successful AI products to understand what makes them "magical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
    *   *The Betty Crocker Effect*: People often want some control over the experience, even if automation is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Similar to Betty Crocker's cake mix needing the addition of eggs to boost sales, or self-driving cars still allowing control over AC/music, leaving some "knobs and levers" for users can increase empowerment and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. AI should make products easier to use and lower the barrier to creation, not just automate everything away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

### Balancing Innovation and Execution

*   **"Walk and Chew Gum"**: As an AIPM, your job is to solve customer problems, not just ship AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. You must continuously deliver customer value while simultaneously making space for prototyping, trying new tools, conducting tear-downs of other AI products, and experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. These exploratory activities, while not directly moving KPIs, are crucial for learning and adapting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace Change and Failure**: The technology is evolving rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Accept that some experiments will fail, but the goal is to keep iterating, as this is how AI improves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### [[applications_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_for_product_managers | Amplifying Signal with AI]]

*   **Scale Yourself with AI**: Use AI tools to gain insights from large amounts of data. For example, feeding transcripts of sales calls (e.g., from Gong) into large language models with long context windows can help identify common customer pain points or prospect discussions, scaling your ability to gather signal from noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

### Mindsets for Success as an IC PM

1.  **Bring Energy**: Showing up with energy can reduce friction in meetings and encourage collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This includes maintaining a positive tone and actively engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. It also means being willing to "do the thing" yourself, like jumping into sales outreach to understand customer problems firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Being a "player-coach" who is involved in the tough details fosters empathy and pushes the team forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
2.  **Wander vs. Wait**: While companies may lean towards waiting to see how new technologies develop, the role of a PM, especially in [[ai_in_product_management | AI]], is to be a "Wanderer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This means venturing into the unknown to find the right direction for the team and pushing the boundaries of what the company believes is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Be comfortable with not knowing the exact path, and keep iterating until the product finds its "drag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
3.  **Have Fun**: Maintain curiosity and enjoy the journey of learning and building products for customers you care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Having fun leads to faster iteration and greater fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

Figma's Chief Product Officer, Yuki Yamashida, highlights key principles and practices that define [[figmas_product_development_philosophy | Figma's product development philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">[01:33:40]</a>. These include a strong emphasis on understanding customer needs, fostering internal accountability, and maintaining an adaptive, experimental approach to product strategy.

## Core Principles

### Owning the "Why"

For product managers (PMs) at Figma, owning the "why" behind a product or idea is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>. While the "what" and "how" can be shared responsibilities, the "why" is uniquely the PM's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>. This approach was learned from scaling at YouTube, where PMs couldn't dictate every detail, requiring designers and engineers to understand the core problem to make effective localized decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:29">[02:01:29]</a>.

Figma's engineering team employs the "five whys" technique in retrospectives to uncover root causes of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:57">[02:14:57]</a>. PMs similarly apply this to customer feedback, not just addressing feature requests, but delving into why those problems exist in the first place to identify deeper, impactful solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:30">[02:16:30]</a>.

### Customer Proximity and Obsession

Figma has an "obsession with a proximity to customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:48">[02:40:48]</a>. This deep connection stems from the company's origin, where CEO Dylan Field continuously sought and incorporated feedback from designers, turning them into product evangelists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>. This community engagement has profoundly shaped the product and continues to drive its adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:22">[02:59:22]</a>.

Figma's teams actively engage with the community, often using Twitter to solicit feedback on new features or strategic focus areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:57">[02:49:57]</a>. Dylan Field himself is known for reading extensive customer feedback, including tweets with minimal engagement, to find the "essence of truth" in even minor complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:51">[03:09:51]</a>. This top-down emphasis on customer closeness is critical, balancing vocal minority feedback with broader data from support tickets and sales conversations to ensure a comprehensive understanding of user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:09">[02:55:09]</a>.

### Internal Dogfooding and Accountability

[[Focusing on craft and quality in product development | Building high-quality software]] at Figma is greatly aided by internal use of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:54">[03:27:54]</a>. Designers internally spend six hours a day in Figma, providing constant feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:48">[03:44:48]</a>. Product managers even shifted from a memo culture to a deck culture to leverage Figma for presentations, thereby increasing their daily engagement with the tool and identifying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:07">[03:55:07]</a>. Recent initiatives, like using FigJam for performance review calibrations, further embed the product into internal workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:33">[03:57:33]</a>.

This internal usage fosters a sense of personal accountability among employees. When a developer or designer personally experiences a problem with the product, they feel a strong, almost embarrassing, motivation to fix it, which drives significant quality improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:32">[03:58:32]</a>.

### Experimentation and Adapting OKR Philosophy

Figma runs experiments constantly, and not all yield winning results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>. An example is the "branching and merging" feature for design systems, which initially saw low adoption despite significant investment due to performance issues and unfamiliar workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:03">[03:52:03]</a>. This highlighted a need to develop new methods for understanding effectiveness when building features for new customer types that Figma employees might not use internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:03">[03:52:03]</a>.

Yuki Yamashida describes a "love-hate relationship" with OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:58">[04:55:58]</a>. He found that OKRs sometimes became performative task lists or relied on secondary metrics that weren't truly impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:40">[05:14:40]</a>. Initially, he deprecated formal OKRs, asking teams to focus on philosophical headlines and desired outcomes rather than strict metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:03">[05:43:03]</a>. While they later reintroduced OKRs with more rigor, the challenge remains ensuring teams are genuinely committed to moving them, not just documenting projects that were already in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:07">[06:05:07]</a>.

Yuki's current philosophy on effective goal setting, regardless of the terminology (OKR or "commitment"), emphasizes three qualities:
*   **Legendary**: Clear and understandable to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:06">[06:42:06]</a>.
*   **Actionability**: Inspires specific actions and changes in behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:06">[06:56:06]</a>.
*   **Authenticity**: Honestly reflects the team's daily efforts and true objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:06">[07:04:06]</a>.

## [[The art and role of product management | The Art and Role of Product Management]]

### [[building_a_productoriented_engineering_culture | Building a Product-Oriented Engineering Culture]]

Yuki Yamashida views product management as an interdisciplinary function that provides exposure to all other areas of a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. He highlights that managing designers is harder than managing product managers, as designers often prioritize developing their craft, which may not always align with the company's biggest problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:12">[10:40:12]</a>. Product managers, in contrast, are generally driven by impact and seek to work on the company's most important problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:06">[11:12:06]</a>.

A core skill for PMs is storytelling, which Yuki considers fundamental to being a great product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:07">[12:57:07]</a>. This involves:
*   **Synthesis**: Distilling various opinions and complex information into a cohesive, actionable message, similar to literary commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:07">[13:15:07]</a>.
*   **Memorability (Mimification)**: Crafting insights and narratives that are easily remembered and shared throughout the company, driving action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:20">[15:20:20]</a>. To improve this, PMs should assume their audience has no context and build the story from scratch, using real-world metaphors to make complex ideas accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:20">[17:41:20]</a>.

When hiring product managers, Figma looks for strong storytelling and communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:51:00">[48:51:00]</a>. Key interview questions involve asking candidates to describe controversial product decisions or significant problems they've worked on, assessing their ability to frame conflict, represent multiple perspectives, and make the problem compelling to the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:02:00">[49:02:00]</a>. They also value PMs with "high bandwidth UX conversations," who can quickly navigate different levels of abstraction in problem-solving and anticipate outcomes of experiments or user studies to make efficient decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:12:00">[50:12:00]</a>.

## Growth Strategy

### [[figmas_unique_bottomup_go_to_market_strategy | Community-Led Growth]]

Figma is often cited as a model for product-led growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:52:00">[51:52:00]</a>. However, Yuki prefers to think of it as "community-led growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[52:50:00]</a>. The strategy focuses on empowering individuals within companies who are passionate about Figma to become internal advocates and evangelists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:07:00">[53:07:00]</a>. The sales team's role is to support these champions by providing data, stories, and connections to help them make a stronger case for wider adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:22:00">[53:22:00]</a>.

Early on, Figma focused intentionally on building a strong community. The ability for users to easily share Figma files, effectively "open-sourcing" their work, generated significant interest by allowing others to see how different companies operated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:16:00">[55:16:00]</a>. Programs like "Friends of Figma" foster human connections among passionate users in various geographies, further building loyalty and encouraging internal advocacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:40:00">[55:40:00]</a>.

### The Importance of "Love" for the Product

A critical element for successful product-led growth is eliciting an "irrational," emotional response of "love" for the product from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:01:00">[57:01:00]</a>. This love must first be cultivated authentically internally among employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:08:00">[57:08:00]</a>. Externally, users who love the product become passionate advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:15:00">[57:15:00]</a>.

Figma's philosophy of collaborative design, where "everyone can see what you're doing" and "multiple designers can be in the file at the same time," was initially controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:40:00">[57:40:00]</a>. Some designers reacted strongly, with one famously saying, "If this is a feature of design, I'm quitting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:52:00">[57:52:00]</a>. This "narrative tension" was a signal that Figma was driving a revolution and a new way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:00:00">[58:00:00]</a>. Equipping customers to champion not just a tool but "a new way of working" is a tall order, but essential for such passionate advocacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:17:00">[58:17:00]</a>.

## Outlook with Adobe Acquisition

Regarding the potential acquisition by Adobe, Figma aims to continue its mission of improving product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:35:00">[59:35:00]</a>. This could involve making the end-to-end product development process more seamless, especially given that many users currently juggle both Adobe tools and Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:59:00">[59:59:00]</a>. Collaboration with Adobe could also extend Figma's real-time multiplayer collaboration platform to a broader set of creative tools, potentially making complex creative work more accessible and shareable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.

What Figma hopes will not change is its deep relationship with its community and users, as this "proximity to community" is considered a core part of "the magic of how Figma works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.

## A "Work in Progress" Mindset

Yuki emphasizes that Figma, like all companies, is "far from perfect" and still constantly experimenting with its product processes and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. He highlights the concept of living in a "work in progress" world, where products, strategies, and even internal processes are subject to continuous change and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This open mindset encourages continuous learning and adaptation in the face of evolving challenges.

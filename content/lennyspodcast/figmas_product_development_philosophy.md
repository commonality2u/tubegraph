Figma's approach to product development is deeply rooted in transparency, collaboration, and an unwavering focus on the user. Yuki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, highlights several key philosophies that guide the company's product teams.

## The Role of Product Management
At Figma, Product Managers (PMs) are uniquely responsible for owning the "why" behind a product or idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This philosophy emerged from experiences where it became impossible to specify every detail for a large team, necessitating that designers and engineers make informed decisions on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Understanding the core problem being solved allows teams to scale effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

Figma employs the "five whys" technique, especially in post-mortems for engineering, to find the root cause of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. A PM can apply this by not just asking why a customer wants a feature, but why they have that underlying problem in the first place, potentially leading to a bigger product impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## Unwavering Proximity to Customers
A core obsession at Figma is maintaining close [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development | proximity to customers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>. This stems from Figma's origin, where co-founder Dylan Field consistently put early versions of the product in front of designers, incorporated their feedback, and fostered a community of evangelists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. This deep connection has shaped the product and drives its continued spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:07">[02:37:07]</a>.

The company actively engages with its community:
*   Teams often tweet out ideas or focus areas to gather direct feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>.
*   Dylan Field, the CEO, is known for reading the most customer feedback, even noticing tweets with zero likes that might signal a deeper truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:56">[02:54:56]</a>. A "concerning tweets" channel exists for internal teams to address these signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   It's crucial for PMs to balance insights from vocal minorities (e.g., social media) with broader data from support tickets, sales conversations, and research to avoid blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

## Internal Dogfooding and Accountability
Figma strongly emphasizes its teams using their own product, a practice known as dogfooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:18">[03:28:18]</a>. This ensures high quality because internal users naturally seek to improve their own workflows and derive satisfaction from enhancing the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. For example:
*   Figma PMs shifted from a "memo culture" to a "deck culture" to encourage building presentations directly within Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:07">[03:56:07]</a>.
*   Performance reviews and interview debriefs are conducted using templates in FigJam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:07">[03:17:07]</a>.

This internal usage fosters a sense of personal accountability among engineers and designers. When they experience a problem firsthand, or know that their customers are people they interact with in the community (e.g., on Twitter), they feel a stronger compulsion to fix it and deliver a product they're proud of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Figma allows for bottom-up energy, enabling developers to go off and fix issues they notice, as their intrinsic motivation often leads to faster and more effective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

## Experimentation and Learning
Figma embraces experimentation, acknowledging that not every feature or launch is a success. For instance, the "branching and merging" feature for design systems, though requested by customers, saw low initial adoption due to performance issues and being a foreign workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>. This highlighted the need to be more creative in understanding effectiveness, especially for features not used by the internal team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:50">[03:48:50]</a>.

### Evolution of OKRs
Figma's approach to OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) has evolved. Initially, OKRs felt "performative" or led to focus on secondary metrics that didn't truly impact the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:18">[04:02:18]</a>. They sometimes became a "to-do list" rather than motivating action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

Figma experimented with:
*   **Headline approach**: Focusing on understanding the philosophical goal rather than strict measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Commitments**: Using this terminology to encourage teams to take goals more seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

Yuki Yamashita's current philosophy for good OKRs emphasizes three qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>:
1.  **Legendary**: Clear and understandable without obfuscation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Actionability**: Inspires teams to act differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
3.  **Authenticity**: Honestly depicts what the team is trying to do daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

## [[figmas_go_to_market_strategy | Growth Strategy]]
Figma is a prime example of [[product_development_and_customer_fanaticism | product-led growth]], though Yamashita prefers the term "community-led growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. The strategy focuses on empowering individuals within companies who are passionate advocates for Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Figma equips these internal champions with data and stories to make a stronger case for wider adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

Key elements of Figma's growth:
*   **Building Community**: Fostering organic conversations about Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Shareable Files**: Enabling users to share their work, effectively "open-sourcing" their methods within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **Friends of Figma Program**: Organizing passionate users in various geographies into communities for evangelism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Connection**: Cultivating an "irrational emotional response" or "love" for the product, both internally and externally, which fuels advocacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Figma's controversial ideas, like multiple designers in the same file, challenged existing norms and created a "revolution" that users could champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

## Hiring Philosophy
In hiring Product Managers, Figma looks for strong [[the_importance_of_craft_and_values_in_product_development | storytelling and communication skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. A key interview question asks candidates to describe a time they were part of a controversial product decision, assessing their ability to frame conflicts, understand multiple perspectives, and compel others to care about a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. They also value PMs who can quickly navigate different "altitudes" of a problem, from high-level to detailed, and who can "fast forward to the future" to imagine outcomes and efficiently decide what *not* to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook (with Adobe)
While the potential acquisition by Adobe is not yet finalized, Figma anticipates exciting avenues for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>:
*   **Seamless Product Design Workflow**: Enhancing the end-to-end product development process by integrating with Adobe tools to create a single source of truth and eliminate app juggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Multiplayer Collaboration Platform**: Leveraging Figma's real-time multiplayer collaboration technology as a platform across Adobe's broader suite of creative tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

Figma intends to maintain its strong relationship with its community and users, viewing this proximity as a core part of its magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Constant Iteration
Yuki Yamashita emphasizes that Figma, like its products, is always a "work in progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. The processes for product management, such as goal setting and work reviews, are continually experimented with and refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. The company encourages a mindset that nothing is perfectly figured out, fostering continuous learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

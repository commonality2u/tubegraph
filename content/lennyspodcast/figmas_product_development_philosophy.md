From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Figma's product development philosophy is deeply rooted in customer proximity, a strong emphasis on the "why" behind product decisions, continuous experimentation, and a unique approach to fostering community-led growth. This philosophy shapes how the company builds its highly regarded software and manages its product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:49">[01:34:49]</a>.

## Core Philosophical Tenets

### The Power of Storytelling
A significant aspect of Figma's product philosophy, especially for product leaders, is the emphasis on [[Product Management Skill Development Framework | storytelling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Yuki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, considers it instrumental to success, often including it in performance reviews for product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>.

Storytelling for product managers involves:
*   **Synthesis:** Distilling disparate opinions, ideas, and problems into a cohesive message or thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This means understanding diverse perspectives and pushing a project forward from that synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a>.
*   **Driving Action & Memorability:** Crafting a narrative that is powerful enough to stick in people's minds and compel action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This includes making insights "memified" so they can be easily recalled and referenced by leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Escaping the Curse of Knowledge:** Explaining complex concepts from scratch, assuming no prior context for the audience, often drawing on real-world metaphors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

### Owning the "Why"
Figma's product managers are uniquely responsible for owning the "why" behind a product or idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. While the "what" and "how" are collaborative efforts, understanding the core problem and its root cause (using a "five whys" approach) is crucial for PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This approach allows teams to make great localized decisions even without explicit guidance on every detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

### Obsession with Proximity to Customers
Figma maintains an intense focus on staying close to its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This stems from [[Figmas early development and user acquisition | Figma's early development]], where co-founder Dylan Field constantly sought feedback from designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

Examples of this obsession include:
*   **Direct Engagement:** Team members tweeting out ideas or asking for feedback on specific features like prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Founder-led Feedback:** Dylan Field consistently reads customer feedback, even for minor, low-engagement tweets, believing they often contain an "essence of truth" indicating larger issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. A dedicated "concerning tweets" Slack channel was even created to manage this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **Balanced Feedback Sources:** While social media is useful, Figma also extracts insights from support tickets, sales conversations, and research to avoid blind spots and balance vocal minorities with broader user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

### Internal Product Usage (Dogfooding)
A key strategy for building high-quality software is encouraging the entire company to use Figma's products as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   Figma actively promotes using its tools for internal processes, such as product managers building decks in Figma instead of traditional memo writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   Teams use FigJam for performance reviews, interview debriefs, and product reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   This intense internal usage naturally leads to improvements as employees identify and fix issues to improve their own workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   It fosters a sense of "personal accountability" among builders who feel a direct relationship with the end-user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### Embracing Experimentation and Learning
Figma embraces experimentation, acknowledging that not every feature or launch will be a success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   They run numerous experiments that don't always yield winning results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   Features like "branching and merging" for design systems, despite significant investment and initial customer requests, didn't immediately see high adoption due to performance issues or being a "foreign workflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This highlighted the need for more creative ways to understand effectiveness for new types of customers when internal dogfooding is less applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Goal Setting (OKRs)

Figma has had an evolving and sometimes "love-hate" relationship with OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Initially, OKRs sometimes felt performative or led to focusing on secondary metrics that didn't truly matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

Yuki Yamashita has experimented with different approaches:
*   **Focus on "Headlines":** Temporarily deprecated traditional OKRs to encourage teams to focus on their philosophical goals and what they were "optimizing for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Reintroducing OKRs with Rigor:** With a stronger data science team, OKRs were reintroduced with more rigor around metrics, aiming for better alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
*   **Current Philosophy for Goals:** Regardless of the terminology, good goals (or OKRs) should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>:
    *   **Legendary:** Easy to understand and not an "obfuscated metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Actionable:** Inspire action and drive different behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Authentic:** Honestly depict the team's day-to-day work and intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

## [[Figmas approach to productled growth and community building | Product-Led and Community-Led Growth]]

Figma is often cited as a model for product-led growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. However, the company views it more as "community-led growth," where passionate users within companies become advocates and evangelists for Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

Key aspects include:
*   **Empowering Champions:** The sales team's role is to equip these internal "champions" with data and stories to make a stronger case for Figma's adoption within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Intentional Community Building:** From its early days, Figma intentionally fostered a strong community. The ability to easily share files and "open source" design work allows users to share "how we do it at XYZ company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **"Friends of Figma" Program:** This program connects passionate users in different geographies through Discord channels and regular meetings, further fueling evangelism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.
*   **Cultivating Love for the Product:** The ultimate goal is to evoke an "irrational," emotional response and "love" for the product, which then drives users to passionately advocate for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

> "It's not just that they're championing for a tool, they're also championing for like a new way of working." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>

This commitment to a "new way of working" and a product that inspires strong emotional connection, even if initially controversial (e.g., real-time collaboration), is a cornerstone of Figma's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

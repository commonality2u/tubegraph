At Linear, [[the_role_of_product_managers | product management]] is viewed partly as a go-to-market discipline, alongside sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>. This contrasts with the common view of [[the_role_of_product_managers | product management]] primarily interacting with engineering and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

## Collaborative Approach: The "Double Triangle"

Traditional organizational structures often show antagonism between product and sales/marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>. Linear emphasizes bringing the "building side" and the "selling side" of the organization together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>. This concept is visualized as a "double triangle," with the [[the_role_of_product_managers | Product Manager]] in the middle connecting engineering, product, and design with sales, marketing, and [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

### Product Marketing Integration
Linear's [[the_role_of_product_managers | Product Management]] team includes a full-time product marketer whose role is to craft the language for upcoming releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. This person is responsible for change logs and release notes, working directly with product teams to determine how to best communicate new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>.

### Sales Validation
The sales team validates the messaging and language in the field, providing crucial feedback on its effectiveness with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. This creates a strong feedback loop between product, marketing, and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

## Key Contributions of Product Management to Go-to-Market

*   **Native Language Expertise**: [[the_role_of_product_managers | Product Managers]] understand the customer at a deep level due to their involvement in requirements gathering and discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. This allows them to know the "native language" of the customer, which is vital for effective communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Message Origination**: Instead of just relying on marketing, [[the_role_of_product_managers | Product Managers]] should be involved in originating the message and picking the precise words and emphasis used in external communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
*   **Content Creation**: This includes contributing to product marketing content, such as website copy, headlines, and emails that customers see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.

> [!TIP] Opportunity for Impact
> For [[the_role_of_product_managers | Product Managers]] in B2B businesses, leaning into the sales and marketing (go-to-market) side of the role presents a significant opportunity to increase impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.

## Treating Deadlines as P0 Problems
Linear takes deadlines very seriously, especially those tied to external marketing initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. When a deadline is set, it becomes a "P0 problem," meaning nothing else should matter in comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

*   **No Engineer Diversions**: Engineers working on a P0 deadline are not pulled off for other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>.
*   **Scope Cutting**: The [[the_role_of_product_managers | Product Manager]]'s role is to cut as much scope as necessary to ensure the deadline is met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>. The goal is to deliver a workable product by the deadline, even if it doesn't include all desired features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>.
*   **Value of Marketing Opportunities**: Builders should recognize that missing a marketing communication opportunity (e.g., a monthly or quarterly launch) means that opportunity is lost forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.
*   **Minimal Estimation**: Instead of extensive estimation, Linear focuses on shipping early. By having a working solution 10% into the allocated time, the team can use the remaining time to iterate and polish for a shippable state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. This proactive approach allows the team to be in a position to confidently say yes or no to a launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

His philosophy revolves around maximizing impact by focusing on core principles and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Guiding Light for Product Managers

The core guiding light for any product manager (PM) is to wake up every day aiming to have the biggest impact possible for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. For leaders, this means striving to use their team to achieve the greatest impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This focus on impact should transcend concerns about politics, promotion, or organizational size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[Traits of Successful Product Managers | Attributes of Top 1% Product Managers]]

Ian McAllister's classic post, "What separates a top one percent PM from a top 10 percent PM," outlines key attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He emphasizes that no single PM excels at all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

The initial attributes identified include:
*   **Think Big** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
*   **Communicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
*   **Simplify** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>
*   **Prioritize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>
*   **Forecast and Measure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>
*   **Execute** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>
*   **Understand Technical Trade-offs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>
*   **Understand Good Design** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>
*   **Write Effective Copy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>

More recently, Ian added new attributes based on further reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>:
*   **Earn Trust with Others**: Seen as the "currency" of a product manager and leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Digging for Data**: Essential for all product roles, especially junior ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Pushing Back Effectively**: Correlates with ability to grow and succeed as a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Adapting to Change**: Impacts morale and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Driven by Impact (not Promotion)**: Focus on business results over career advancement naturally leads to promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## [[Improving product management skills | Tips for New Product Managers]]

For new PMs, the top three [[skills for modern product managers | skills]] to focus on are:

1.  **Communicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
    *   **Tactical Tip**: Grade yourself after communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Reflect on how you could have answered questions better, and ask your manager for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
    *   Avoid common pitfalls like rambling; learn to answer first, then explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Know how to use numbers effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
    *   This is a skill you'll work on throughout your entire product career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

2.  **Prioritize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
    *   Consider various dimensions of prioritization: themes, projects within themes, sequencing, and even time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
    *   A PM with great prioritization skills can generate 5x the impact of someone without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
    *   Working backwards from a fitness function or metric can guide prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

3.  **Execute** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
    *   Execution involves molding what you want to build into a simple, compact package with the highest possible impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
    *   It's a function of the team: designers, data scientists, and especially engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. A PM has ownership in helping the team improve and be well-resourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
    *   PMs are the "motive power" behind execution and impact; if a PM stalls, the project likely will too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

### What to Focus Less On (Initially)
While all attributes are important, new PMs can focus less on "thinking big," "understanding technical trade-offs," and "understanding good design" initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. These become more crucial as one gains seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. New PMs should aim to work on projects that are likely to have a lot of impact, even if they aren't responsible for setting the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. Choosing to work on something that drives the business (offense) can lead to more visibility and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

## [[Improving product management skills | Tips for Senior Product Managers]]

For senior PMs, the focus shifts to broader influence and strategic leadership:

1.  **Communicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>
    *   This remains paramount at every level, but the stakes are higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

2.  **Think Big** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>
    *   Senior PMs should constantly ask if an idea or solution could be bigger and more impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
    *   This means taking a wider view of what success looks like for your product, beyond just the typical product scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Think like a General Manager (GM) and consider anything that influences customer success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.
    *   An owner's mindset helps in finding and removing constraints or barriers to product success, regardless of function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.

3.  **Earn Trust** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>
    *   This becomes even more crucial in senior roles as it is the currency of a product leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.
    *   Trust is built by repeatedly setting and meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>. This includes being honest, launching what you promised, owning your mistakes, and forecasting goals and hitting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
    *   Losing trust occurs when one lies, is evasive, doesn't ship what was promised, or repeats mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
    *   It also involves understanding the goals of other people and their organizations and spending time to align and forge alliances, rather than just being bullheaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. A lack of true partnership with key stakeholders (e.g., customer support leadership) can hinder the execution of even a strong strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

4.  **Driven by Impact (not Promotion)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>
    *   This applies across all levels but is particularly important as a senior PM, as it's how leaders are evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
    *   Focusing on growing your business and maximizing impact naturally leads to career growth and promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

## The Amazon Way: Working Backwards Process

Ian spent 12 years at Amazon, a company known for its distinct product development approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Many Amazon employees stay for over 10 years due to the structured thinking, focus on metrics, and continuous learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.

### Lessons from Amazon Leadership
*   **Jeff Bezos**: Encouraging leader who emphasized the importance of a problem paragraph in a press release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. If there's no problem paragraph, there might not be a real problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. He also highlighted three criteria for investing in new ideas: Is it a big idea? Is it something Amazon should be doing? Is there a legitimate plan to succeed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>
*   **Jeff Wilkie**: The "consummate operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. He fostered an operational mindset and rigor throughout the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. The weekly Business Review (WBR) mechanism, led by Wilkie, instilled accountability and deep business knowledge across leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Wilkie practiced "tough love" and excelled at teaching the "why" behind decisions, which builds understanding and buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

### Common Mistakes in Implementing Working Backwards
The most common mistake when teams try to adopt the "working backwards" process is that they don't truly start with the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. Instead, they already have a solution in mind and then try to retrofit a problem and customer to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

Symptoms of not working backwards correctly include:
*   Starting conversations by discussing how different internal technologies or assets can be combined to create something new ("we could put these ingredients together and make a meal") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.
*   Focusing on the technology or components rather than a compelling customer problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.

### The Core of Working Backwards
Working backwards is fundamentally about obsessing over the problem and being guided by it to develop a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. The *mechanism* of the press release and FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) is a tool Amazon uses to *enforce* this mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.

#### The Working Backwards Mechanism (Press Release & FAQ)
*   The press release typically includes a problem paragraph, a solution paragraph, and a customer quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
*   The FAQ component ensures there is a legitimate plan to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>. It forces consideration of internal components, finances, and key technical hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.
*   **Working Backwards Reviews** are meetings where leadership reviews these documents to understand the concept, ask questions, and potentially approve the initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

### When to Use Working Backwards
This process is most effective for significant initiatives or new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. While there might be a scale below which it doesn't make sense due to overhead, the *spirit* of working backwards from the customer problem is always valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.

## General Advice for Product Managers

*   **Writing Online**: Summarizing your thoughts in writing can be a powerful way to clarify your own thinking and gain a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. It can lead to unexpected career opportunities and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Business writing helps develop clear thinking and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement**: Cultivate a mindset of self-reflection and always consider how you could have performed better in any interaction or project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. This muscle can be built over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.
*   **Learning from Others**: Be a "sponge" and learn from smart, driven people, especially leaders. Observing how they run meetings, ask questions, and approach problem-solving can greatly propel your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **[[Challenges and opportunities of being a product manager | Adapting to Company Culture]]**: While the "working backwards" philosophy is universally valuable, the specific mechanisms for product development may vary by company (e.g., slide culture vs. document culture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. PMs must acknowledge their environment and adapt their approach, recognizing they have more leverage with their team than with senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>.

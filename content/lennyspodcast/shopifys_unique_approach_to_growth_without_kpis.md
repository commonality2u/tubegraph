Shopify, a significant player in the e-commerce landscape, accounts for approximately 10% of e-commerce in the United States, processing around $235 billion in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) globally in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:10">[03:11:10]</a>. Despite its massive scale, Shopify employs highly unconventional methods for product development and [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | growth strategies]], particularly regarding performance measurement and organizational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>.

## The 100-Year Vision and Taste-Driven Product Development

Shopify's CEO, Toby, drives a "100-year vision" that shapes the company's priorities and product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. This long-term outlook emphasizes building a platform that can adapt and remain valuable for decades, rather than chasing short-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>.

A cornerstone of this philosophy is the unconventional approach to metrics within core product teams:
*   **KPIs and OKRs are "banned"** for core product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
*   Decisions are primarily based on "taste and intuition" and conviction that a technical foundation is right for the future of commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
*   While data is used, it's not the "overwriting" factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   This approach can lead to subjective conversations but allows for more risk-taking and the development of impactful features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   Quality and taste are centrally maintained by key leaders, ensuring consistency even without rigid metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. Every project must be approved by group leads, ensuring a consistent quality bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.
*   The "how" (technical architecture) is considered more crucial than the "what" or "who" is being built for, as it determines long-term strategy and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Unique Growth Strategy: Optimizing for Churn

Unlike most companies that focus on reducing churn and increasing retention, Shopify's growth team optimizes for churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This strategy is rooted in Shopify's mission to increase entrepreneurship on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>:
*   **Lowering Barriers to Entry**: Shopify aims to make it as easy as possible for anyone to start an online store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Power Law Monetization**: While many new businesses fail, the few that succeed and become large businesses (e.g., Allbirds, Figs) generate substantial revenue through payment processing (which is tied to merchant success) and other services, making the entire cohort profitable for Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This is likened to angel investing, where a few major wins cover many smaller losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Absolute Numbers vs. Rates**: Instead of optimizing for conversion *rates* (e.g., sign-up to activation rate), teams are incentivized to focus on the *absolute number* of people who complete a stage of the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This prevents teams from artificially inflating their conversion rates by making preceding steps harder, ensuring more people enter the funnel overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Metrics and Experimentation at Shopify

### Long-Term Holdouts for Experiments
Shopify utilizes a robust experimentation system that includes "long-term holdouts" to assess the true impact of changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>:
*   Experiments are continuously monitored a year, two years, or even three years later to observe their impact on long-term GMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   About 30-40% of experiments that show a short-term lift in metrics (e.g., paying shops, first sales) show "no incremental lift on GMV" a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This often occurs because the short-term lift merely pulls forward success that would have happened anyway, or the incremental users are not very valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Example: Payment Failure Notifications**: Improving alerts for failed credit card payments led to a short-term lift in payment success but showed "no long-term lift" in GMV because the users who let payments fail were less dedicated entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
*   Conversely, some experiments that show *neutral* short-term effects can have a "pretty massive impact" long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Example: Pre-filled Online Store Sections**: Providing pre-configured sections in the online store editor showed no immediate lift in conversion to a paying merchant but had a significant long-term impact on GMV. This is because it helped users create better, higher-converting stores, leading to earlier sales and sustained engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   Shopify's system automatically notifies experimenters of updated long-term results at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, fostering accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   This allows Shopify to ship quickly based on short-term indicators but then refine its understanding of truly impactful changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### Key Growth Levers
*   **Monetary Friction**: Reducing monetary friction (e.g., trial dynamics, trial length, incentives, price points) can unlock new segments of valuable merchants who might otherwise have given up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
*   **Onboarding Personalization**: Nailing the sign-up and onboarding flows by collecting the right information to personalize guidance is a consistent driver of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## [[shopifys_organizational_structure_and_team_dynamics | Organizational Structure]]

Shopify's product organization is structured into three major groups, each with different time horizons:
1.  **Core Product**: Focuses on the "100-year vision," building fundamental elements for the future of commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
2.  **Merchant Services**: Builds tools like payments and shipping, focusing on a shorter to medium-term horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
3.  **Growth**: Manages the end-to-end customer journey, focusing on bringing in and ensuring merchant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

Within growth, there are two main groups:
*   **Growth R&D**: Comprises traditional product, design, engineering, and data teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. It has three pillars:
    *   **Growth Product**: Handles landing pages, sign-up, onboarding, monetization, and merchant engagement to help entrepreneurs succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Platform/Tools ("Ad pillar")**: Builds internal tools like the experimentation platform, communication platform, and business intelligence tooling for both growth and other Shopify teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Customer Support Group**: Sits within growth, focusing on building tools and experiences to support merchants throughout their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Marketing**: Manages traditional channels like paid acquisition, media buying, affiliate marketing, email, content, and SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### [[Marketing_strategies_and_growth | Marketing Structure]]
Shopify does not have a CMO; instead, marketing functions are embedded across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. This allows marketing teams to be closer to their primary goals and move faster with less coordination, but can lead to "messy" organizational dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. The cohesive brand story is held by Toby and President Harley, who have strong intuition and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

### Collaboration and Sales Integration
Growth and Core Product teams, despite their differing approaches, maintain a strong partnership based on mutual respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Growth teams can touch any part of the product, and conflicts are resolved through discussion and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

Shopify has also integrated a sales motion, shifting from a purely [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth strategy]]. This has led to learnings regarding:
*   **Qualitative Insights**: Reliance on more qualitative data and empathy-building with sales and merchant success teams to understand challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Journeys**: Breaking down distinct "sales" and "self-service" funnels to create hybrid customer journeys, allowing merchants to choose their preferred path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This has required significant re-instrumentation of metrics and attribution models to avoid suboptimal investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Incrementality Measurement**: Shifting focus from multi-touch attribution to incrementality testing to understand causal impact across various channels and outcomes (self-service to sales, sales-specific) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Lessons from Discounting (from Udemy experience)

Archie Abrams' prior experience at Udemy highlighted the power of discounting as a growth lever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>:
*   **Signaling Value**: Discounting can signal high value with a high list price, then make the product affordable, appealing to a broader audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Job to Be Done**: In education, the "job to be done" isn't always completing the course, but often the emotional feeling of making progress. Purchasing a discounted course with urgency taps into this aspiration, encouraging repeated purchases and fostering retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Shopify's unique approach to growth, driven by a long-term vision and an emphasis on absolute numbers over rates, allows it to take significant risks and invest in foundational product quality. While this model relies heavily on the intuition and "taste" of its leadership, it has enabled Shopify to become a dominant force in e-commerce, consistently delivering value to its vast merchant base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Companies considering a similar path without traditional metrics need either strong metrics for accountability or an "opinionated founder" with "extremely strong opinions on what good is and what taste is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

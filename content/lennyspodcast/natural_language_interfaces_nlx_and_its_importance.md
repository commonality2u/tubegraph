Natural Language Interfaces (NLX) is an acronym coined by Aparna Shanapraada, Chief Product Officer at Microsoft, to describe "Natural Language UX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. Shanapraada states that [[AI interfaces and future trends in software development | NLX is the new UX]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## Why NLX is the New UX
Traditionally, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have been explicitly designed due to their unnatural and rigid nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. However, conversational interfaces and natural language offer a much more elastic interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. This elasticity does not mean that design is unnecessary; a common misconception among product builders is that with AI, "the model eats the product," and interaction is merely a chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

Conversations themselves possess grammars, structures, and invisible UI elements, akin to a podcast or a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. Therefore, understanding and designing these new principles and constructs in natural language as an interface is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

## Key Constructs in NLX Design
Several new design constructs are emerging, particularly for [[AI interfaces and future trends in software development | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>:

*   **Prompting**
    The prompt itself is a new UI element, similar to a traditional dropdown or menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

*   **Plans**
    When a high-level goal is given, an agent responding with a plan (preferably editable) represents a new and effective construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

*   **Showing the Work (Progress)**
    Products like Co-pilot and DeepC demonstrate the concept of "thinking aloud" or showing the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Designers must balance verbosity (avoiding a "crown job and scripts" feel) with terseness (ensuring users know the path and maintain confidence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. This transparency is especially valuable when AI models are perceived as black boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

*   **Follow-ups**
    Proactively suggesting logical follow-up actions after a user interaction is another critical design element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Too many suggestions can be annoying, while too few miss an opportunity to guide the user towards a successful outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

## Impact on Product Development
The field of NLX offers a "fun new space" for product builders and designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. Designing these seemingly simple conversations requires significant thought regarding how much information to share and how to guide the user through the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. As [[AI interfaces and future trends in software development | AI]] models rapidly advance, product builders need to [[understanding_and_identifying_user_needs | update their priors]] and expect more from AI today, moving past scar tissue from previous limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

Ultimately, Shanapraada expresses excitement about [[humanai_collaboration_in_product_development | human-AI collaboration]], envisioning a co-working space where humans and agents work together to achieve significantly greater output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>. This involves reimagining experiences where agents can mediate information flow and take on delegated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>. The current single-player experiences need to evolve into more collaborative environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>.

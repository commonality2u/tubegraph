Developing products with [[AI in product management | AI]] presents unique challenges and opportunities compared to traditional product development. Unlike building on a fixed technology base, [[AI in product management | AI]] product development involves a constantly evolving technological landscape where computers gain new capabilities every few months [00:01:46]. This rapid change necessitates continuous adaptation and reconsideration of how these new capabilities can transform existing products [00:02:02].

## Challenges in AI Product Development
The role of an [[AI product management and its future | AI]] product manager can be "sleepless" and challenging [00:01:32]. A significant hurdle is the inherent uncertainty regarding a model's capabilities. It's often unknown if a new model will perform at 60%, 90%, or 99% accuracy, and the product design must drastically differ based on these varying levels of reliability [00:06:55]. Even research teams may not fully predict outcomes, leading to a "stochastic" process [00:07:29]. Furthermore, internal advancements can disrupt existing product roadmaps, creating unexpected internal disruption [00:07:51].

## Planning and Iteration Cycles
Despite the unpredictable nature, some aspects of [[AI in Product Development | AI product development]] allow for planning. The progression of [[AI in Product Development | AI]] intelligence often follows a discernible slope, enabling some anticipation of future capabilities [00:08:20]. A key approach involves investing in specific capabilities through a "co-design, co-research, co-finetune" process with research teams [00:08:47]. This collaborative effort can lead to the development of features like "artifacts" or "canvas" [00:08:42]. Interestingly, new capabilities can sometimes emerge and exist for months before product teams realize their potential importance [00:09:47].

## Designing for Imperfect Models
A crucial aspect of [[AI in Product Development | AI product development]] is designing for models that might only be 60% successful at a given task [00:10:50]. Many valuable applications can still be built by anticipating and designing around these limitations. This often requires a human-in-the-loop, where human oversight and intervention are expected [00:10:56]. GitHub Copilot serves as an example: even an imperfect model was economically valuable because it significantly reduced manual effort, allowing users to edit and refine the generated code [00:11:02]. For longer-form tasks and agents, even minor time savings (e.g., 5-10 minutes) can be valuable [00:11:54]. Models that can identify their own lack of confidence and prompt for human assistance can achieve combined human-model performance much higher than their individual accuracy [00:11:57]. It's also important to note that a model's performance can be "lumpy," excelling at some tasks while struggling with others [00:12:21]. Real-world deployments often reveal unexpected variations in performance due to custom data, internal use cases, and specific prompting techniques [00:12:42].

## The Importance of Evaluation (Evals)
A critical insight is that many [[developing_ai_products_and_utilizing_technology | AI models]] are not "intelligence limited" but rather "eval limited" [00:13:13]. This means they possess more capabilities than are currently being effectively utilized or measured. Effectively evaluating model performance is paramount for [[developing_ai_products_and_utilizing_technology | AI product development]] and involves defining clear success metrics [00:13:47]. Often, [[AI in Product Development | AI]] itself can assist in writing and grading evaluations, automating a significant part of the process [00:14:01].

## Evals as a Core PM Skill
Writing effective evaluations is becoming a core skill for product managers [00:14:38]. The job of a PM in 2024-2025, when building [[ai_powered_product_management_skills | AI-powered features]], increasingly resembles that of research PMs who focus on model capabilities and development [00:15:00]. The quality of a feature is directly tied to the quality of its evaluations and prompts [00:15:20]. Learning to write good evals can be facilitated by using the models themselves to generate sample evaluations [00:16:06]. Additionally, nothing beats examining raw data and looking at the actual answers generated by the models to build intuition [00:16:27]. This "getting deep on the data" approach can reveal that perceived model failures might actually stem from flawed evaluators [00:17:03]. As models evolve to handle more ambiguous, long-form, and agentic tasks, evaluations will need to become more nuanced, moving from simple right/wrong assessments to more qualitative "performance reviews" of the model's behavior [00:17:19].

## Prototyping and Technical Depth
[[Prototyping with AI Tools | Prototyping with AI tools]] is an underused skill that can significantly accelerate the product development process [00:19:05]. Product managers can use models to quickly generate and compare different UI concepts, allowing for faster evaluation and a wider variety of prototypes [00:19:27].

Furthermore, [[ai_powered_product_management_skills | AI product management]] requires product managers to delve deeper into the technical stack [00:19:49]. While not every PM needs to be a researcher, understanding the language and gaining intuition for how the underlying technology works is essential [00:20:17].

## Adapting to Non-Deterministic Systems
[[AI in product management | AI]] introduces a non-deterministic nature to user interfaces [00:20:24]. Unlike traditional software where the same inputs yield the same outputs, [[developing_ai_products_and_utilizing_technology | AI]] models can produce varied results [00:21:32]. This requires new product design considerations, including implementing feedback mechanisms to quickly identify when a model has gone astray [00:20:35]. The challenge lies in understanding aggregate model behavior across numerous outputs and users [00:20:47]. Both product developers and end-users are still adapting to this paradigm shift, which counters decades of intuition built on deterministic computing [00:21:09].

## Educating End Users
Despite the unintuitive nature, people adapt remarkably quickly to [[developing_ai_products_and_utilizing_technology | AI]] advancements. Experiences like Waymo autonomous rides quickly transition from magical to commonplace [00:23:13]. Similarly, large language models like ChatGPT, while initially mind-blowing, quickly become the expected standard, making older versions seem "dumb" [00:24:03]. Companies are also learning to make products more educational, with models like Claude able to explain their features and guide users through processes, essentially solving UI and user confusion problems within the product itself [00:25:01].

In enterprise settings, where many users may be non-technical, the education process can involve structured sessions and educational materials [00:26:30]. Power users within organizations often become evangelists, leveraging tools like custom GPTs to make [[AI in Product Development | AI]] more accessible and immediately valuable for others [00:26:50].

## Future Trends in AI Product Development
Looking ahead, key trends in [[AI in Product Development | AI product development]] include:
*   **Proactivity:** Models will become more proactive, monitoring user information (with authorization) to spot trends, prepare for meetings, or draft presentations [00:33:50].
*   **Asynchronous Interaction:** Models like "o1" will handle longer, more complex tasks asynchronously, allowing users to initiate a task and return later for the completed result, breaking free from the expectation of immediate answers [00:34:21]. This enables models to tackle mini-projects, fix bugs, or adapt documents based on new conditions [00:35:05].
*   **Multimodal Interaction:** Models will interact more like humans, moving beyond text input to include speech and vision [00:35:40]. Advanced voice modes can act as universal translators, facilitating real-time conversations across language barriers [00:35:57]. This will impact areas like travel, making new places more accessible [00:36:36]. Young, "AI native" users are already interacting with voice modes in novel, intuitive ways [00:37:09].
*   **Personalization and Personality:** The "personality" and "behavior" of [[AI in Product Development | AI models]] will become crucial product considerations [00:39:43]. Models might customize their personalities or maintain distinct ones, influencing user preference [00:39:50]. Users are beginning to form nuanced relationships with models, perceiving them almost as entities [00:38:57].

These advancements suggest a future where [[AI in Product Development | AI]] is not just a tool but an intelligent, adaptable partner, continually evolving to meet complex needs.

Candor is a foundational element within Netflix's unique culture, inextricably linked with other core principles such as high talent density, learning, seeking excellence and improvement, and freedom and responsibility. Without high talent density, other aspects of the culture, including candor, cannot truly thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This approach reflects Reed Hastings' original belief that a company could be built differently, where people would thrive and find fulfillment through excellence and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This requires individuals to hold themselves to standards that don't always feel like natural human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Giving Feedback Effectively

Elizabeth Stone, Netflix's Chief Technology Officer, emphasizes that effective feedback is not about working long hours, but about a deep commitment to excellence and enabling team success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Her approach to giving feedback involves several key components:

*   **Setting Expectations and Standards** Managers must make expectations clear, holding themselves to the same high standards they expect from their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Elizabeth strives to avoid situations where others are waiting on her, demonstrating responsiveness and follow-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. The focus is on achieving the desired outcome through thoughtfulness and iteration, rather than excessive "polish" that may not serve the core objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Specific Feedback** When work doesn't meet the expected standard, managers should provide direct and specific feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **Helping to Fill the Gap** Crucially, feedback should be accompanied by support to help individuals improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. Elizabeth advocates for "jumping in with both feet" to work on something together, which helps uplevel the team and fosters a sense of psychological safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.
*   **Private Delivery** Feedback is best delivered in a private, safer space, rather than during a public meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. This approach ensures the feedback is absorbed without feeling "on a stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.

## Receiving Feedback and the "Keeper Test"

To maintain a high bar, individuals must also be willing to receive feedback themselves for continuous [[career_growth_and_personal_development | growth and improvement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.

### The Keeper Test

Netflix utilizes the "keeper test" as a mental framework for managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. This involves asking: "If this person on my team came to me and said, 'I'm leaving today, I have a different opportunity and I would like to take it,' would I do everything I could to keep them at Netflix?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. If the answer is no, it's an indication that a tough conversation about their suitability for the role or the company is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. This reflection encourages managers to act even when it's uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.

The goal is that such conversations are not a surprise, which requires ongoing feedback being provided along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. Many employees at Netflix frequently ask their managers, "Am I passing your keeper test?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. While the concept might seem heavy, it creates an avenue for regular, candid discussions about performance and expectations, rather than waiting for formal reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

### Absence of Formal Performance Reviews

Netflix does not have a practice of formal performance reviews or ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. Instead, they rely on ongoing, real-time feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. While there is an annual 360-degree feedback cycle where individuals request and receive feedback from many people, it's solely for the value of the feedback itself, not as an input to a formal output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. Performance is considered as part of promotions and compensation, but this necessitates that feedback is embedded into the day-to-day operating rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

### Managing Stress and Worry

A culture with such high expectations and frequent feedback might lead to worry or a "Hunger Games" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. However, Elizabeth finds that having these conversations openly reduces stress compared to not knowing how one is performing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. Knowing the expectations are high, but also receiving concrete feedback on areas for improvement, can alleviate anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>. High-performing individuals generally want to work with other high-performing individuals, and maintaining a high bar helps attract and retain the best talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. Gaps in skill sets or behavior can be toxic for teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

## Transparency and Candor in Leadership

Transparency is a core tenet, encapsulated by the phrase "context, not control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. Leaders like Elizabeth share information freely, taking notes in leadership meetings and distributing them to the entire organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. This includes candid reflections on challenges or problems that need solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

A notable example of candor in leadership was the introduction of Individual Contributor (IC) levels two years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>. Previously, all engineers and data scientists were simply "senior," without a leveling system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. While this non-structured environment was initially attractive to many, the growth and scale of the organization necessitated a language for team composition (e.g., distinguishing between new grads and those with 30 years of experience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>. The introduction of IC levels was a significant shift, and a candid "postmortem" was held to discuss what went well and what didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. This willingness to openly discuss imperfections and areas for improvement, rather than pretending everything went smoothly, helps build a sense of community and trust within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>.

A great strategy involves making difficult promises and then keeping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. For product people, four critical choices determine the product you build and the life you live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:28">[02:26:28]</a>. These choices are often glossed over, leading to a sacrifice of agency over the most important aspects of a product's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## The Four Choices of Strategy

### 1. Choose Your Customers

Picking your customers is fundamental because it dictates everything that will go into the product and what your future will be like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:23">[02:39:23]</a>. If the model is to be "for anyone," hoping to win through SEO, success is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Instead, focus on choosing your "smallest viable audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This involves considering:
*   Their language and financial capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   The problem they are trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   Their technical facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   Whether they are short-tempered or kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   Their likelihood to stick with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

Choosing your customers also means deciding who you are *not* for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. For example, a product like Humane's pin made a mistake by trying to appeal to customers expecting a finished Apple-quality product when it wasn't ready. Conversely, targeting "Raspberry Pi" enthusiasts on platforms like Product Hunt allows for a different dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Similarly, being a wedding photographer in the Hamptons means preparing to deal with specific client temperaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### 2. Choose Your Competition

The choice of competition significantly impacts your strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Operating in a space means building an "enormous set of boundaries" around what you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. If you compete against a company like Walmart, you should expect them to continually lower prices, as that is their established practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### 3. Choose the Source of Validation

The source of validation for your product is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Instead of primarily trying to please your boss, the goal should be to match the taste of the agreed-upon customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Having a difficult, upfront conversation with your boss to align on customer taste as the primary metric can improve subsequent meetings and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### 4. Choose Your Distribution

Distribution strategy is vital, especially in the software business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. The choice of distribution channel can entirely change the nature of your product. For example, video games sold in mass merchants faced different competitive landscapes than those sold in computer stores or via direct download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. The emergence of platforms like Steam or downloadable shareware transforms everything about how a product is built and accessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. It's imperative to decide on distribution early in the process, even before turning the page on your business plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

These four choices are interconnected and are not easily changeable at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Glossing over them often stems from fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## The Role of Tension in Strategy

A great strategy inherently possesses tension at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Tension, distinct from stress, is fundamental to every art form and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. It represents the possibility of something not working, creating anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. When a new product is launched with a promise, the user imagines a better life if that promise holds true. This creates tension: *Did you tell the truth? Will it work for them?* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Products and brands that make a promise must deliver on it to build trust and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Being Remarkable

One of the most effective ways to succeed is through word-of-mouth marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This requires making something [[Purple Cow | remarkable]], meaning it is "worth making a remark about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. It's not about viral videos or gimmickry, but about creating a product that genuinely improves a user's life and makes them want to talk about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. If a product is designed so that users benefit from sharing it with others, the marketing problem is largely solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## Understanding the System

To be a [[Strategies for effective decisionmaking | strategic thinker]], one must "see the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Systems are pervasive and often invisible, yet they dictate how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. While systems serve valuable functions for interoperability, they can also become self-reinforcing and toxic, inventing "culture" or "the way things are around here" to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

If something feels scary to do, it's often because the system wants you to perceive it that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. A [[Key elements of a successful strategy | strategic approach]] involves understanding which system will be offended by a particular action and deciding whether to work within it or leverage your position to change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. For example, early downloadable software was seen as risky due to piracy concerns by the dominant distribution system, but experimenting with it was essential for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

### Better Waves Make Better Surfers

This metaphor suggests that success is often less about individual skill and more about choosing the right "wave" or environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Great surfers pass up mediocre waves, waiting for the one they know they can surf best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Similarly, in business, selecting the right company, the right key roles, and being willing to wait for superstar talent can be more impactful than rushing to meet imaginary deadlines with mediocre work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. To avoid mediocrity, one must do something different from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Leadership and Empathy

[[The Importance of Strategy and DecisionMaking in Product Leadership | Leadership]] is about doing what you believe, painting a picture of the future, and having people follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. However, this "picture of the future" must be grounded in empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Leaders should paint a picture of where *they* want to go, not where the leader wants to go. This non-narcissistic approach means being of service and opening the door for people to achieve their existing desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. It is challenging to change what people want, but highly effective to offer a path for them to get where they already intend to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

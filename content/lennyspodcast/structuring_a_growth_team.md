Melton Coron Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, shares insights into how their growth team was structured and evolved, emphasizing the importance of foundational elements and key hiring characteristics. Deel is noted for its extraordinary growth, going from zero to $300 million in revenue in three years while remaining EBITDA positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>.

## Early Growth Team Structure at Deel

In the early days, when Melton was the second hire to the marketing team and employee number 19 or 20 overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:02">[05:54:02]</a>, the focus was on building the skeleton before adding the "makeup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The initial approach to [[building_and_managing_a_successful_tech_team | team building]] was to bring in one leader for a specific organizational part and then allow them to grow their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. This avoided hiring based on untested hypotheses, which can lead to layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.

The first key hires for the growth team included:
*   **Product Marketing Person** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>: This individual served as the bridge between the product team and go-to-market teams, setting the messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.
*   **Talented Copywriter** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>: Hired to help set the messaging and tone, this person now leads the creative teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.
*   **Data Analyst** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>: A data analyst was hired as the third person on the growth team because the sentiment was not to spend a dollar without knowing its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. While some might consider a data hire too early as number three, Melton believes it was the right decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

The content person was already at Deel when Melton joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.

## Evolving to Functional and Regional Teams

As Deel grew, the team structure evolved to include both functional and regional teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>:

*   **Functional Teams** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>: These teams comprise subject matter experts whose location is not a concern. Examples include product marketing, content, community, events, paid advertisements, and brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. The belief is that keeping technical roles together fosters faster learning and skill development, leading to better best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   **Regional Teams** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>: Since Deel sells into many different regions, local expertise is crucial. Marketing managers for key regions work with the functional teams to execute strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.

This structure allows a regional manager, for example, to work with the central paid ads team to run campaigns in Turkey, defining the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. The decision for time allocation across regions depends on factors like total addressable market, opportunities, and competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.

## Key Characteristics for Early Growth Team Hires

When [[hiring_and_developing_growth_leaders | hiring growth leaders]] and team members, certain characteristics are prioritized:

*   **Commitment to Bottom-Line KPIs**: Candidates should be willing to commit to closed-won revenue KPIs, not just lead numbers, to show they care about the business's bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. This can be assessed by asking about past committed KPIs and their thoughts on what KPIs they *should* have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.
*   **Willingness to do "Dirty Work"**: Deel operates with a concept called "little hands," meaning everyone, regardless of position, must be willing to get involved in the nitty-gritty work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. This checks for adaptability and comfort operating with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.
*   **Operating with Limited Resources**: When hiring from larger companies, it's crucial to assess if candidates are accustomed to operating with a fraction of the resources they previously had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>. A good test is to ask candidates to develop strategies for zero, ten thousand, and one hundred thousand dollars in budget, observing their willingness to commit to bottom-of-funnel metrics without extensive resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

The growth team at Deel is specifically called "growth" instead of "marketing" because they prioritize revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. Leads and SQLs are tracked as leading indicators, but conversion to paying clients and revenue generated are the ultimate measures of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.

## The Importance of Product in Growth

A strong product is fundamental to successful growth efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>. Acquisition channels will not be effective if the product doesn't meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

> "You can be the best marketer in the world if when people come to your product, even if your sales team does a good job at convincing them to become a customer... if the product doesn't live up to the expectations... they're gonna leave." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>

When considering joining an early-stage company, it's advisable to look at the team breakdown. At Deel, most of the team consisted of product and engineers when Melton joined, indicating a solid business core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. If an early-stage company has six sales people and two engineers, the product's quality might not be sustainable for long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

### Problem-Solving and Strategic Thinking
*   **Question**: A hypothetical scenario where "a group of scientists have invented a teleportation device," and the candidate's role is to bring it to market. The catch: they can only ask two questions to the scientists before developing a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. (Shishir Mehrotra, CEO and Co-founder of Coda)
    *   **What interviewers look for**: This question assesses a candidate's ability to identify "important guiding (IG) questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. It reveals their capacity to simplify complex problems and focus on the most critical information needed to strategize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   **Example of good questions**: "Is it safe enough for humans?" and "Is it more expensive capex or Opex?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>

    *   **What interviewers look for**: Candidates should be able to clearly set up the conflict, demonstrate an understanding of both sides, show an ability to take on different perspectives, and do so in an even-keeled manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This question also evaluates storytelling and communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Pride in Work and Values Alignment
*   **Question**: "Tell me what work you are most proud of." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> (Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe; Ki Sarin, CEO of Linear; Camille Hurst, Product Leader at Spotify)
    *   **What interviewers look for**: This question helps interviewers understand a candidate's taste, judgment, motivations, what they value, and what "good" looks like to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. It provides insight into what truly drives them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

    *   **What interviewers look for**: Product Management roles are inherently ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Good answers demonstrate the ability to create structure and a path forward through ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Interviewers also look for candidates who seek help and inputs, rather than assuming their initial path is always correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, and who establish milestones to evaluate effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

It reveals what the candidate learned, how they learned it, how it works, and how they apply it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Question**: "What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> (Nikhil Singal, VP of Product at Facebook)
    *   **What interviewers look for**: This question is designed to break the "interview mindset" where candidates try to predict what the interviewer wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. It's a "save question" to test for authenticity and genuine opinions, ensuring high-quality candidates aren't dismissed for lacking novelty in their prepared answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

    *   **What interviewers look for**: Good product managers ask "why" constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Interviewers will try to discern this trait throughout the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### Alignment of Values
*   **Question (for the interviewer, from the candidate)**: "Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> (Candidate asking Ben Williams)
    *   **Why it's brilliant**: This question allows candidates to test alignment of their personal values with those of the person they'd be working with closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

### Sincerity and Family Dynamics

An answer that acknowledges imperfections or "weird things" about them can demonstrate humbleness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

### Learning from Failure
*   **Question**: "Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> (Paige Castello, Co-Head of Product Management at Asana)
    *   **What interviewers look for**: This question reveals a candidate's mindset and how they discuss and evaluate situations when products fail or team dynamics are challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. It's a great way to understand how people think and perceive themselves when things are not working well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Related Questions**: "Tell me something you did that worked out but not for the reason that you thought it would work" or "tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a> (Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health)

### Self-Limitation and Humility

    *   **What interviewers look for**: This tests introspection and whether a person can be open and introspective when they hit their limits or struggle, rather than blaming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.
*   **Related Question**: "Do you consider yourself lucky?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>
    *   **What interviewers look for**: This question is fascinating as it reveals whether individuals are comfortable admitting luck or if insecurity prevents them from doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Acknowledging luck often indicates comfort and humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Defining Impact and Motivation
*   **Question**: "Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a> (Lauren Isford, Head of Growth at Notion)
    *   **What interviewers look for**: This helps understand how candidates define "impact" and what it means to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. For growth practitioners, a good answer showcases intrinsic motivation for impacting the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

## Reference Calls (Post-Interview)
*   **Question for Referees**: "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a> (Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer at Intercom)
    *   **Why it's effective**: This question is effective because referees cannot dodge it, providing incredibly honest insights into potential areas for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. This is part of the broader [[hiring_practices_and_work_trials | hiring practices]] process and helps evaluate a candidate post-interview.

During the pandemic, many companies significantly [[overcoming_hiring_challenges_in_tech_startups | overhired]], often lowering their hiring bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This led to an abundance of "ridiculous roles" within organizations, such as agile coaches, product owners, product operations, and business analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These individuals are often seen as "product management theater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, dramatically overpaid for the value they provide, as their roles are often more aligned with project management rather than true product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Macro Factors Contributing to the Current Landscape

Several converging factors contribute to the challenges stemming from overhiring:
*   **Financial Market Changes** An increase in the cost of funds has created a new financial reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Generative AI's Predicted Impact** The anticipated disruptive influence of generative AI creates uncertainty among leaders and is expected to have a very real, though uncertain, impact on roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Team Size Out of Hand** Especially outside of Silicon Valley, team sizes have grown excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. There's a growing appreciation that smaller, more focused teams often yield better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   **Remote Work** The shift to remote work has impacted both velocity and innovation in many companies, causing them to struggle with maintaining the level of innovation they once achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Investment in "Extra Roles"** Outside the Silicon Valley bubble, large companies have invested heavily in roles like agile coaches, Scrum Masters, various types of project managers, and "assistant product manager types" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This has led to "epic waste" where better companies achieve more with significantly less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Process-Heavy Approaches** Many organizations, particularly outside of Silicon Valley, mistakenly believe that processes, such as SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework), are the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This often results in little to show in terms of outcomes despite significant costs and waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

Companies are now reacting to these issues, with some realizing that their approach to building products and serving customers needs a hard look, ideally by observing how leading companies operate with less proportional spend and greater returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## The Problem with "Product Management Theater"

A significant issue is the prevalence of "product management theater" where individuals carry the title of product manager but are not performing the core duties of the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. This often means they are essentially project managers, focusing on delivering output (features) rather than achieving outcomes (solving customer or business problems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

This phenomenon is particularly apparent in "feature teams," where product managers are given a roadmap of features to design, build, test, and deploy, often with strict deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. In such environments, product managers are often "dramatically overpaid for the value they provide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>, as their role is primarily project management, which could often be covered by engineers or designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. This leads to a general skepticism or "dislike" of product managers in many places, as their experience is often with ineffective PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

There is a stark contrast between a "feature team product manager" and an "empowered product team" where product managers are responsible for solving customer and business problems, measuring success by outcomes, not just shipping products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. In an empowered product team, the product manager is a "creator," not merely a facilitator, working collaboratively with design and engineering to develop valuable and viable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

## The Reckoning and Upleveling Skills

The roles of delivery team product owners and feature team product managers are currently facing a "reckoning," with companies realizing these roles may not provide the expected value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. This trend is expected to be compounded by generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.

To thrive, individuals in product roles need to **[[the_role_and_impact_of_managers_in_career_development | uplevel their skills]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. This means shifting focus away from administrative tasks like backlog management (which can be automated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a> and towards true product management:
*   **Value and Viability** Product managers are primarily responsible for ensuring a solution is valuable to customers and viable for the business (e.g., salable, marketable, legal, serviceable, compliant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **Deep Expertise** This includes becoming an expert on users and customers, understanding product data, and representing broader business concerns like compliance, sales, marketing, and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Critical Thinking** Product professionals must learn to think critically and use their judgment, especially when consuming information online, as much of it perpetuates the "feature team" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

## The Product Operating Model and Key Competencies

The "product operating model" describes the principles and practices used by the best product companies consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. It's not a process but a conceptual model focused on outcomes, not just output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>.

Key competencies within this model, which many companies lack, include:
*   **Real Product Managers** Focused on value and viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.
*   **Real Product Designers** Proficient in service, interaction, visual design, and user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.
*   **Real Tech Leads** Guiding the technical direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.
*   **Real Product Leaders** Managers who can coach their teams and develop a robust product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

In this model, leaders are responsible for product strategy and "big bets" (e.g., Meta's top-down strategy coupled with team empowerment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>, while empowered teams are given the latitude to figure out the best way to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

### Principles of the Product Operating Model
*   **Innovation over Predictability:** Prioritize learning and exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.
*   **Principles over Process:** Focus on underlying principles rather than rigid methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>.
*   **Empowered Teams:** Teams are given problems to solve and foster a real sense of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.
*   **Continuous Discovery:** Address product risks, embrace quick experimentation, and test ideas responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>.
*   **Frequent, Uncoupled Releases:** Prioritize small, frequent, and independent deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>.
*   **Instrumentation and Monitoring:** Everything released should be instrumented and monitored to prove outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>.

## The Role of Product Operations (Product Ops)

[[building_and_managing_growth_teams | Product Ops]] is analogous to DevOps and Design Ops, typically bringing together user research and data analysts under one leader to support product teams in making qualitative and quantitative decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. While valuable, some companies misuse Product Ops to justify giving product managers "assistants" or to offload leadership responsibilities onto them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. Effective Product Ops functions as a small, high-leverage group that helps teams, similar to data analysts and user research teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>.

## Hiring Product Managers in Startups

Founders often express reluctance to hire product managers, fearing they might hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. However, many eventually find that a good product manager is precisely what they need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>. It's often advised to avoid hiring a product manager too soon, as the founder's job in the early stages is to handle product value and viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. A useful heuristic is to consider hiring a product manager once a company reaches a certain scale, such as having 20-25 engineers, as it becomes more beneficial to have others responsible for value and viability at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>.

## The Core of Continuous Discovery

Everything in a product backlog is a "bet" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>]. [[continuous_discovery | Discovery]] helps teams make better bets [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>]. It's crucial to understand that product development is not phased, where one first discovers and then delivers; instead, it's about being "always delivering and always discovering" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>]. Building a [[continuous_discovery | discovery]] habit consistently leads to better bets over time [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>].

Teresa Torres, author of *Continuous Discovery Habits*, defines [[continuous_discovery | continuous discovery]] as incorporating continuous feedback loops by regularly including the customer in the decision-making process about what to build [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>]. This approach acknowledges that digital products are never truly "done," requiring continuous iteration and improvement as customer needs evolve [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>].

## Understanding the Opportunity Solution Tree

The Opportunity Solution Tree is a framework that helps product teams structure their approach to [[leveraging_user_insights_for_product_development | leveraging user insights for product development]] by starting with an outcome and branching into opportunities and solutions [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>]. This visual tool adds structure to the complex problem of deciding what to build when starting from an outcome, moving teams away from simply being told what features to build [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>].

An "opportunity" is defined as an unmet need, pain point, or desire [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>]. A common challenge is differentiating opportunities from solutions, as many tend to frame opportunities as solutions [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>]. Effective product development requires getting "comfortable in the problem space" or opportunity space, taking time to frame problems before jumping to solutions [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>].

For example, in streaming entertainment, an outcome might be to increase engagement [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>]. Opportunities could be structured around an experience map, such as the process of deciding what to watch [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>]. Specific pain points like "it's hard to enter my password with the Apple TV remote" are valuable, specific opportunities that can be solved [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>]. Focusing on such specific opportunities allows for actionable solutions, unlike vague statements like "I wish this was easier to use" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>].

## The Importance of Customer Interviews and Feedback Gathering

Opportunities emerge directly from customer stories [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>]. This highlights the criticality of effective customer interaction and feedback gathering.

### Common Interviewing Mistakes to Avoid
Many teams make mistakes by asking direct questions out of context, such as "What do you like to watch on Netflix?" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>]. While easy to answer, these responses don't accurately reflect behavior, lack context, and miss nuance [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>].

Another significant error is focusing on what people *would* do or *think* they would do in a hypothetical situation, rather than what they *actually did* [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>]. This can lead to unreliable data, as product teams are in the business of understanding and changing behavior [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>].

### Best Practices for Interviewing
Interviewing should feel like a natural, casual conversation, similar to "having a beer with a buddy" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>]. The key is to elicit the customer's story by being curious about their experiences [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>]. By asking questions like "Tell me about the last time you watched a movie," interviewers can gather rich details about the specific instance, including context, actions, and underlying unmet needs or pain points [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>]. This approach often reveals needs customers are not even consciously aware of [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>].

### Automating Customer Recruitment
To sustain regular customer interviews, a common strategy is to allow customers to opt-in while they are using the product or service [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>]. Similar to an NPS survey, a prompt like "Do you have 20 minutes to talk to us?" can be embedded directly in the product [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>]. If they agree, scheduling software can be used to book a time directly on the team's calendar [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>].

For B2B environments or reaching buyers and decision-makers, internal teams like sales, account managers, or support staff who regularly interact with customers can facilitate recruitment [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>]. By defining a weekly trigger (e.g., "we're looking to talk to someone experiencing this pain point"), these internal teams can use scheduling software to book interviews directly, minimizing the product team's administrative burden [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>].

## Overcoming Challenges in Incorporating User Feedback

### Addressing "No Time for Discovery"
The perception of "no time for discovery" often stems from outdated project-based research methods [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>]. However, [[continuous_discovery | continuous discovery]] can be done with as little as "an interview a week" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>]. Instead of pausing development for extensive research, teams should continue making "bets" (delivering) while simultaneously doing some [[continuous_discovery | discovery]] to improve those bets over time [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>].

Individual contributors who face a "feature factory" environment are encouraged to empower themselves by proactively seeking out customers to talk to, even if it means leveraging personal networks [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>]. This independent initiative allows for better-informed decisions, even when solutions are prescribed [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>].

### Collaboration in Product Development
Effective product development thrives on collaboration, rather than relying on a single "decider" or "CEO of the product" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>]. The ideal "trio" of product manager, designer, and software engineer works from a shared understanding derived from [[continuous_discovery | discovery]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>]. When disagreements arise, a well-functioning team seeks a better option rather than forcing one's opinion, fostering a collaborative "doing" mindset over political posturing [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>]. This approach contributes to a more integrated design, marketing, and engineering effort.

### Addressing Cynicism About Small Data
Concerns about making decisions based on limited user research (e.g., "how few people you talk to") are common, especially in larger companies [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>]. A key response is to highlight that "one [interview] is better than zero" [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>].

Teams in [[continuous_discovery | continuous discovery]] are in the business of changing behavior, not seeking new knowledge, and rely on robust feedback loops [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>]. Decisions can be made based on small experiments because there will be continuous opportunities for larger, more reliable data through subsequent deliveries and live production prototyping [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>]. The goal is not to prove everything upfront, but to iterate and learn continuously.

## Practical Tips for Integrating Feedback Loops

*   **Interviewing:**
    *   Focus on eliciting stories about past behavior ("Tell me about the last time you...") instead of hypothetical questions about future actions or opinions [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>].
    *   Maintain a natural, conversational cadence throughout the interview, showing curiosity about the user's experience [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>].
    *   Slow down and "dig into" moments of friction or interesting points the user mentions, rather than staying shallow and moving on too quickly [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>].

*   **Assumption Testing:**
    *   Break down large ideas into their underlying, specific assumptions [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>].
    *   Prioritize these assumptions and design small, rapid tests to validate or invalidate them, rather than lengthy, expensive experiments testing the entire idea [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>].
    *   A continuous [[continuous_discovery | discovery]] practice should aim to run "half a dozen to a dozen assumption tests in one week" across multiple ideas [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>].

*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Not all solutions require extensive [[continuous_discovery | discovery]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>]. Assess the level of risk involved in each "bet" and the necessary mitigation [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>].
    *   When new to [[continuous_discovery | discovery]], it's advisable to "over index on doing a little too much discovery" to hone judgment on risk [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>].
    *   When working on core product functionality or differentiators, generate "multiple solutions for the same opportunity" to compare and contrast options, guarding against biases towards an obvious solution [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>].

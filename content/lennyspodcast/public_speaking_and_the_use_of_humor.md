Dares Shaw, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot, is known for his unique and analytical approach to [[public_speaking_tips_for_storytellers | public speaking]], particularly his obsession with comedy and keynote preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Despite public speaking not coming naturally to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, he has developed a systematic method to excel in it, treating it as an [[transformative_nature_of_improving_public_speaking_skills | acquirable skill]] rather than an innate talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Dares Shaw's Approach to Public Speaking

Shaw views public speaking as a skill that can be functionally decomposed into sub-skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. His initial goal was simply to be able to stand on stage without passing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. For high-stakes speaking engagements, such as HubSpot's annual conference, where audiences grew from 150 to over 10,000 live attendees and hundreds of thousands online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, holding the audience's attention is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

Each year, Shaw focuses on improving a different aspect of [[techniques_for_developing_impactful_speeches | public speaking]], such as slide design or visual expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The area that has had the most significant impact for him is humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Measuring Humor: Laughs Per Minute (LPM)

To objectively assess and improve the comedic elements of his talks, Shaw uses a metric called "Laughs Per Minute" (LPM), which is utilized by stand-up comedians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. He has developed custom software that transcribes his practice talks and identifies points where the audience audibly laughed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This software provides a visual map of the talk, showing periods without laughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Higher LPM is strongly correlated with the popularity of TED Talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. For a business talk, a minimum LPM of 2 or more is challenging but signifies a strong performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. For non-professionals, achieving an LPM above 1.25 places a talk in the top decile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

To improve LPM, there are two main strategies:
1.  **Add more laughs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
2.  **Decrease the number of words between laughs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

If a segment goes too long without a laugh (e.g., over a minute), Shaw identifies it as an area to either shorten or inject more humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. He regularly runs his talk transcripts and audio through his program to evaluate his performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

## Tactical Advice for Incorporating Humor

Shaw offers practical [[public_speaking_tips_for_storytellers | tips for incorporating humor]] into presentations, drawing from stand-up comedy techniques:

*   **Punchline Placement**: The funny part of a story should literally be the last words of that segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Pause After Punchline**: After delivering a punchline, stop talking. The audience needs about half a second to react and "permission" to laugh. Continuing to speak makes them feel awkward and reduces the humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Multiple Punchlines**: Once a story's context is set up, leverage that investment by having multiple funny bits or punchlines within the same narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. A laugh is a laugh, regardless of its magnitude, so maximize them within a single story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

Shaw emphasizes that public speaking is an [[transformative_nature_of_improving_public_speaking_skills | acquirable skill]] through [[public_speaking_exercises_and_games | practice]] and [[techniques_for_developing_impactful_speeches | measurement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. He encourages learning by finding a problem one cares about and trying to solve it using the desired skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.

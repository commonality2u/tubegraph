Elena Verna, an expert in growth strategy, shares her strong opinions on the use of freemium versus trial models in product marketing, particularly within the B2B space. She argues that while both allow for free product usage, freemium generally offers a better path than trials due to fundamental differences in their approach and long-term strategic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

## Defining Freemium and Trial Models

*   **Freemium**: A model where users are allowed to use a product in some free capacity, often with feature walls or usage walls, but with an ongoing, "forever free" component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:09">[04:09:09]</a>.
*   **Trial**: Similar to freemium, users can use the product, but it includes a superficial time-bound component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

Verna states that, at the end of the day, both are essentially the same in allowing free usage; the key difference is the presence of a time limit in trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:32">[04:32:32]</a>.

## Critiques of the Trial Model

Verna highlights several issues with time-bound trial models:

*   **Inflexible Timeframes**: The amount of time needed to try a product can vary significantly between users. A small startup might need 24-48 hours, while a large enterprise with many dependencies could need a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>.
*   **Alienating Enterprises**: Companies using time-based trials, especially in the B2B segment, fundamentally alienate large enterprises from truly trying their products, as the trial period often doesn't align with their complex workflows and longer evaluation cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:10">[04:52:10]</a>. This often forces enterprises to constantly renew trials until they can materialize value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:10">[04:52:10]</a>.
*   **Stressful for Users**: A time-bound trial can create a stressful environment where users feel pressured to evaluate a new product within an arbitrary timeframe, which may not align with their busy schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:03">[04:49:03]</a>.

Instead of a superficial time component, Verna suggests pushing towards a different usage metric that is not time-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:55">[04:53:55]</a>.

## Advantages and Strategic Reasons for Freemium

Verna advocates for freemium models, asserting that "freemium case for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, especially when a company is trying to land a customer they might not even want to monetize at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. She emphasizes that the biggest mistake is to think of freemium solely as a conversion rate optimization tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:03">[04:49:03]</a>. Instead, freemium should have a clear strategic business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

Strategic reasons for having a freemium offering include:

*   **Proof of Concept (POC)**: Allowing users to play around with the product to understand if it's the right solution, without a time limit. MongoDB, for instance, offers a free community cluster for development, which is usage-based rather than time-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. This addresses products with high friction activation, where connecting to data sources or standing up databases can take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   **Indirect Monetization / Virality**: The free offering drives user acquisition through virality or network effects, even if those users never directly convert to paid. Miro, for example, offers three editable boards for free, knowing that free users will share and collaborate with others, thereby acquiring new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. SurveyMonkey also had half its user base as free, healthy, and retained, which was responsible for 100% of their acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:03">[04:49:03]</a>.
*   **Strategic Land**: Using freemium to land a customer segment that a company isn't monetizing immediately but intends to expand with later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Commoditization Response**: If a product's offering has become commoditized in the market, providing a freemium version can be a necessity. The challenge then becomes differentiating the free offering through innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Breeding Ground for New Use Cases/Personas**: Freemium can serve as an environment to discover adjacent use cases and personas, allowing companies to pivot their roadmap and be first to spot new market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:03">[04:49:03]</a>.
*   **Data Collection**: Leveraging the freemium base to collect data that helps build and improve paid products. LinkedIn is cited as a perfect example, building paid products like Sales Navigator on top of their strong freemium base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

## Framework for Designing a Freemium Model

When deciding what to make free in a freemium model, Verna suggests a framework based on checking specific boxes:

*   Does it help with [[unique_pricing_and_product_adoption_strategies | indirect monetization]] (e.g., virality or network effects)? If so, make it free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   Does it suffice for every user, regardless of complexity? If so, it might be a commoditized feature that should be free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   Does it help achieve the "aha moment" for users? If yes, it should be part of the free offering as a POC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
*   Does it create habit loops (e.g., notifications, channel communication)? If so, make it free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

Ultimately, anything that creates friction for the growth model should be gated in the paid offering, while anything that promotes the growth model should be put into the free offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. The decision should be heavily dependent on the actual monetization strategy, focusing on how free helps achieve growth model outcomes without sacrificing monetization potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

A key guiding light for any product manager (PM) is to wake up every day striving to have the biggest impact possible for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. For leaders, this extends to using their team to achieve the greatest possible impact for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This focus should influence every part of a PM's day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Driven by Impact, Not Promotion

The core principle is to be driven by impact, not by the pursuit of promotion, internal politics, or managing a larger organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Focusing on having the greatest impact for the business is a strong indicator of an individual's likelihood of promotion, rather than making promotion the sole focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

When starting a career at Amazon, success was attributed to a hunger for impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. The objective was for the business's key success metrics to continuously improve, not just to hit specific goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. This involved working with the team to focus on projects with the greatest leverage and marshaling all team resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. This approach aligned well with Amazon's [[leveraging_first_principles_thinking_in_product_management | working backwards]] approach from a fitness function or metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

### Impact for New vs. Senior Product Managers

For new PMs, the focus is on having an impact by shipping a project or feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. They are often given specific tasks rather than significant latitude to build their own roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. As PMs become more senior, there are increasing opportunities to identify and pursue larger impacts, influencing [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_product_management | prioritization]] and roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

The expectation for impact shifts from being "nice to have" for junior PMs to a primary evaluation criterion for more senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. A person who has a massive impact on the business should be the one who grows and is assigned bigger challenges, as their impact at a larger scale is even more critical for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. This illustrates the "flywheel of product leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

New PMs can benefit from choosing projects that are likely to have a significant impact, even if they aren't responsible for setting the strategy or [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_product_management | prioritizing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. Working on "offense" projects that drive revenue or customer growth tends to capture executive attention more than risk mitigation or cost-efficiency initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

## Thinking Big

[[top_attributes_of_a_successful_product_manager | "Think big"]] is a crucial attribute, especially for senior PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. It means always seeking opportunities for greater impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Inspired by Warren Buffett's concept of "hunting for bigger elephants," PMs should pause at the beginning of any idea or solution to ask: "Could this be bigger? Could this be a bigger thing and more impactful than the initial idea?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. This often involves expanding the scope beyond the initial concept, even if the initial idea seems large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. The goal is to start small but with a grander vision in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

For senior PMs, [[advice_for_improving_strategic_thinking_in_product_managers | thinking big]] involves moving beyond the typical scope of product management, which might focus on roadmaps and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. Instead, it means taking a much wider view of what contributes to a product's success across various disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. Even if other functions like marketing or engineering don't report directly to the PM, they should be "owned" until someone else can take ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. This implies understanding the full business context and removing any constraints or barriers to the product's success, regardless of their nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. It is about thinking like an owner of the entire business, not just one product bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

### Interconnection of Thinking Big and Impact

The emphasis on thinking big directly fuels the ability to drive impact. By envisioning larger opportunities and taking a broader view of their role, product managers can identify and pursue initiatives that yield significantly greater results for the company. This strategic approach ensures that efforts are directed towards the most impactful areas, aligning with the core objective of a successful PM.

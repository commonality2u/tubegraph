[[Relationship between OKRs mission vision and strategy | Mission]] and [[Developing a product vision and communicating it effectively | vision]] are distinct but complementary concepts in product development, often confused by product managers. Understanding the difference is crucial for effective product leadership and team alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Defining Vision

A product's [[Developing a product vision and communicating it effectively | vision]] is a "picture" or "image of the destination" — what the world will look like once the product has succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. It articulates the desired future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

### Elements of a Good Vision
A good product [[Developing a product vision and communicating it effectively | vision]] should possess four key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>:
*   **Lofty** - It should inspire and feel exciting, almost scary, providing a compelling reason to work towards it every morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Realistic and Attainable** - While ambitious, it shouldn't feel so "pie in the sky" that it seems completely out of reach for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. However, inspirational [[Role of product leaders | leaders]] can convince others of seemingly impossible visions through their confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Devoid of Today's Limitations** - It should be imagined in a vacuum, without considering current technical or resource constraints. The purpose of envisioning the future is to identify what needs to be fixed or put in place now to get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Grounded in a Potent Problem** - The vision must solve a clear and significant problem that resonates with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Examples of Vision
*   **Uber's Vision** - A world where you get a continuous trip, eliminating the need for parking. This frees up vast city spaces currently used for parking for other purposes like homes or restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This vision led to initiatives like Uber Pool to maximize car occupancy and autonomous vehicles to keep cars constantly moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Microsoft's Vision** - "A computer on every desk and in every home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **Tesla's Vision** - "Create the most compelling car company of the 21st century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   **Lyft's Vision** - "A world where cities feel small again where transportation and Tech bring people together instead of a part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

## Defining Mission

A [[Developing a product vision and communicating it effectively | mission]] defines the purpose or "why" a company or product exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. It explains the purpose for its actions and may include guiding principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Examples of Mission
*   **Uber's Mission** - Originally, "Push a button, get a ride. Transportation as reliable as running water." This evolved to a more inclusive version: "Reliable transport sanitation everywhere and for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This mission emphasizes *why* Uber exists (to make transportation reliable globally) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **TED's Mission** - "To spread ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Stripe's Mission** - "Increased the GDP of the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Ikea's Mission** - "Create a better everyday life for many for the many people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Comparison and Role in Product Development

The core difference is captured by an analogy: If climbing Mount Everest, the **vision** is describing the picture at the summit (Himalayas, above the clouds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. The **mission** is the purpose for doing it – "to demonstrate that we're able to do it and making sure that we both get there together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

*   **Vision: The Destination** - A snapshot of the future, what it *looks like* when you achieve your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. It helps decide if a specific goal or problem is something a team wants to tackle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Mission: The Purpose** - The fundamental reason *why* the product or company exists and operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

Both are essential for product development, providing a clear [[Role of Product Managers | North Star]] for teams and guiding decisions. A compelling [[Developing a product vision and communicating it effectively | vision]] helps align teams, increasing velocity and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, while a clear [[Developing a product vision and communicating it effectively | mission]] articulates the core purpose.

> "The mission is essentially the why and why you exist and the purpose for your team/company and the vision like the word vision is almost tells you what it is it's like what it looks like when you get there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

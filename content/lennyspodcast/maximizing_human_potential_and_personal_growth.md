At the heart of building and leading, Toby acknowledges that his primary energy source is a "dissatisfaction with the status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This drive fuels his belief that everyone has untapped capabilities and can achieve far more than they currently believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## Unleashing Potential
A core conviction for Toby is that "there is not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He believes that performance limitations often stem from ingrained ideas or insufficient methods for cultivating skills, or environments that foster unambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

Instead, Toby advocates for:
*   **Constant Reminders of Potential** Constantly reminding people of their own potential is "actually a wonderful thing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **High Standards** Holding people to a high standard often leads them to "accomplish very often things that just they didn't imagine they could" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This is a through-line for his entire career, as he aims for his product to enable users to become more successful and ambitious than they initially thought possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Direct Feedback** Feedback from Toby is often described as "very direct and often hard to hear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. However, this directness is seen as a way to [[the_role_of_personal_growth_and_selfawareness_for_founders | maximize their potential]] and push them towards betterment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Self-Challenge** Toby applies the same high standards to himself, admitting he is "harder on myself than on anyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. He continuously tries to cultivate the skills needed for tomorrow and challenges his own limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## The Pursuit of Learning and Curiosity
Toby emphasizes the importance of following curiosity and optimizing for learning. This approach has led him to realize that "the world's full of lies about human potential and progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. He criticizes traditional education systems that discourage meandering and exploration, contrasting it with a belief that there is "no speed limit for personal growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

This commitment to continuous learning and exploration has been a key driver in Shopify's evolution, serving as an "experimental lab" for his convictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

## Courage as a Catalyst
Toby identifies courage as an extremely rare quality, often more so than high IQ or genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. He actively seeks out and encourages disagreement, seeing it as a sign of courage and a way to build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>. Disagreement helps uncover unstated foundational assumptions, leading to better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

[!NOTE]
Toby believes that lowering the "net amount of courage needed" is a powerful way to enable more people to start and succeed, potentially reinventing entire industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>. An example of this is Instagram's "try run" feature for Reels, which allows users to test content with a small audience before a full public release, reducing the fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.

## Career as a Product: The Talent Stack
Toby views one's career as a product or "Talent as a Service," where individuals are "selling a subscription in the form of our employment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:48">[01:34:48]</a>. He advises focusing on what makes you "too good to ignore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:37">[01:35:37]</a>.

[[the_magic_loop_for_career_growth | The Magic Loop for career growth]] involves finding a "triplicate intersection of three different things" where you possess unique expertise, allowing you to "nail it" for a specific audience rather than trying to appeal to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:54">[01:32:54]</a>. This leads to building a loyal base of "a thousand true fans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>.

## Overcoming Complexity for Growth
Toby sees a "moral obligation" to create legible interfaces and tame "enormous complexity with great UX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>. When software is poorly designed, it can make people feel "dumb," which inverts the natural hierarchy of machines serving humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

Shopify's experience has rigorously demonstrated that "every single time we make a complex thing simpler, it is actually that more businesses will exist on a platform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. This is because prospective entrepreneurs, especially "first-time entrepreneurs," are often unsophisticated, scared, and discouraged by naysayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. When they encounter unexpected complexity (like APIs or confusing tax configurations), they may give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>. By simplifying these aspects, Shopify fosters more entrepreneurship and creates more businesses that "could now employ people and delight customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:10">[01:25:10]</a>. This ongoing effort to simplify complex processes is a significant "source of energy" for Toby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:22">[01:25:22]</a>.

[!TIP]
For product leaders, Toby emphasizes three crucial roles to ensure high-quality output and foster a team that "gives a shit" about the product:
1.  **Understand the Product Better:** The team must "look around corners" and understand what's being built better than everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>.
2.  **Exothermic Enthusiasm:** The product leader must be "exothermically infectious" with their care for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. This alone can lead to a "10 times better product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:15]</a>.
3.  **Care Genuinely:** "Do not engage in product work on product that you don't care about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:53">[01:37:53]</a> because it's impossible to produce great results without genuine passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:26">[01:37:26]</a>.

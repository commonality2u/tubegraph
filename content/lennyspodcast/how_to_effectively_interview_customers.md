Interviewing customers effectively is crucial for understanding their true needs and motivations, moving beyond superficial "pain and gain" analyses to uncover the deeper context and desired outcomes that drive their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach, central to the "Jobs to be Done" (JTBD) framework, posits that people "hire" products to make progress in their lives, rather than simply buying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Key Principles for Effective Customer Interviews

### Focus on Context and Outcomes, Not Just Pain
A common misconception about JTBD is focusing solely on pain and gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The more accurate perspective is to understand the *context* in which a customer finds themselves and the specific *outcome* they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The context makes seemingly irrational behavior rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For example, eating a Snickers bar when hungry might seem irrational for a candy bar, but in the context of needing quick energy and a feeling of fullness, it competes with a protein drink or coffee, not another candy bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

### Identify Struggling Moments
All innovation and demand begin with a "struggling moment," not with a product idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Studying these moments helps companies understand what customers truly want, rather than trying to sell them things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. This approach can redefine a company's roadmap, shifting from planning features to addressing customer struggles, which can be solved in multiple ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### The Four Forces of Progress
When customers consider a new product, four forces are at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>:
1.  **Push (F1):** A problem or dissatisfaction with the current situation or product that drives the customer away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This context has nothing to do with the new product but is the reason for leaving the old one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
2.  **Pull (F2):** The attraction of a new solution or the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
3.  **Anxiety (F3):** Concerns or fears associated with adopting a new solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
4.  **Habit of the Present (F4):** The inertia and comfort of the existing routine or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[01:03:12]</a>.

For a customer to switch, the "push" and "pull" forces must be greater than the "anxiety" and "habit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[01:03:12]</a>. More features can actually increase anxiety, making a product less appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[01:03:12]</a>. Reducing friction (F3 and F4) can increase adoption without changing the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[01:03:12]</a>.

## Customer [[effective_customer_interaction_and_feedback_gathering | Interaction and Feedback Gathering]] Techniques

The interview method is based on criminal and intelligence interrogation techniques, focusing on understanding the causal mechanisms behind customer behavior, not just their stated preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

### Interviewing Steps
1.  **Frame the Question:** Start by asking what causes people to say "today's the day" they want to make a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
2.  **Find Recent Purchasers/Switchers:** Seek out individuals who have recently purchased your product, a competitor's product, or churned from your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.
    *   **Churned Customers:** People who have left your product are still making progress, but found your solution insufficient in a new context, revealing crucial struggling moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.
3.  **Extract the Story:** Listen to the customer's full story about *why* they made the purchase, what was going on, their hopes, worries, what they gave up, and how they convinced others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.
4.  **Identify Forces and Trade-offs:** The stories will reveal the pushes, pulls, anxieties, habits, and "hire and fire criteria" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
5.  **Cluster, Don't Segment:** Instead of looking for themes across all interviews, cluster pathways of behavior. Different customers may hire a product for different jobs, leading to conflicts if a single product tries to satisfy all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. For example, Intercom segmented its product and pricing based on different customer jobs (e.g., acquisition vs. support) to compete with different solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
6.  **Understand Sources of Energy:** Look for functional (time, space, effort, knowledge), emotional (frustration, overlooked), and social (how others perceive me) energy driving behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

### [[best_practices_for_customer_interviewing | Best Practices for Customer Interviewing]]
*   **Read "Never Split the Difference":** Chris Voss's book on negotiation teaches techniques like mirroring and playing things back incorrectly to encourage further elaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   **Interview Those Who Have *Tried* to Make Progress:** Don't trust what people say they *will* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. Focus on people who have already acted, even if they failed, to understand their motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. The phrase "bitching ain't switching" highlights that dissatisfaction doesn't guarantee action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **No Discussion Guide:** Avoid rigid question lists, as they prevent following meaningful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. Instead, use the Four Forces as a framework to understand their story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **Ask "Tell Me More" or "Give Me an Example":** Avoid asking "why" repeatedly. Focus on eliciting stories and specific instances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   **Push to the "Edge of Language":** When interviewees run out of words, "bracket" their answers by offering extreme choices (e.g., "was it more about this or that?"). This forces them to elaborate on why neither option fully captures their experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Unpack Layers of Language:** People often provide superficial or exaggerated answers first.
    *   **Platitudes:** "It was good." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>
    *   **Fantasy/Nightmare:** Exaggerated good or bad experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.
    *   **Actual Events:** The goal is to investigate and pull back to what actually happened, like an interrogator who makes it "feel like therapy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.
*   **Small Sample Size:** For causal mechanisms, studies often repeat around seven to eight interviews; 10-12 interviews are usually sufficient, often split into two rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. This is because you are looking for patterns in behavior, not statistical significance from random sampling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls and Misconceptions

*   **Hypothesizing in a Conference Room:** One of the most dangerous things is to sit in a room and guess what the jobs are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. This leads to inaccurate conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Features:** Simply adding more features can increase anxiety and doesn't guarantee adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Ignoring Irrationality:** When a story seems irrational, it's usually because the full context is missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. The context makes the irrational rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.
*   **Mistaking Price for Value:** Value is derived from the progress a customer makes, starting from their current state to their desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. Offering more than a customer needs can lead to price discounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.
*   **Relying on Best Users:** Following the desires of your best users can lead to over-engineering a product, making it too complicated for the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Supply-Side over Demand-Side:** Businesses often think about what they are selling, not what customers are truly buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. The JTBD framework emphasizes starting with the demand side (customer's struggling moments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>.

## When JTBD Interviews Are Not Suitable

The JTBD framework is less effective when:
*   **No Real Choice Exists:** If customers have limited or no choice (e.g., employer-provided health insurance), their "buying" decision isn't based on a deep job to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. In such cases, focusing on ethnography, frictional points, or prototyping around usage ("how") might be more useful than "why" they buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.
*   **Behavior is Too Habitual:** For deeply ingrained habits (e.g., buying chewing gum), customers often cannot recall the specifics of their purchase decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. The "job" is only revealed when people change their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

## Examples and Case Studies

*   **Snickers vs. Milky Way:** Snickers is "hired" as a meal replacement when energy is low, competing with protein drinks and coffee. Milky Way is "hired" for emotional comfort and regrouping, competing with wine or a run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU):** By studying "anomalies" who attended online in 2010, SNHU realized a different job to be done for older students with responsibilities, leading to massive growth in online education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Autobooks:** This company helped banks offer invoicing through services like Apple Pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. By adapting their [[crafting_an_effective_sales_pitch | sales pitch]] and demo process to meet customers at different stages of their "buying timeline" (first thought, passive looking, active looking, deciding, first use, ongoing use), they quadrupled conversion and halved the sales cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Real Estate (Condos):** When selling condos to downsizers, customers said they didn't want a dining room table. However, many cancelled due to the emotional struggle of parting with their large dining tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>. By including a symbolic space for a dining table (even if unusable for meals), sales increased by 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. This highlights the importance of emotional context and understanding the "irrational" parts of decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.
*   **Facebook Marketplace (Implied):** A large social media company found users transacting on their platform without a dedicated product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. By studying competitors like eBay and Etsy, they identified the underlying jobs of sellers and buyers, leading to a multi-billion dollar marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
*   **Intercom and Basecamp:** Both companies are cited as early adopters of JTBD principles. Intercom, for example, realized people hired their product for four different reasons and adjusted its pricing model and feature sets to align with these distinct jobs, competing effectively with different market players like HubSpot and Zendesk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. Basecamp famously resisted adding features like Gantt charts and resource allocation, recognizing that their core "job" was simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[importance_of_customer_and_user_research | Importance of Customer and User Research]] and [[importance_of_talking_to_customers_in_startups | Importance of talking to customers in startups]] cannot be overstated. By focusing on struggling moments, understanding the progress customers are trying to make, and making deliberate trade-offs that align with customer needs, businesses can foster true innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>. The goal is to enable customers to buy, not to convince them to purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

Andrew "Boz" Bosworth, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Meta, leads the company's efforts in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR), alongside consumer hardware like Quest and [[ray_ban_meta_smart_glasses | Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:53">[01:41:53]</a>. He created Meta's AR/VR organization, now known as Reality Labs, in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:38">[01:37:38]</a>.

## Development Philosophy in AR/VR

Bosworth's approach to product development in AR/VR emphasizes conviction and clear vision, even when initial user feedback might be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:13">[03:11:13]</a>. He believes that passionate engagement in a field leads to significantly more productive and smarter work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>. While not always passionate about a new area initially, he is open to exploring it, giving it about six months to see if he can develop that passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:02">[03:42:02]</a>.

He highlights the importance of making big, impactful bets for future growth. Meta has had two major decade-long investment areas: AI and Reality Labs (AR/VR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

### Key Features and Strategic Choices

Bosworth was personally "adamant" that features like hand tracking and mixed reality were integrated into Meta's headsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:09">[02:41:09]</a>. Despite some internal skepticism about these features being critical for mainstream adoption, he believed they were essential for ease of use and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>. He pushed for high performance benchmarks, even when teams deemed it impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:33">[02:58:33]</a>.

## Comparing Meta Quest with Apple Vision Pro

Bosworth and Mark Zuckerberg jointly tried the Apple Vision Pro headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. They found that the technology inside the Vision Pro did not represent a "fundamental breakthrough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. While acknowledging Apple's legendary attention to detail and polish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>, they believe Meta's Quest 3 offers the "actual best headset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

### Apple Vision Pro's Strengths:
*   High resolution for stationary movie watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
*   Well-tuned passthrough for stationary use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.
*   Polished UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.
*   Advanced eye tracking, though it requires prescription inserts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

### Meta Quest's Advantages (according to Bosworth):
*   Superior hand tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   Wider field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06">[01:42:06]</a>.
*   Brighter displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:59">[01:42:59]</a>.
*   Less motion blur in mixed reality use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>.
*   Inclusion of controllers, which expands capabilities beyond hand tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a>.
*   Lower price point, offering better value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>.

Bosworth highlights that many people haven't even tried the Quest 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a>, which supports features like remote desktop to set up multiple virtual monitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:58">[01:50:58]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Meta continues to innovate in AR/VR. Bosworth mentioned playing with AR glasses that have full AR capabilities, with a rumored internal version potentially coming soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. These "time machines" offer exciting possibilities, such as giving speeches with notes displayed on the glasses and controlling slides with gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>.

Despite a public downturn and stock price drop, Meta remains committed to its long-term investments in areas like Reality Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. Bosworth stresses the importance of clearly communicating these long-term bets to the market and public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>. This transparency and conviction are seen as crucial for navigating market fluctuations and ensuring continued growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

Jessica Lax, VP of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, holds a "fairly contrarian perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:57">[02:30:57]</a> on the optimal structure for data teams within companies, advocating for a centralized model over an embedded one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This approach aims to position analytics as a business impact-driving function, not merely a service function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Centralized Model at DoorDash

At DoorDash, the analytics team operates under a centralized model, meaning all data professionals report up through a central analytics organization, rather than being embedded within specific business units like marketing or operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

Despite the centralized reporting structure, the team is organized into "pods" that align perfectly with product, engineering, operations, and marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This arrangement ensures that data professionals are de facto embedded with their partner teams, fostering a strong sense of unity and shared goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The analytics team shares the same objectives as their partner teams, aligning incentives and ensuring focus on the most impactful work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Jessica emphasizes that this model is not about creating a siloed data team that only responds to requests; instead, the analytics team acts as business and thought partners, proactively identifying opportunities and contributing to decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Benefits of a Centralized Data Organization

Lax outlines several key benefits of a centralized data organization:

*   **Consistent and High Talent Bar**
    *   A centralized structure allows for a consistent bar in hiring, ensuring that all data professionals meet specific technical and soft skill standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Growth Opportunities and Talent Retention**
    *   Unlike siloed teams where career progression might be limited, a central organization provides diverse growth opportunities, allowing team members to explore new problem areas across different parts of the company (e.g., moving from marketing analytics to merchant analytics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This flexibility helps in retaining talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Consistency of Methodologies and Metrics**
    *   A centralized team ensures that key business metrics, such as "sales," are defined and used consistently across the entire company, preventing discrepancies and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. It also allows for the improvement of methodologies with broader input and prevents redundant work across different teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Scalability and Proactive Problem Solving**
    *   A centralized view enables the identification of recurring problems across multiple teams, allowing the data organization to proactively address and automate solutions, improving efficiency as the business scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Strong Team Culture and Brand**
    *   A centralized structure fosters a unique team culture of learning and sharing, where members can collaborate, peer-review work, and find like-minded colleagues, enhancing internal pride and external recruiting efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. At Airbnb, for example, the first data team was called "The A Team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

### Addressing Perceived Drawbacks

While business leaders may favor embedded data teams for perceived ownership and control over roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, Lax believes these concerns can be mitigated in a centralized model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

*   **Mitigating the "Service Org" Perception**: By establishing the data team as thought partners with shared goals and a seat at the table, the perception of being a mere "service function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a> that only answers questions is avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Data teams are expected to bring insights, deep dives, and propose opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Carving Out Time for Proactive Work**: To prevent reactive query answering from consuming all time, intentional strategies are needed. DoorDash implements hackathons to dedicate time for exploratory work and sets team goals around finding insights through self-directed efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. This proactive approach has led to significant insights that drive future roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
*   **Managing Inbound Requests**: Data teams should learn to manage inbound requests by communicating tradeoffs. By aligning goals with business partners and transparently showing what work will be delayed if a new request is taken on, teams can prioritize effectively and avoid being solely reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:30">[02:21:30]</a>.

### Fostering Extreme Ownership

A key cultural element contributing to the success of the data team at DoorDash is [[empowering_product_teams | extreme ownership]] over outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. Data scientists are encouraged to go beyond their traditional roles if it means solving a problem, even if it involves calling customers for qualitative insights or performing tasks outside their direct job description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. This approach, deeply ingrained in DoorDash's culture from its founder Tony Xu, emphasizes a "roll up your sleeves" mentality to achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

## Global Data Organizations

When managing a global data organization, Lax notes that there are more similarities than differences in terms of people, consumers, and operational problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. However, complexities arise from differing currencies, languages, and regional regulations (e.g., between EU and non-EU countries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Having a foundation from a US-based business can provide an "answer key" for similar problems encountered internationally, though cultural or other differences can still lead to new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Data Team Efficiency

DoorDash is exploring [[leveraging_ai_for_data_team_efficiency | leveraging AI]] to enhance the productivity of its data team and empower non-technical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. An internal tool, "Ask Data AI," (named after an internal Slack channel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a> is being developed to help non-technical users edit queries independently, reducing the reliance on the analytics team for basic data tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.

While organic growth and word-of-mouth are often highlighted for social media platforms, partnerships and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) played a crucial, often unspoken, role in the early, hyper-growth phases of platforms like Instagram and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>.

## Instagram's Growth Engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>

Instagram's early growth leveraged a combination of strategies that compounded each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>:

*   **Invitations:** A core component was ensuring that invitations for new users worked well, encouraging friends to join and get notified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.
*   **Celebrity Partnerships:** A critical and often unspoken aspect of Instagram's growth was its celebrity partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>.
    *   Instagram had a "fantastic" Partnerships team that worked with celebrities, teaching them how to use the platform to tell their stories and build their personal brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.
    *   These celebrities set the norm for how the platform was used and generated news coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.
*   **SEO Component:** The news and media attention around celebrities using Instagram directly fed into an SEO engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.
    *   News articles would link to celebrity Instagram accounts or specific posts, creating inbound links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>.
    *   The launch of Instagram's web presence was crucial for creating canonical SEO tables and supporting international growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>. This immediately increased Instagram's growth by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>.
    *   Embeds for Instagram content on various sites, such as news articles or podcasts, further aided SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.
*   **Compounding Growth Loops:** These various growth engines — invitations, celebrity adoption, and SEO — compounded each other, magnifying the top of the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.

> [!info] The Power of Understanding
> Instagram's growth team heavily invested in "understand work" to determine what made for a good connection and how to grow a social graph effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:39">[02:28:39]</a>. This focus allowed them to derisk projects and learn quickly, ultimately leading to a higher win rate on shipped features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:11">[03:13:11]</a>.

A significant shift, known as the "connections pivot," occurred around 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. Initially, all follows were treated equally by the machine learning system, prioritizing celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. However, data showed that average users would sign up, follow celebrities, but then leave after several months because their friends weren't following them, leading to posts in a "silent echo chamber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>. The team convinced leadership to prioritize real human connections in the early user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. This change literally doubled Instagram's retention over a year and a half, contributing significantly to its skyrocketing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.

## Facebook's Global Reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:42">[01:25:42]</a>

As an early growth PM at Facebook, Bengali Caba worked on people recommendations globally, particularly focusing on South Asia and Southeast Asia after Facebook had already dominated North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>.

> [!info] The Necessity of Deep Understanding
> In India, Facebook's people graph appeared broken, with users having fewer common friends and engaging in frequent friending and unfriending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:11">[01:26:11]</a>. Initial hypotheses and tests based on data didn't provide a breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a>. This necessitated extensive "understand work," with the team physically on the ground in India, observing how people attempted to make friends and used features like "people you may know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>.

The "understand work" revealed critical cultural context that traditional data couldn't provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a>. For example, users in India found profile pages irrelevant because common names like "Amit Kumar" could apply to thousands of people, and Western-centric profile fields (school, job title, affiliations) were not culturally significant or easily identifiable for many users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:43">[01:27:43]</a>. Users instead relied on photos to identify friends, looking for familiar cars or animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>. This deep understanding highlighted the need for creative solutions tailored to regional nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>.

SEO was also a significant growth driver for Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:39">[01:14:39]</a>. When people Google someone's name, their Facebook profile often appears as one of the first five results, which is a result of intentional design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>.

Both Instagram and Facebook demonstrate that a multifaceted approach to growth, including strategic partnerships and robust SEO efforts, alongside product improvements driven by deep [[understand_work | understand work]], is essential for achieving and sustaining hyper-growth in social media.

Jessica Lax, Vice President of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, holds a strong, often contrarian, perspective on structuring data teams within companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Having built one of the largest and most respected data teams in tech at DoorDash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, Lax emphasizes that analytics should be a function that drives business impact, not merely a service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This means going beyond answering "why" to addressing "what do we do now that we know this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Centralized Model: A Seat at the Table

Lax believes that analytics should have a direct "seat at the table" alongside engineering, product, and business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Her preferred structure is a central model, or a "Center of Excellence," for data teams, which she considers superior to embedding analytics within business units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Defining the Structures
The core difference between centralized and embedded models lies primarily in reporting lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. In a centralized model, like DoorDash's, the marketing analytics team reports into the broader analytics team, not directly to marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. In contrast, an embedded model would have data analysts or scientists reporting to the head of marketing or another business unit lead, often with less connection to a core data team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Benefits of a Centralized Model
Lax identifies several key advantages of a centralized analytics organization:

*   **Consistent and High Talent Bar** Maintaining a consistent hiring bar for technical and soft skills leads to more consistent and higher-quality talent acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Growth Opportunities** A central organization allows for more diverse growth paths. If a data scientist is the most senior in a siloed unit, their career progression might be limited. Within a central org, they can explore opportunities in other company areas, tackle new problems, or find people management roles that might not exist in a smaller, embedded unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This also aids in [[building_and_scaling_a_data_organization|retaining talent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Consistency of Methodologies and Metrics** A centralized structure ensures that core metrics, like "sales," are defined and used consistently across the entire company, preventing disparate definitions or methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. It also allows for the improvement of methodologies with input from more people, avoiding redundant work like building the same churn prediction model on six different teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Scalability and Proactive Problem Solving** A central team can identify recurring problems across different business units, enabling automation or proactive improvements as the business scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Strong Team Culture and Brand** A central organization fosters a unique team culture of learning and sharing, creating a "data nerds" community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This shared identity is crucial for both internal camaraderie and external recruiting of top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. DoorDash's analytics team even calls themselves "The A Team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

### Avoiding the "Service Org" Trap
A common concern with centralized models is that they might become siloed "service organizations" that merely respond to requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Lax strongly rejects this model, stating her team are "business partners" and "thought partners" who share the same goals as their product, engineering, and operations counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

The DoorDash approach to [[crossfunctional_collaboration_in_data_teams|crossfunctional collaboration in data teams]] ensures this:
*   **Pod Structure** The central analytics team is divided into pods that align perfectly with product, engineering, operations, and marketing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Goal Alignment** The analytics team shares the same goals as their partner teams, ensuring incentives are aligned to work on the most important things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Their success is intertwined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Proactive Insights** The team is expected to bring insights, deep dives, and points of view to the table, identifying opportunities and making recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

> "For me analytics is a business impact driving function and not purely a service function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
> "It's about finding opportunities about having a point of view on the decisions that we should make not just answering the why but answering the the so what so what do we do now that we know this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>

### Managing Exploration vs. Requests
To ensure the team finds time for exploratory work and big ideas while still addressing day-to-day questions, DoorDash focuses on intentionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. This includes:
*   **Setting Goals for Insights** Goals are set around discovering insights through self-directed work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Hackathons** The team carves out dedicated days for hackathons to explore interesting problems and find opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. These deep dives have historically driven future roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. One hackathon, for example, uncovered significant referral fraud by actively testing referral processes and ordering numerous cupcakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   **Transparent Trade-offs** When new requests come in, the team communicates the trade-offs, making it clear which planned tasks might be dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. This allows for constant re-evaluation of priorities with business partners to ensure the team is working on the most impactful things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.

## Fostering Extreme Ownership
A key cultural aspect that supports this model is "extreme ownership" of outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. This means data scientists are expected to figure out what's happening, even if it requires stepping outside traditional roles, such as calling customers to gather qualitative research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. This willingness to "roll up your sleeves" and do whatever is necessary to solve a problem is instilled in all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

> "Yes you are a data scientist but your goal is to figure out what's happening and if that means that you're going to pick up the phone and call customers then that is what you're going to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>

## Metric Selection
A central data team is instrumental in defining and aligning on key metrics. Lax's learnings on metric selection include:

*   **Short-term Proxies for Long-term Outcomes** Instead of goal-setting on long-term, hard-to-move metrics like "retention" (which is "terrible to goal on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>), identify measurable short-term inputs that drive desired long-term outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
*   **Simplicity Over Perfection** Avoid complex composite metrics with opaque weightings, as they are hard to understand and work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. A simpler, even if imperfect, metric that people can intuitively grasp and discuss across the company is far more effective in driving real outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.
*   **Common Currency Quantification** Quantify different business levers (e.g., price changes, delivery times, marketing spend) in terms of a common currency, such as Gross Order Value (GOV) or volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. This allows for quick, informed trade-off decisions across different teams (e.g., marketing vs. logistics), enabling the business to prioritize the most impactful actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Focus on Edge Cases and Fail States** Don't just look at averages; intentionally set goals and create metrics around edge cases and "disaster deliveries" (e.g., "never delivered" orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>). Though rare, these can lead to significant churn and high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>. Addressing these extreme negative experiences, even if they represent a tiny portion of the business, can have a powerful impact on brand and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>.

## Global Data Organization
Managing a global data organization introduces complexities such as different currencies, languages, and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. However, Lax finds that many problems are surprisingly similar across regions, allowing for applying solutions learned in one market to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>. This "answer key" approach helps identify common issues and potential solutions, while still allowing for excitement when new, unique challenges arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>.

## Utilizing AI
Lax is excited about using AI to make the analytics team more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. DoorDash utilizes "office hours" where the analytics team provides support and teaches non-technical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. They are now building internal tools, like an AI-powered chatbot named "Ask Data AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>, to help non-technical users edit queries and perform data tasks independently, reducing the burden on the analytics team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.

## Hiring Philosophy and Diverse Backgrounds
Lax's own non-traditional background (she was an artist, then worked in investment banking, and became a data scientist out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>) informs her hiring philosophy. She focuses on curiosity, self-motivation, and problem-solving abilities, even if candidates lack a formal data science background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. She values individuals who "pull on the threads" to investigate anomalies without being told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

When hiring, Lax also seeks:
*   **Problem-solving Skills** Candidates are given real-world business cases, often from DoorDash's history, to assess their ability to break down problems and handle ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
*   **Adaptability and Decisiveness** How candidates react to being told they are wrong, how they integrate new information, and their ability to make decisions with imperfect information are crucial "soft skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.
*   **Diversity of Skills and Backgrounds** The analytics team is a "net importer" of talent from other departments like engineering, operations, marketing, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. This creates a unique environment where people from different professional and academic backgrounds (e.g., statistics, econometrics, consulting) can teach each other and foster a rich exchange of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. A diversity of experience from different company sizes (startups vs. large organizations) is also valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

In summary, Lax champions a centralized, impact-driven data team that is deeply embedded in [[crossfunctional_collaboration_in_data_teams|crossfunctional collaboration in data teams]] through shared goals and proactive engagement, fostering a culture of ownership and continuous learning while leveraging diverse talent and clear metric definitions.

Maggie Crowley, Vice President of Product at Toast, shares her insights on the [[key_traits_of_successful_product_managers | key traits of successful product managers]] based on her experience hiring, managing, and working with product professionals across various company stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. She notes that while many aspects of the role can differ between consumer, B2B, startup, or large companies, certain fundamental qualities remain consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Key Traits of Successful Product Managers

Crowley identifies three common threads among the best product managers she has encountered:

### 1. Simplifying Things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>

Successful PMs excel at breaking down complexity and identifying the single most important thing to focus on at any given moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This involves navigating numerous priorities, OKRs, and potential projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. It's not just about picking the one thing but also having the discipline to stick with it until it's finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

#### Building the Simplification Muscle
*   **Read content aloud:** When writing documents or emails, reading them aloud can reveal unnecessary complexity or unclear language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. The goal is to communicate clearly and concisely, prioritizing action over elaborate prose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Cut unnecessary words:** Many documents can be shortened by deleting introductory paragraphs or adjectives that don't add value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   **Apply the "Rule of Three":** Limiting strategies, conclusions, or next steps to three main points can significantly improve clarity and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This is a common business school principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   **Seek feedback and listen:** Engaging others to review and simplify work is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. PMs should be open to input, especially from experienced leaders or founders who have deep market insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Create a peer feedback group:** Maggie Crowley maintains a small Slack group with other product leaders to review each other's work and simplify ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Finding non-competitive peers for this can provide invaluable external perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Practice [[building_high_agency_in_product_management_roles | high agency]]:** Becoming adept at simplification requires confidence in decision-making and the "gumption to say no" to less impactful initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. PMs must be willing to make bets and be accountable for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### 2. Following Up on Results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>

Truly effective product managers don't just define metrics; they consistently follow up on the performance of launched products and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This is a rare and highly valued activity, especially by leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

#### Benefits of Following Up
*   **Visibility and recognition:** Proactively sharing results demonstrates accountability and competence to managers, increasing visibility for potential promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   **Continuous learning:** Analyzing why a product succeeded or failed provides invaluable insights, improving future decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. The more a PM ships and learns, the better they become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   **Building trust:** Consistently providing updates creates an aura of reliability, assuring stakeholders that initiatives are being handled thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

### 3. Carrying the Water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>

This refers to the willingness of PMs to undertake the "hard, boring, unglamorous work" that falls outside traditional role definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This includes tasks related to customer support, sales, marketing, writing copy, or project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

#### The PM's Unique Responsibility
*   **Ownership of outcomes:** Unlike engineers or designers whose primary job is to build or design, a PM's core responsibility is to deliver business results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. This means filling in any gaps to ensure the product achieves its intended impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.
*   **"When in doubt, it's your job":** If something needs to be done for the product to succeed, and no one else is doing it, it falls to the PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional center of the team:** PMs often serve as the emotional core, responsible for maintaining team motivation, excitement, and buy-in for the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. This requires consistent optimism and positivity, which is "hard work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **Unglamiours work is essential:** Many aspiring PMs envision a glamorous role focused on strategic decisions, but much of the job involves mundane tasks like QA, implementing with customers, or selling the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. No task is "above" a PM if it contributes to the product's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

## Product Management Career Progression

Becoming a truly proficient product manager takes years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. It's often not until about five years into the role that PMs feel truly confident in their decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

Staying at a single company for multiple years, observing product cycles, and seeing the consequences of decisions can be more valuable than frequent job-hopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. This deep immersion allows for significant learning and ultimately faster career advancement later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

### [[breaking_into_product_management | Breaking into Product Management]]

Getting the initial PM title on a resume is often the hardest step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. Common paths include:
*   **MBA programs:** Some entry-level programs in big tech companies accept MBA students, though these are highly competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.
*   **Internal lateral moves:** Transitioning to a PM role within an existing company is a common, albeit challenging, route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
*   **Joining startups:** Startups may be more willing to hire individuals without prior PM experience, especially if they demonstrate strong potential and willingness to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. This often requires significant mentorship from managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>.

Once an individual has been a PM, the hiring process becomes significantly easier, with the next key question being "What have you shipped?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

## Product Strategy

A well-articulated product strategy is essential for aligning teams and making informed decisions, especially as a PM's role becomes more senior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. It helps PMs be confident in their bets and effectively communicate rationale.

### Components of a Product Strategy Document
Crowley's recommended structure for a comprehensive strategy document helps connect the company's overarching mission to specific team priorities, ensuring a clear "logic chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
1.  **Mission & Goals:** Start with the company's mission and overarching goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.
2.  **Landscape:** Detail the broader context, including:
    *   Business and product status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.
    *   Market perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.
    *   Competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.
    *   SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.
    *   Key risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.
    *   Current quarterly or annual business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
3.  **Current State:** Provide an honest assessment of the product, business, and specific area of focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>. This includes what works, what doesn't, customer feedback (bottom-up and support tickets), and technical hurdles or debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
4.  **Opportunity:** Identify the top one or two opportunities for the team based on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Define where the team can uniquely compete and win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.
5.  **Challenges:** Outline the difficulties in seizing the identified opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>, including what must be true for the strategy to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>.
6.  **Solution & Plan:** Propose a solution, outlining what needs to be built and how it might work, ideally with three main points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>. Follow with a high-level plan for sequencing, resourcing, and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.

Sharing this document openly and soliciting feedback, especially from engineering counterparts, is crucial for refining the strategy and building alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. The length of such a document can vary, potentially reaching 20 pages with detailed analysis and competitive screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. The primary purpose is for the PM to do their "homework" and gain confidence in their decisions, with a summary provided for quick consumption by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

## One-Pagers / Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)

The "one-pager" (also known as a spec or PRD) serves as the PM's core artifact for defining what a product team is building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Its effectiveness hinges on clearly articulating the "why."

### Key Sections of a One-Pager
*   **Background and Context:** The most critical section, answering:
    *   What is the problem? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>
    *   Why does it matter? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>
    *   Why does it matter *now*? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a> (This distinguishes urgent opportunities from ongoing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.)

The document should then become a central hub for decisions made and links to related artifacts like research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. It should be used to facilitate conversations and allow smart people to "poke holes" in the ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

Ramp, a finance automation platform and corporate card solution for small to medium-sized businesses, is known as the fastest-growing SaaS business in history, reaching over $100 million in annual run rate in two years, and then $200 million in run rate as a tech business faster than any other company [[00:00:54]]. Jeff Charles, VP of Product at Ramp, shares insights into the company's unique approach to product and its unprecedented [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth | growth]].

## Core Philosophy: Velocity

Velocity is the cornerstone of Ramp's operation, influencing its [[product_development_processes_at_ramp | product development processes]], team incentives, hiring, promotion, decision-making, and organizational structure [[00:07:30]]. This focus emerged during the pandemic when a small team faced a massive market opportunity, making execution speed paramount [[00:07:45]].

Velocity is seen as a metric for team performance, as high-velocity teams can achieve impact through continuous iteration [[00:08:12]]. It also attracts top [[hiring_and_developing_a_growth_team | talent]] who are drawn to companies that ship quickly [[00:08:20]]. Additionally, high velocity helps de-risk decisions because the cost of a poor decision is low if it can be quickly iterated on [[00:08:36]].

### Examples of Rapid Development
When Jeff Charles joined Ramp, the team was around 10 people with 8 engineers. In just three months, they built a competitor to MX, and six months later, a competitor to Expensify [[00:00:03]]. At that point, Ramp had already hit $100 million in annual revenue with fewer than 50 people in the R&D department (under 40 engineers and 3 Product Managers) [[00:09:23]]. Later, a team of three engineers, one designer, and one Product Manager built a competitor to Bill.com in three months for accounts payable, a product now processing billions of dollars annually [[00:09:35]].

## Operationalizing Velocity

Ramp achieves its remarkable speed through specific operational strategies:

### Single-Threaded Focus
Teams are designed to have a "single thread," meaning individuals focus on only one primary goal at a time [[00:10:57]]. This involves removing all other tasks or distractions, allowing them to concentrate solely on their core objective [[00:11:06]]. For instance, a team focused on an e-commerce "flex" product was kept purely on shipping that product to achieve its goal [[00:11:40]].

### Shielding Teams from Chaos
Ramp implements "layers of protective tissue" to safeguard core development teams from distractions and issues [[00:12:53]].
*   **Production Engineers** are on a rotational program, protecting the core team from escalations, bugs, and other production issues [[00:12:32]].
*   **Product Operators** shield Product Managers from administrative tasks like documentation, release management, enablement, and customer requests [[00:12:42]].
*   New product initiatives typically involve pulling individuals from different teams to form a dedicated sub-team without responsibilities for existing products, allowing them to focus entirely on the "zero to one" build [[00:13:00]].

### Lofty, Market-Driven Goals
Ramp sets ambitious goals by looking at publicly traded competitors like Bill.com and Expensify as market comparables, which provides strong motivation and de-risks business decisions [[00:13:55]]. Design also plays a crucial role in motivation; designers create "visionary prototypes" and "Cornerstone Loom walkthroughs" of future products, which constantly inspire teams [[00:14:26]]. Being a "revenue-driven company" keeps teams anchored on financial objectives [[00:15:03]].

### [[product_development_processes_at_ramp | Context Over Control]]
Ramp prioritizes providing context rather than micromanaging solutions [[00:15:25]]. Leaders ensure alignment on:
1.  The ultimate goal [[00:16:03]]
2.  The hypothesis for achieving that goal [[00:16:05]]
3.  The data supporting the hypothesis [[00:16:07]]
4.  The potential solution to test the hypothesis [[00:16:12]]

This approach emphasizes debating the upstream elements (data, hypotheses, goals) rather than just the solutions. This empowers teams closer to the ground to devise better solutions [[00:16:51]]. Leaders, like Jeff Charles, spend most of their time repeating core messages and sharing context from high-level meetings to help teams make informed decisions [[00:17:10]]. This means leaders act as "repeaters in chief," constantly reinforcing strategy and vision [[00:17:32]].

### Minimizing Bureaucracy and Meetings
Ramp aggressively cuts down on low-leverage work, especially meetings and status updates, which are seen as major time-wasters that demotivate people [[00:26:09]]. Status updates are handled asynchronously and in real-time within existing systems, not via dedicated meetings [[00:26:34]]. Meetings are reserved for collaboration, ideation, and decision-making [[00:26:44]].

### Clear Trade-offs and Focus
Leaders at Ramp are expected to clearly communicate the trade-offs of their choices to the leadership team [[00:27:29]]. By presenting a "menu of items" and explicitly stating what will *not* be done, teams can execute much faster on a focused set of priorities (e.g., four things instead of eight) [[00:27:40]]. This increases velocity by preventing scope creep and ensuring clarity.

### Quality Control and Accountability
Despite high velocity, Ramp maintains quality through specific control mechanisms:
*   **Voice of Customer:** Every negative product review is shared monthly with the tech lead, Product Manager, and designer responsible [[00:22:01]].
*   **NPS and CSAT:** These metrics are reported back to teams [[00:22:16]].
*   **Operational Overhead:** Teams are measured by the percentage of support tickets originating from their product area, normalized by user count. Maintaining a low operational burden is a core contract [[00:22:19]].
*   **Direct Bug Assignment:** Bugs are directly assigned to the engineer on call so they feel the immediate impact and leverage velocity to fix problems quickly [[00:22:37]].
*   **User Experience Metrics:** If support tickets due to customer confusion are elevated, teams are halted from shipping new features until these issues are resolved [[00:23:30]].
*   **No Bug Backlog:** Ramp aims to fix every bug as soon as it's surfaced, with production engineers responsible for immediate fixes [[00:23:06]].

## [[hiring_and_developing_a_growth_team | Hiring and Talent]]

Ramp's velocity is attributed less to culture *amplification* and more to the high quality of its engineering and design talent [[00:25:09]].
*   **Investment in R&D:** Ramp invests in R&D as a first-class citizen, paying top market rates to hire the best talent [[00:25:19]].
*   **Empowerment:** A culture of empowerment means the CEO sets the vision but is "much less opinionated about the specific sequence" of execution, trusting the empowered tech organization [[00:25:52]].
*   **Recruitment Focus:** They seek individuals who:
    *   Have a strong desire for impact [[00:06:08]].
    *   Want to win in the market and against competitors, caring about customer hearts and minds [[01:02:11]].
    *   Understand the business context and are curious about how the company operates, makes money, and what customers love [[01:02:27]].
    *   Are proactive, asking questions and solving problems outside their immediate domain (e.g., jumping into Slack channels to help users or fix bugs) [[01:03:14]].
    *   Can execute without constant oversight, setting the pace for Product Managers with their requests and actions [[01:02:48]].
    *   Possess a "desire to help, that desire to improve, that accountability on their product" [[01:03:59]].
*   **Interview Process:** Interview questions often explore "what's the hardest thing you've ever done" to assess a candidate's definition of difficulty, problem-solving approach, collaboration skills, and agency [[01:11:51]]. Ramp over-emphasizes hunger and the ability to think deeply over extensive prior experience, especially given its unique business model [[01:07:02]].

## Unique Aspects of Ramp's Strategy

### Thinking from First Principles
Given its unique business model (a credit card, payments, and software company serving both SMBs and Enterprise), Ramp emphasizes thinking from first principles rather than pattern matching from past experiences [[00:45:41]]. This requires hiring individuals who can set aside previous experience and delve deeply into fundamentals [[00:46:00]]. An example is the **Support Team reporting directly into Product** [[00:47:02]]. This decision stemmed from the principle that "every support ticket is a failure of our product" [[00:47:07]]. By having support report to product, the product team is held accountable for improving the product to reduce support tickets. This also fosters deep customer understanding and feedback implementation [[00:47:37]]. This first-principles approach led to a very low contact rate and an incredibly lean team of under 30 agents for over 400,000 users [[00:48:16]].

### The Product Manager Role
At Ramp, the Product Manager's core responsibilities are:
*   **Team Building:** Fostering a strong culture within their respective product pods, especially since engineers and designers often report to different managers [[01:00:31]]. This includes organizing off-sites and ideation sessions [[01:00:53]].
*   **Focus Areas:** Ensuring the team is productive and focused on the right areas [[01:01:04]].
*   **Stakeholder Protection:** Shielding the core team from external stakeholders who might seek updates or meetings, serving as the central point of contact to bring in the right people at the right time [[01:01:10]].
*   **Strategic Alignment:** Product Managers are accountable for ensuring their product roadmap aligns with the overall company goals [[01:00:01]]. Their contract with leadership is their strategy and roadmap, based on goals, hypotheses, data, initiatives, risks, and long-term outcomes [[00:38:10]].

The PM role at Ramp is not about writing detailed tickets or extensive project management. Instead, it's about defining the vision, priority, and high-level specifications, with much of the detailed work breakdown pushed onto the engineering teams [[00:59:31]]. This distributes the "PM job" across other team members, allowing the Product Managers to focus on higher-leverage activities like strategy and alignment [[01:00:11]].

## Personal Practices for Velocity (Jeff Charles)

Jeff Charles also employs personal strategies that mirror Ramp's overall velocity-driven culture:

*   **Writing to Think:** He uses writing to clarify complex problems and formulate his own thinking before seeking external answers [[00:49:02]]. This involves simply writing a question at the top of a paper and spending time thinking through the answer [[00:49:43]].
*   **Deep Work:** He blocks out dedicated time for deep work, often early mornings, late afternoons, or on weekends, to ensure uninterrupted thinking and problem-solving [[00:52:30]]. He has a policy of not being in the critical path of anything, ensuring he's not easily bugged [[00:53:41]].
*   **Robust Task Management:** He implements a simple yet robust task management system where he writes down all tasks owed and owed by others at the end of every meeting, then groups them logically (tactical vs. strategic, important vs. less important) [[00:54:55]]. He uses reminders to track tasks owed by others, freeing up his mental memory [[00:55:54]].
*   **Minimizing Notifications:** He advises turning off notifications, checking emails only once a day for a few minutes, and checking Slack only at the top of the hour to reduce distractions [[01:14:29]].
*   **Mastering Tools:** He emphasizes becoming highly proficient with core tools like Excel, calendars, Slack, and email to maximize efficiency [[01:15:05]].

## Conclusion

Ramp's rapid [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth | growth]] is a direct result of its dogmatic adherence to velocity, achieved through a unique combination of organizational design, empowering its A-plus [[hiring_and_developing_a_growth_team | talent]], and a steadfast commitment to thinking from first principles. This approach allows Ramp to be highly agile, responsive, and innovative, despite the inherent chaos of hypergrowth [[00:35:00]].

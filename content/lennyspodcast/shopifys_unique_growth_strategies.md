Shopify, a significant force in e-commerce, differentiates itself through an unconventional approach to product development and growth, largely driven by its long-term vision and unique business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Operating largely behind the scenes, Shopify facilitates approximately 10% of e-commerce in the United States and globally handled about $235 billion in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Core Growth Philosophy: The 100-Year Vision

Shopify's strategy is deeply rooted in a "100-year vision" set by CEO Tobi LÃ¼tke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, aiming to increase entrepreneurship on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. This long-term outlook influences all aspects of the business, including product development and capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:12:00">[44:12:00]</a>. The core principles emphasize building the best product in the world and making money to do more of the same, with a focus on long-term merchant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:30:00">[42:30:00]</a>.

### Prioritizing Absolute Numbers Over Rates
A key aspect of Shopify's growth philosophy is prioritizing absolute numbers of successful merchants over conversion rates or percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>. Teams are incentivized to increase the total number of people who complete a stage of the journey, rather than optimizing their local conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a>. This prevents the "seductive" trap of artificially inflating conversion rates by making preceding steps harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>. For example, making it easier to sign up might hurt the signup-to-activation conversion rate but will lead to more activated users overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>.

## Churn and Retention: A Different View

Unlike most companies that strive to minimize churn and maximize retention, Shopify's growth team operates with a unique perspective on churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Their primary goal is to lower barriers to entry for entrepreneurs, making it as easy as possible to start an online store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. While many businesses will fail, the company's revenue model, which derives most of its income from payments (tied directly to merchant success) rather than just subscriptions, means that a few highly successful merchants can offset the churn from many smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. This is likened to angel investing, where a few major successes make the entire portfolio worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

## Experimentation and Metrics

Shopify employs a sophisticated experimentation framework, focusing on long-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.

### Long-Term Holdouts
The company maintains long-term holdouts for nearly every experiment, revisiting their impact on the business a year, two years, or even three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. This allows them to see how changes affect long-term GMV and refine their understanding of input metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.
*   **Surprising Findings:** Approximately 30-40% of experiments that show a short-term lift in metrics (e.g., increased paying shops or first sales) show no incremental lift in long-term GMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>. This often indicates pulling forward success that would have happened anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:08:00">[38:08:00]</a>.
*   **Hidden Gems:** In some cases, experiments that show neutral or no short-term impact can have a massive positive impact on long-term GMV, by unlocking new, valuable merchant segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:47:00">[40:47:00]</a>.
*   **Shipping Neutral Experiments:** Shopify tends to ship experiments that show neutral short-term results if they have good intuition about its long-term potential for merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:21:00">[41:21:00]</a>.
*   **Attribution Challenges:** The shift to hybrid customer journeys (self-serve migrating to sales-assisted) broke traditional LTV and attribution models, necessitating a focus on incrementality testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.

### No KPIs for Core Product Teams
Uniquely, core product teams at Shopify do not have traditional Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or Objectives and Key Results (OKRs); these are "essentially banned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>. Decisions are based on "taste and intuition" and building towards the long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This allows them to take more risks and focus on foundational technical decisions that set the company up for long-term adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:06:00">[45:06:00]</a>. This approach requires an "opinionated founder" with strong taste and a small group of leaders to maintain a consistent quality bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:41:00">[59:41:00]</a>.

## Key Growth Levers

*   **Monetary Friction:** Reducing monetary friction, such as through trial dynamics, trial length, or incentives (e.g., app store credits), has been a significant driver of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>. This can unlock a class of entrepreneurs who might otherwise give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.
*   **Onboarding and Personalization:** Nailing the signup and onboarding flows by collecting the right information to personalize guidance and build trust has an enormous and lasting impact on long-term merchant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>.
*   **Technical Architecture as Strategy:** Shopify prioritizes how products are built, with the belief that technical architecture determines strategy in a technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:20:00">[45:20:00]</a>. This means sometimes taking longer to ship features to ensure the platform is adaptable and flexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:38:00">[45:38:00]</a>.

## Organizational Structure

Shopify's growth organization, led by the VP of Product and Head of Growth Archie Abrams, consists of over 600 people across various functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. It is primarily divided into two main groups:
1.  **Growth R&D:** Consists of product, design, engineering, and data teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Growth Products:** Focuses on the full customer lifecycle, from landing pages, signup, and onboarding, to monetization, trials, incentives, and merchant engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Platform (Tools/Enablement):** Builds internal tools for growth and other Shopify teams, including the experimentation platform, communication platform, business intelligence tooling, and marketing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:00">[30:57:00]</a>.
    *   **Customer Support Group:** Unusually, customer support sits within growth. This team builds tooling and creates self-serve experiences to ensure support is part of the merchant's journey to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:00">[31:17:00]</a>.
2.  **Growth Marketing:** Handles paid acquisition, media buying, affiliate marketing, email, content, and SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>. They drive traffic to the Shopify platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:00">[32:05:00]</a>.

## Cross-Functional Collaboration

Shopify maintains an intentional tension between its growth and core product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:49:00">[54:49:00]</a>. While core product focuses on long-term vision and "taste," growth aims to drive immediate numbers. This dynamic requires strong trust and open communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:35:00">[55:35:00]</a>. For example, growth might propose a feature like a "wizard" for onboarding that core product would reject due to a "no wizard principle." The teams then collaborate to achieve the *intent* of the growth idea (e.g., simplifying the product) while adhering to core product principles (e.g., integrating pre-filled sections directly into the product experience instead of a separate wizard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:19:00">[57:19:00]</a>.

## Sales and Hybrid Journeys

Shopify has layered on a sales motion to its historically [[productled_growth_strategies_at_figma | product-led growth]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>. Key learnings from integrating sales include:
*   **Qualitative Insights:** With larger customer scales, quantitative data is less useful; building qualitative insights and empathy with the sales team about merchant challenges is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Funnels:** Shopify is moving away from distinct self-service and sales funnels to create hybrid journeys where merchants can choose their preferred path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. This requires significant cultural resetting and rebuilding attribution models to properly value different touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
*   **Incrementality:** The goal is to move beyond multi-touch attribution to incrementality testing, which causally determines what drives an outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>.

## Marketing Structure

Shopify does not have a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. Instead, marketing leads are embedded directly within different parts of the organization:
*   Growth marketing sits within the growth team to focus on self-service motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>.
*   Revenue marketing works closely with sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
*   A brand team operates under the president, Harley Finkelstein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.
*   Product Marketing Managers (PMMs) are embedded with product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.
This structure ensures marketing is closely aligned with relevant outcomes and allows for faster movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>. Its success relies on the strong intuition of leaders like Toby and Harley regarding the brand's cohesive story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.

## Lessons from Discounting

Drawing from experience at Udemy, Archie Abrams highlights the power of discounting as a growth lever for marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. Discounting can:
*   **Signal Value:** A high list price signals high value, while a significant discount makes the product affordable and enticing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>.
*   **Tap into Aspiration:** In education, purchasing a course (even at a deep discount) can fulfill an emotional need for progress, leading to repeated engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>. This strategy allowed Udemy to achieve good retention by continually tapping into that emotional job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

In summary, Shopify's growth is driven by a unique blend of long-term vision, a tolerance for initial churn to enable more entrepreneurs, rigorous long-term experimentation, a focus on absolute growth rather than just rates, and an organizational structure that leverages leadership's taste and embedded teams.

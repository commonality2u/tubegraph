In the business-to-business (B2B) sales landscape, a significant challenge arises from customer indecision rather than direct competition. Approximately 40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes conclude with no decision being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon isn't primarily because the old solution is superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Instead, the majority of these indecisions stem from buyers' inability to confidently make a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. They often default to delaying the purchase, deferring it to a later time or year, as this is perceived as the safest, risk-free option for the person responsible for the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Why Buying is Hard (and Selling Needs to Adapt)

The act of buying software, particularly in B2B, can be more challenging than selling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Buyers are often under immense stress, with their job performance or even their position potentially at stake if they make a wrong choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. They are tasked by their superiors to find solutions, like a CRM, but are frequently overwhelmed by the sheer volume of options and the lack of a clear understanding of the market landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

Customers might research online, but they often lack a comprehensive understanding of:
*   Different approaches to a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   Where various products fit within those approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   What a good solution for *them* truly looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
*   Effective purchase criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

Sales processes often exacerbate this by presenting more features and information, further overwhelming the buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. This leads to paralysis, as buyers become more afraid of screwing up than of missing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>, often defaulting to the [[identifying_and_targeting_best_fit_customers | status quo]] or the market leader (e.g., "no one gets fired for buying Microsoft") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.

> [!INFO] The Jolt Effect
> Research from Matt Dixon's book, *The Jolt Effect*, which analyzed 2.5 million sales calls, indicates that attempting to induce "fear of missing out" (FOMO) in indecisive customers actually makes the situation worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. It adds more stress, leading to further paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. What *does* work is providing buyers with the tools and perspective needed to make an informed decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.

## A Framework for Teaching Customers How to Buy

Instead of just presenting product features, a sales pitch should adopt a teaching mindset, helping the buyer understand the market and confidently make a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

April Dunford's sales pitch framework is divided into two main parts:

### 1. The Setup
The setup phase is not about the vendor, but about the market and the vendor's point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This part should be conversational and act as a discovery process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

*   **Insight:** Start with a unique insight into the market or the problem that the product solves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This is essentially the vendor's point of view on the world, often rooted in why the product was built in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
    *   *Example (Help Scout):* Digital businesses view customer service as a growth driver, not merely a cost center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   **Alternative Approaches (Pros & Cons):** Paint a clear picture of the entire market by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of other solutions available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. This helps the buyer understand where your solution fits relative to competitors, even if they don't look exactly like your product (e.g., a shared inbox vs. a help desk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   It's important to be honest and even give credit where due to other approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>. This demonstrates calm confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.
*   **Perfect World Characteristics:** Conclude the setup by seeking agreement on the ideal characteristics of a solution for the buyer's specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This aligns the customer with your worldview, making them realize your solution is the ideal fit before you even introduce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.
    *   *Example (Help Scout):* Agree that an ideal solution would be as easy to use as a shared inbox, offer full features so they never outgrow it, and be built to deliver amazing customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### 2. The Follow-Through

Once alignment is achieved in the setup, the follow-through demonstrates how your product meets the agreed-upon perfect world criteria.

*   **Introduce Product/Market Category:** Briefly state what your product is and its market category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.
*   **[[interview_techniques_for_identifying_customer_needs | Differentiated Value]] (Features + "So What"):** Instead of just listing features, explain the *value* those features deliver, specifically the value that no other solution can provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Link each feature to its unique benefit.
    *   *Example (LevelJump):* Feature: Built on Salesforce. Value: Sales enablement data is integrated with sales data, allowing measurement of ramp time improvement, leading to faster revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   **Proof:** Provide evidence that your product can deliver on its claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This often comes in the form of customer case studies or independent third-party verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>.
*   **Handle Objections (Optional):** Proactively address common silent objections that may arise (e.g., "too hard to adopt," "too expensive," "security concerns") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. This shows foresight and helps the "champion" (the main buyer) overcome internal hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.
*   **The Ask:** Clearly state the desired next steps in the sales process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## Navigating the Buying Team

In B2B, typical purchase processes involve 5 to 7 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.
*   **The Champion:** This is the primary buyer who does the initial research, makes the shortlist, and sits on early calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Your pitch must resonate deeply with them, as they are the gatekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.
*   **Other Stakeholders:** These individuals (e.g., IT, finance) cannot make a deal happen but can kill it in many ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. Sales needs to equip the champion to handle their potential objections (e.g., security, integration, budget, ease of adoption) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. This means providing them with an understanding of typical purchase processes and the information needed for each department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.

## Category Creation vs. Bowling Pin Strategy

While some advocate for category creation as the only path to a legendary business, it's often an exception rather than the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. Many successful companies start as a niche play within an existing category, making it easier for customers to understand what they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.

The **Bowling Pin Strategy** (coined by Jeffrey Moore) is a common approach:
1.  **Define a niche:** Target a segment of the market underserved by the current leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
2.  **Dominate the niche:** Become the leader in that specific segment (the "lead pin") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>.
3.  **Expand strategically:** Leverage that beachhead to expand into adjacent segments ("the three pins beside it") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.

This strategy helps customers understand your offering by framing it within an existing, known category, then gradually expanding their understanding as you grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

## Implementing and Measuring Success

To implement this framework:
1.  **Cross-Functional Alignment:** The [[building_a_successful_sales_team | sales]] pitch is a direct reflection of a company's [[how_to_conduct_willingness_to_pay_conversations | product positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A strong sales pitch requires deeply understanding your [[interview_techniques_for_identifying_customer_needs | differentiated value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. This is best achieved when product, marketing, and sales teams collaborate on defining this value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. Marketing often stewards the positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
2.  **Pilot Testing:** Do not simply "heave" a new pitch over to the sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>. Instead, work with your best sales representative to train them on the new pitch, have them test it with qualified prospects, and iterate based on feedback after each pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.
3.  **Rollout:** Once the best rep is confident the new pitch is superior (they'll likely refuse to go back to the old one), film them, and have them train the rest of the sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. This peer-to-peer training is highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Timeframe
> Refining positioning can take about a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. Developing and testing the sales pitch can be done in a couple of weeks to a month, depending on the volume of qualified prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>.

The impact of this approach is often seen as an immediate uplift in sales metrics. Companies have reported doubling the number of deals converting from a first sales call to an opportunity simply by refining their pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. This is a low-hanging fruit, especially in challenging economic times, to extract more value from the sales pipeline by ensuring customers understand your value and why they should choose you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.

## Contrasting with Trend-Based Pitches

Some sales approaches start with a broad market trend, then discuss who will win and lose from this shift, before introducing the product. However, this method has limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>:
*   **Lacks Differentiated Value:** It assumes "new" is inherently valuable and "old" is inherently bad, which isn't always true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>. It fails to explain what makes *your* new solution uniquely better than other new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>.
*   **Trends Aren't Unique:** Market trends are often observable by everyone, including competitors, making it hard to differentiate your opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.
*   **Focus on Future vs. Present:** This approach is more suited for investor pitches (talking about 10-year market disruptions) rather than sales pitches, which require immediate relevance and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. Focusing too much on future trends can give indecisive customers another reason to delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>.

The goal is to be useful to the customer, helping them navigate a complex decision-making process by providing clarity, context, and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>.

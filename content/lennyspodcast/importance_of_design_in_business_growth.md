The concept of "beauty" in business and product development has seen a dramatic decrease in usage in digitized books over time, aligning with the idea that "functionality is King" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, this perspective often wrongly positions functionality and beauty as opposing forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. In reality, beauty enhances functionality by making products easier to use, more approachable, and more compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Business Value of Beauty and Quality

Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe, emphasizes that beauty is not separate from functionality; it actively contributes to business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

Key benefits of integrating beauty and quality into product design include:
*   **Increased Trust** Beautifully designed products communicate painstaking detail and care, assuring users that the company cares about other, less visible details, thereby increasing trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Usability and Desirability** Beauty makes things easier to use, more accessible, and leads to better user outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. This means a more enjoyable and user-centric experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **"Beauty Begets Beauty"** High-quality design inspires similar attention to detail from users and partners, reflecting positively on the company's care and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   **Pride and Talent Attraction** Pursuing quality and beauty fosters a sense of pride within the team, making the company a more attractive place for talented individuals who care about their craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

### Quality as Growth

A critical insight is that quality is not separate from growth; it directly drives it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
When products are easier to use and more understandable, it naturally encourages more people to use them and use them more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

Stripe's growth team, for example, is intensely focused on building better experiences because it directly ties to business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **Onboarding Flow Improvements**: Enhancing the onboarding experience to make products easier to understand has led to increased activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Checkout Experience**: Research on top e-commerce sites revealed that 99% had errors in their checkout flow hindering seamless transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. By maniacally focusing on improving the checkout experience through design details, Stripe saw a **10.5% increase in businesses' revenue** when moving from older to newer checkout forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. This demonstrates a direct [[quality_improvement_leading_to_business_impact | business impact]] from quality improvements.

> "I think it's actually a false belief that you know it's like one or the other it's like are we going to work on quality and it doesn't move the metrics." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>

### Levels of Quality
Quality exists on a spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>:
1.  **Baseline**: The product works and provides value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
2.  **Error-Free**: The product performs exceedingly well and is well-rounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
3.  **Exceeding Expectations**: The product does something the user wasn't even seeking, often surpassing user expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

Companies that consider quality non-negotiable understand that it is fundamental to features and leads to great usability and desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This is analogous to working out: consistent effort adds up to better long-term outcomes, even if a single session doesn't show immediate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Operationalizing Quality and Design

Achieving great design requires a concerted, ongoing effort, as there's a natural "gravitational pull to mediocrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.

Stripe's approach to operationalizing [[design_and_innovation_in_software_development | design and innovation]] and quality includes:
1.  **Group Effort**: Quality is a collective responsibility, not just one person's or one team's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Internal standards and communication are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Vision and Alignment**: Even with talented people, a shared vision is necessary to ensure individual contributions coalesce into a coherent, high-quality whole, similar to how an architect ensures all parts of a house fit together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.
3.  **Editing**: Having an "editor" or a lead with the ability to narrow, reduce, and remove elements that don't fit the overall vision is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
4.  **Courage**: Leaders must possess the courage to say "no, this isn't good enough" even when teams have put significant effort into something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
5.  **User-Centric Understanding**: Quality must be understood from the user's perspective, considering their entire journey, not just isolated product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

### "Walk the Store" Process
To combat quality regression over time, Stripe implemented a "Walk the Store" program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.
*   **Focus on Journeys**: 15 critical user journeys are identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
*   **Cross-Functional Ownership**: Each journey has dedicated engineering, product, and [[design_and_innovation_in_software_development | design]] leaders responsible for its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.
*   **Regular Review**: These leaders regularly "friction log" their experiences as if they were users, noting what works and what doesn't, from initial search to dashboard interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   **Scoring and Calibration**: Teams score the quality of their journeys using a rubric focused on usability, utility, and desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. These scores are then calibrated in multidisciplinary "product quality review" (PQR) meetings to ensure a shared understanding of the quality bar across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.
*   **Impact**: This process increases awareness and accountability, highlights upstream impacts (e.g., how SEO affects later stages of a journey), and fosters a company-wide commitment to quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. It validates personal judgment in addition to data and user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.

### Fighting the Fear of Bold Ideas
Companies often exhibit a "fear of bold ideas," preferring incremental changes that are easier to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. However, focusing only on small, measurable improvements within limited scopes can prevent making the entire user experience better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

Dill advocates for "reach for the stars and land on the Moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.
*   **Vision Work**: This involves sketching out the ideal, comprehensive "11-star experience" (as coined by Brian Chesky of Airbnb) for the entire user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.
*   **Strategic Incrementation**: While the vision is grand, the implementation can be iterative, shipping smaller pieces to learn and gather data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. This North Star approach ensures that incremental steps lead towards a cohesive, impactful long-term outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

## Building and Scaling Design Teams

### Performance Formula
Katie Dill uses the formula: **Performance = Potential - Interference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.
*   **Increase Potential**: Achieved through strong hiring, talent development, and growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>.
*   **Decrease Interference**: Removing obstacles that hinder great work, such as outdated processes, misalignment, or poor collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

### Combating Information Silos
As companies grow, people can lose touch with what's happening across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.
*   **Visual Sharing**: Design teams at Stripe, and previously at Airbnb, regularly share screenshots or prototypes of their work in a shared deck (like Google Slides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. This allows designers to see what others are building and identify opportunities for collaboration or consistent patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>. It also provides product managers, engineering leaders, and other company leaders with a clear visual overview of ongoing development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. This helps [[understanding_the_challenges_of_developing_effective_business_strategies | align strategy]] and prevents redundant work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.

### Reorganizing for Collaboration
At Lyft, Dill faced a situation where the design team was physically separated from engineering and product, leading to wasted work and misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. While this dedicated "creative space" had benefits, it created interference.
The solution was to physically and organizationally integrate design with their cross-functional partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>. Designers were embedded within product teams (e.g., working on driver, rider, or safety teams) and sat alongside their respective engineers and product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. This fostered faster iteration cycles and clearer understanding of shared goals, while still maintaining dedicated creative spaces for specific design activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. This reflects [[creative_approaches_to_building_beloved_b2b_products | creative approaches to building products]] and [[challenges_with_rebranding_and_redesigning_for_growth | rebranding and redesigning for growth]].

### Hiring for Design
When hiring designers, prioritize:
*   **Taste and Character**: These are harder to teach than tools or processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>. Look for a natural inclination towards great things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.
*   **Humility**: A humble designer is more attuned to user needs and curious about improving the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>.
*   **Hustle/Courage**: The act of creation is inherently scary. Look for individuals who have the courage to propose new ideas and fight for excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

For startups, while a "doer" is often needed initially, it's also important to have a strategic mindset. This might mean hiring a senior design advisor alongside a full-time executor to ensure a user-focused approach from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>, relating to [[creative_branding_strategies_for_startups | creative branding strategies for startups]].

## Design as Intention

Ultimately, design is about intentionality – making deliberate decisions by thinking about who the product is for and how it impacts them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. This applies to anything from designing a doorknob to an organizational structure or a business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>. While design expertise brings creativity and taste, anyone can bring more care and intentionality to their work, leading to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>. This perspective aligns with principles of [[game_design_in_business_software | game design in business software]] and the [[importance_of_storytelling_in_business_communication | importance of storytelling]].

Stripe itself embodies this commitment to design beyond its core financial infrastructure products, notably through Stripe Press. They print books that embody "ideas of progress" and apply meticulous care to their creation, viewing them as an extension of their mission to increase the GDP of the internet, showing their identity and care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>. This commitment to quality, even in non-core areas, reinforces their brand and user perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

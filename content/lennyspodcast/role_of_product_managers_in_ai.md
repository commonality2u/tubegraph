The [[the_role_of_ai_in_product_management | role of product managers in AI]] is undergoing a significant transformation, moving beyond traditional product development to embrace the unique challenges and opportunities presented by rapidly evolving AI capabilities. This shift demands new skills, a deeper understanding of technology, and adaptability to non-deterministic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Unique [[challenges_and_advantages_of_ai_in_product_management | Challenges of AI Product Management]]

The [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | impact of AI on product management]] introduces complexities not typically found in traditional roles:
*   **Ever-changing Technology Base** Historically, product development builds upon a relatively fixed technology base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. In AI, however, "every two months computers can do something computers have never been able to do before," constantly altering the product landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This requires continuous adaptation and re-evaluation of product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Emergent Capabilities** New models often exhibit "emergent property" capabilities that are not fully known even by research teams during training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Product managers might discover unexpected abilities or need to wait to understand the reliability (e.g., 60% vs. 90% vs. 99% good) of a model's performance to design appropriate product experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Stochastic and Non-Deterministic Systems** Unlike deterministic software, AI models are stochastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This means the same input may not yield the exact same output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. This nature makes product design more complex, requiring PMs to consider feedback mechanisms, guardrails, and graceful failure states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Enterprise vs. Consumer Products** AI companies often serve consumer, enterprise, and developer products simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Enterprise sales cycles are much longer, involving buyers with specific goals that may not directly align with end-user satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## New Core Skills for AI Product Managers

The [[impact of AI on product management]] necessitates the development of specialized skills for PMs:

### Writing Evaluations (Evals)
A critical skill for AI product managers is the ability to write effective evaluations (evals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Gating Quality:** The quality of an AI-powered feature is directly tied to how well PMs define and conduct evals and prompt engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. This is because models are often "eval limited" rather than "intelligence limited," meaning they could perform better with proper guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Learning from Models:** PMs can use the models themselves to learn how to write good evals and generate sample evaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Intuition:** Building intuition for evals requires "looking at data" and understanding where models succeed or fail, even challenging initial grading if it doesn't align with observed behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
*   **Future of Evals:** As models handle more long-form, ambiguous tasks (e.g., getting a hotel in New York), evals will become "much softer" and might resemble performance reviews rather than binary right/wrong assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This is complicated by models potentially outperforming human evaluators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

### Prototyping with Models
AI product managers should be proficient in prototyping using AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Iteration:** By prompting models to generate UI variations or compare different UI approaches, PMs can prototype a "far greater variety" of designs and evaluate them on a much faster scale than traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

### Deeper Technical Understanding
The [[impact of AI on product development]] pushes PMs to delve deeper into the technology stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. While not requiring them to be researchers, an appreciation for the underlying mechanisms, language, and intuition about how models work is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

## Product Development Cycles with AI

The development cycle in AI is characterized by collaboration and constant discovery:
*   **Co-design and Co-research:** Product and research teams engage in co-design, co-research, and co-fine-tuning efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. The outcome of these partnerships is often demos or informative insights that spark product ideas, rather than predictable, derisked product outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Iterative Improvement:** When models are, for example, "60% good" at a task, product design must account for this by incorporating a "human in the loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Examples like GitHub Copilot demonstrate how even imperfect AI can be valuable by saving time and effort, with humans refining the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Educating End Users

AI products are adopted at an incredibly rapid pace, forcing a quick adaptation from users who are accustomed to deterministic computer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
*   **Rapid Adaptation:** Users quickly grow accustomed to "magic" AI experiences; what was mind-blowing two years ago (e.g., GPT 3.5) now feels primitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
*   **Educational Product Design:** Products themselves are becoming educational tools, with AI models explicitly telling users how to use features or providing links to documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Power Users:** In enterprise settings, power users often become evangelists, creating custom AI applications (like custom GPTs) to make AI accessible and valuable for less technical users within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

## The [[the_future_of_product_management_in_the_ai_era | Future of Product Management in the AI Era]]

The [[building_a_career_in_ai_product_management | future of product management in the AI era]] will be shaped by several key trends:
*   **Proactivity:** Models will become more proactive, monitoring user data (with authorization) to offer timely insights, prepare for meetings, or even draft presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
*   **Asynchronous Interaction:** AI will enable more asynchronous interactions, where models work on complex, longer-horizon tasks (e.g., a "mini project plan" or fixing a bug) over extended periods, allowing users to return when complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.
*   **Multi-modal Interaction:** Models will interact in all human-like ways, including speech, vision, and other modalities. Universal translators, enabling seamless communication across languages, are already a reality and will become commonplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.
*   **Orchestration of Models:** Product managers will orchestrate workflows between multiple models, leveraging each model for its specific strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. This mimics how humans with diverse skill sets collaborate to achieve complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.
*   **Model Personality and Relationships:** The "personality of the model" will become a crucial product consideration, with users developing "two-way empathy" and even befriending the AI, leading to questions about model customization and user preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

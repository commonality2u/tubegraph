Amy Vora, Chief Product Officer at Fair, is recognized as a leader in the tech industry, having previously held significant roles at Meta, including Head of Product for Facebook's global ads business and leading product and design for WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Despite her impressive career, Vora advocates for authenticity, emphasizing that individuals can be "pretty messy and imperfect at times yet still be very successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

## Challenging the "Superwoman" Myth

Vora openly shares her perspective on the perceived image of successful women in tech, often depicted as "superwomen" who seemingly have everything figured out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This image, she notes, can make others feel that success is unattainable if they don't fit the mold of someone who responds to every email in seconds, doesn't sleep, and always appears perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

Amy Vora herself acknowledges her own "imperfections," such as enjoying sleep, wasting time on absurd things, and even working from her bathroom due to family and remote work constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Her realization that "no one's got it fully figured out" and that most people are "winging it and learning as we're going" has been a crucial insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Her approach to career growth has been less about a rigid plan and more about following what "feels right," working with people who feel like friends, and being in a place where she can be creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This emphasizes a more human, less prescriptive path to [[Becoming a successful individual contributor in tech | success]].

## Navigating Feedback and Professional Growth

Vora highlights how traditional feedback can sometimes present unique challenges for women in tech.

### Sublimating Ego and Cultivating Curiosity

A key aspect of Vora's professional growth, as noted by Meta's CTO Bos, is her ability to approach profound disagreements with genuine curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. Instead of reacting defensively, she would respond with "fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. This approach allowed her to tear down walls between different points of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

Vora admits that this did not come naturally; she initially "really enjoy[ed] being right" and built part of her identity on knowing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. However, she learned that this didn't serve her well in the working world, as it meant ignoring valuable information from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. Her turning point was recognizing that "it's more important to get to the outcome than to be right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>. This shift fosters a positive feedback loop, leading to better outcomes and more learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. The phrase "fascinating, you have to tell me more" is a key takeaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

### The "Likability" Trap and Expanding Toolsets

Vora received challenging feedback in her career, suggesting that despite her intelligence, her "likability" impacted her effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:27:00">[48:27:00]</a>. In response, she initially tried to "shrink herself," becoming less aggressive and opinionated, even wearing "earth tones for like two years" to fade into the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:57:00">[48:57:00]</a>. While this seemed to "work for a long time" in making people more likely to work with her, it eventually hindered her ability to lead when her team needed her opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:08:00">[49:08:00]</a>.

Her learned approach to such feedback is not to diminish oneself but to "expand your tool sets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:51:00">[50:51:00]</a>. This means building "new keys to unlock new different kinds of doors," which ultimately makes an individual "bigger and more powerful and more expansive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:51:00">[50:51:00]</a>.

## Reevaluating Traditional Advice: Mentors and Sponsors

Vora offers a "hot take" on advice often given to women in tech regarding finding mentors and sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:08:00">[54:08:00]</a>. She views this as "yet another set of hoops" that women are often told to jump through, unlike other demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:12:00">[54:12:00]</a>. This advice, she argues, can become an added "burden" if it implies that success is contingent on finding a perfect oracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:36:00">[54:36:00]</a>. While grateful for the generosity of leaders who helped her, she didn't feel she had "this mentor" and realized she "had everything [she] needed" without fitting this specific narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:49:00">[54:49:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Aspiring Women in Tech

Amy Vora's overarching advice for aspiring women in tech, particularly those starting in product, is:
*   **"Don't dampen who you are and your strengths"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:38:00">[55:38:00]</a>.
*   **"Just continue expanding whenever you run into a problem, just add more to the things that you can do, the tools that you have, the way you can express yourself"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:41:00">[55:41:00]</a>.
*   **"Just keep on adding and growing and don't like shrink yourself ever"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:00">[55:50:00]</a>.

Additionally, she emphasizes the importance of staying connected to the customer, as "it's such a shortcut to everything else you need to do in order to be successful" and leads to greater personal happiness and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27">[01:15:27]</a>. She believes that long-term customer value and company value are rarely adversarial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>.

[[AI and software development | AI]] is described as "the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Its rapid advancement is prompting companies to re-evaluate workforce structures and job roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Rebalancing the Workforce
Companies are beginning to rebalance their workforces in response to [[AI and software development | AI]]'s capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. For instance, Salesforce is seeing a reduced need for support engineers due to the efficiency of its robotic support layer, Agent Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. This layer has enabled the company to resolve 83% of inquiries robotically and cut human escalations by 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

However, while some roles may decrease, others are expanding. Salesforce plans to hire 1,000 to 2,000 additional account executives specifically to focus on Agent Force, indicating a shift in demand towards sales and distribution for new [[AI and software development | AI]] products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. The company aims to become a "digital labor provider," not just a data manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.

## [[AI in financial services | AI]]'s Role in Healthcare
In healthcare, [[AI and software development | AI]] and agents can significantly reduce manual tasks that contribute to staff burnout, such as scheduling and routine communication with patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. This automation could free up medical professionals to focus on more complex, empathetic patient interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. Research suggests that [[AI and software development | AI]], like Chat GPT, can sometimes offer more accurate diagnoses than doctors due to less bias, indicating a potential shift in medical processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

## Differentiated [[Impact of AI on startups and business practices | Impact]]
The [[impact of AI on startups and business practices | impact]] of [[AI and software development | AI]] on jobs is expected to vary significantly depending on the industry and geographic location. While highly digitized sectors in large cities like San Francisco may see considerable job impacts, blue-collar jobs in smaller towns, such as those in restaurants, trucking, supermarkets, construction, and gardening, are anticipated to be affected much later, if at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. This suggests a "Tale of Two Cities" scenario where different regions experience distinct rates of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.

## Adapting to Change
For entrepreneurs, the mindset towards new technologies like agents should be one of anticipation rather than resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. Embracing continuous improvement, or "Kaizen," is essential in an industry where technology is constantly becoming lower cost, easier to use, and more automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. The goal is to "get to the future first and welcome our customers there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

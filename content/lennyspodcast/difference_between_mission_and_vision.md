In the realm of [[Product Strategy and Vision Development | product strategy]], distinguishing between a mission and a vision is crucial for aligning teams and achieving success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Ab Atod, Director of Product Management at YouTube, emphasizes that having a vision is essential regardless of one's level within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Mission

A mission defines the fundamental purpose of an organization or team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. It answers "why we exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

*   **Purpose-driven:** It clarifies the reason for the company's or team's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Guiding principles:** It includes a set of guiding principles that allow the team to achieve their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Internal motivation:** It's the core reason individuals work for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   **Uber:** Initially, "push a button, get a ride, transportation as reliable as running water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Later, a more inclusive version: "reliable transport sanitation everywhere and for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **TED:** To spread ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Stripe:** Increase the GDP of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Ikea:** Create a better everyday life for many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Vision

A vision paints a picture of the desired future state once the mission is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. It's "what it looks like when you get there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

*   **Lofty:** It should be aspirational and exciting, almost a little scary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Realistic and Attainable:** While lofty, it shouldn't feel completely out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Devoid of Current Limitations:** It should be imagined without being constrained by today's technical or resource limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. This allows for future innovation to overcome current hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Grounded in a Problem:** A strong vision stems from a clear, potent problem that people are excited to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   **Uber:** A world with a continuous trip where parking is no longer needed, freeing up city spaces for housing, restaurants, or parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This vision led to initiatives like Uber Pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Tesla:** Getting to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Microsoft:** A computer on every desk and in every home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **Lyft:** A world where cities feel small again, and transportation and tech bring people together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

## [[Developing a Product Vision Framework | Developing a Vision]]

The process of developing a vision involves three main steps:

1.  **Empathize:** Deeply understand the customer and the problem space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.
    *   **"Understand Work":** Actively use your own product (dog fooding) and competitors' products (cat fooding) to build intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
    *   **Research:** Use research to identify foundational problems, not just to dictate solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. Your gut instinct and product sense are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
    *   **"Top 10 Things You Should Know" Document:** Create a living document listing the top 10 most impactful problems (qualitative, quantitative, tech debt, etc.) that the team should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This document should be updated quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. Stakeholders (marketing, operations, support, research, content strategy) can contribute to this list, helping to gain buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.
    *   **Strategic Sessions:** Dedicate time (e.g., three-day workshops) with product, engineering, design, and research leaders to dive deep into these problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.

2.  **Create:** Based on the identified problems, articulate the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. This is where the [[Crafting a Compelling Product Vision | storytelling]] comes in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

3.  **Evangelize:** Continuously communicate and gain buy-in for the vision across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.
    *   **Concentric Circles:** Start with the core team, then move to stakeholders (adjacent teams, managers), and finally, leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Transparency:** Share the vision document with comments open for feedback, allowing "friction" to polish the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.
    *   **Persistence:** Evangelization requires patience, as naysayers and technical limitations will be encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

## [[Crafting a Compelling Product Vision | Communicating Vision]]

Vision can be communicated in various concrete ways:

*   **Storytelling Framework ("Mad Libs"):** A simple narrative structure: "Once Upon a Time [problem occurred], and because of that [impact], and one day [big change happened], and as a result [new world state/feeling]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   **News Article:** Write a headline and subtitle (or a full article) as if it were a future TechCrunch or Verge announcement about the product's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This forces clarity and focuses on the ultimate impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Visual Mocks/Sketches:** Draw or mock up what the future product looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. This could be a detailed design, simple hand-drawn sketches on Post-it notes, or even screenshots of a hypothetical app store listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Designers are powerful allies in this, but PMs should initiate sketching even without design resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## Longevity and Scope

A true vision is a [[Longterm vision and future casting in business strategy | long-term]] commitment, typically lasting at least three to five years, or even longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. It should not be repeated or drastically changed every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. Instead, "micro-visions" can exist for smaller, shorter-term problems, often manifested as mocks of next year's solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

## Connection to [[Building Strategy Skills and Effective Goals | Product Management Craft]]

The essence of the product management craft is **Clarity and Conviction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
*   **Clarity:** Involves distilling complexity, understanding problems, and defining a clear narrative for "why we exist" and "what we're doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>. This clarity helps save cycles and focus efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.
*   **Conviction:** Is the "feeling of what you think the world should be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. It's about having a strong belief in the chosen path and being able to defend it, even under scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>. It requires PMs to make tough choices and avoid spreading resources too thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

The product manager's role is to bring this clarity and conviction, acting as a curator of problems and a storyteller of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

## Impact on Product Culture

Company culture significantly influences how products are built.
*   **Uber's Culture:** Focused on autonomy, principal confrontation, and "toe-stepping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. This allowed for aggressive experimentation and localized innovation, leading to a product that adapted to diverse cities (e.g., cash payments in Nigeria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. However, a monolithic culture that didn't intentionally evolve led to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.
*   **Netflix's Culture:** Rooted in "freedom and responsibility" and "highly aligned, loosely coupled" principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. This culture encouraged structured debates, allowing for significant product shifts like introducing advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.
*   **Google's Culture:** Characterized by a "looser macro culture" with distinct "micro-cultures" across different product areas (e.g., Search, Assistant, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. This flexibility allows different product philosophies to coexist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.

Product leaders should actively [[Building Strategy Skills and Effective Goals | build a strong product culture]] within their teams, fostering a sense of ownership ("owner, not a renter") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:42">[02:08:42]</a>, clear decision-making ("informed captain") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:55">[02:09:55]</a>, and mutual care and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>. This allows for constructive feedback and collaborative product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:50">[02:13:50]</a>.

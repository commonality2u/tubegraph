Setting up effective sales compensation and quotas is a critical aspect of [[building_a_sales_team_in_b2b_saas | building a sales team]]. Many founders and executives make consistent mistakes in this area, but with the right approach, it can lead to profitable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## General Principles

Sales compensation plans should be designed as a win-win for both the company and the sales representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. If a salesperson earns a high income, the company should also be generating significant revenue, creating a positive feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

## Compensation Structure

When structuring compensation for early sales hires:

*   **Pay Market Rate** It is crucial to pay market rate for sales talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. Founders often panic at the perceived high total compensation (On-Target Earnings or OTE) for a sales representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. For example, a rep might ask for $150,000 OTE, which is typically split 50% base salary and 50% bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This means the upfront cash commitment is primarily the base salary, which is more manageable in the early months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>.
*   **Initial Bonus Structure** For the first three months, it's advisable for new sales representatives to keep 100% of what they close in commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. This acts as an initial investment in the rep and motivates them by allowing them to put "supper on the stove" immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. This incentivizes them and helps them feel successful early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. This ramp should ideally last for one quarter maximum; making it too easy for too long can encourage mediocre performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Profitability** Ultimately, a sales representative should bring in revenue that is 3 to 5 times what they take home in total compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
    *   For small businesses, this multiple is around 3x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.
    *   For mid-market, it's about 4x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.
    *   For Enterprise, it's around 5x or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
    If this ratio is achieved, the sales rep should be accretive to the business, meaning they generate more revenue than their cost, assuming marketing costs are reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>.

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

*   **Don't Over-Optimize Early On:** In the early stages, focusing too much on tweaking compensation plans is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. The priority is to ensure the sales rep closes more than they cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. Negotiating down a $150k OTE to $130k, for example, makes little difference if the goal is for them to close $600k-$700k in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   **Allow Sales Reps to Earn:** Founders should not be upset if their sales representatives make a lot of money, even more than the founders themselves in the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>. If the compensation plan is structured correctly, high earnings for the sales team mean high revenue for the company, increasing the value of the founders' equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** If the compensation plan is well-engineered, it shouldn't need frequent revisions for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. Constant changes can lead to a "leaky boat" scenario, burning through cash without solid returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

## Quota Setting and Performance

*   **Initial Quota:** For the first three months, it's a win if a new rep closes as much as their take-home pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. Don't put pressure on them to close 5x their earnings in the first quarter; let them close 1x and build momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.
*   **Leverage for Founders:** Once a founder is spending more than 20% of their time on sales, they need leverage by hiring their first sales representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Hiring Two Reps:** It's recommended to hire two sales representatives initially to create an A/B test for human performance and avoid blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Concentrate Leads:** In the early days, it's better to have fewer, high-performing reps closing substantial deals rather than many struggling ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. Concentrate leads with your best closers to ensure strong performance and build internal expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.
*   **Sales Productivity:** The optimal number of direct reports for a sales manager (and other functions) is often based on "rules of eight" (e.g., eight SDRs per manager, eight Account Executives per director) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. This ensures effective management and prevents burnout for managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

## Impact on Business Model

The way sales are compensated and quotas are set directly impacts the overall business.

*   **CAC and Payback Period:** If sales reps are not closing deals or if marketing costs are too high, the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and payback period will break, leading to financial strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.
*   **Annual Contracts:** While switching to annual contracts might look good on a spreadsheet for investors, it can be detrimental to the customer experience, especially for smaller businesses and individual users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. Forcing customers to pay annually when they prefer monthly can increase churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>.
*   **Product-Led Growth (PLG) and Freemium:** For [[transitioning_to_productled_sales | product-led growth]] or freemium models, churn is a critical metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. Product teams, along with founders, should be the "voice of the customer" to prioritize long-term customer satisfaction and reduce churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:34">[01:33:34]</a>. While sales and marketing teams focus on monetization, someone needs to champion the "free" user base to foster long-term advocacy and compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.

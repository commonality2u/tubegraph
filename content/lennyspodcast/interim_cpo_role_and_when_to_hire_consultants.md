Melissa Perri, a product management expert, has worked with over 4,000 product managers and more than 30 companies through deep consulting engagements, including serving in interim CPO roles and teaching at Harvard Business School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Her extensive experience provides unique insights into the common challenges product teams face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## When to Hire Consultants or an Interim CPO

Organizations often mistakenly believe their issues stem from a lack of training for their people, when in fact, 99% of the time, the problem lies in how they are setting goals and deploying strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Without proper strategic context, training alone is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. When undergoing transformations or establishing a product organization, a holistic approach is required, which may necessitate bringing in an expert or being prepared to act when external help arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

A company might need to bring in someone like Melissa Perri, either for an interim CPO role or general consulting, when a CEO is uncertain about the right person to hire for a product leadership position, or they don't understand the function of a product person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Perri helps CEOs understand how a product partner can alleviate challenges and allow them to focus on vision and fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

Common scenarios indicating a need for external help include:
*   **Lack of Strategic Clarity** Executives or the board express ignorance about what's happening in tech or product, indicating poor communication from leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Disconnected Teams** Product teams are working hard but metrics aren't moving, and executives don't understand how the teams' work contributes to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   **Absence of Clear Strategy** There's no formalized, communicated strategy, leading to different answers across the organization when asked about goals or vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Hiring Difficulties** If there's trouble [[effective_hiring_and_firing_strategies | hiring product managers]], it suggests a need for a [[role_and_importance_of_chief_product_officers | CPO]] who can offer learning opportunities and mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Scaling Challenges** High-growth SaaS companies transitioning from single to multi-product, managing complex portfolios, or rapidly scaling often need external guidance to rethink and prioritize their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### The Interim CPO Role

An interim CPO steps in to bridge a leadership gap, particularly during high-growth phases or significant company transformations (e.g., mergers, drastic market expansion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This role is typically temporary, with the goal of installing a permanent [[role_and_importance_of_chief_product_officers | Chief Product Officer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

The objective of an interim CPO engagement is to get in and out as fast as possible, usually within three months, during which a permanent CPO is hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. During this period, the interim CPO:
*   Keeps the company on track for delivery and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   Ensures teams have enough roadmap to continue working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   Helps implement some processes and provides initial training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
*   Gathers crucial information (customer background, current strategy, roadmap, customer interviews) to enable the incoming permanent CPO to hit the ground running and build a long-term strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

### Expectations When Hiring a Consultant

A consultant can only help when the company is willing to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This may involve drastic changes, including reorganizing the team or making hard decisions about talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. Consultants cannot implement changes themselves; their role is to provide choices and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

Many organizations hire consultants but then fail to follow their advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. The most successful engagements occur when the company is prepared to re-evaluate its strategy and make necessary adjustments based on the consultant's expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

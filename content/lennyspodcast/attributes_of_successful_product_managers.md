Maggie Crowley, VP of Product at Toast, has identified three common threads among the best product managers she has worked with, hired, and managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. These attributes are consistent regardless of whether the role is in consumer, B2B, a startup, or a large company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. While basic skills like communication and analytical ability are important, these three attributes are what truly distinguish great product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Key Attributes

### 1. Simplifying and Breaking Things Down

The best product managers excel at simplifying complex situations and identifying the single most crucial task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. In large companies with numerous priorities and projects, it's easy for teams to get bogged down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. At startups, despite fewer overarching priorities, the sheer volume of "fires" and opportunities makes it difficult to focus on one thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Successful PMs can not only pinpoint the essential task but also [[key_strategies_and_practices_for_effective_product_management_and_team_building | stick with it]] long enough to complete it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Prioritization, a core aspect of simplifying, involves more than just a momentary decision; it's the resilience to ensure a chosen priority remains the most important thing until completion, keeping the team engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

**How to Build This Muscle:**
*   **Read Work Aloud:** When writing, read it out loud to identify unnecessary complexity. Often, the concise explanation given in conversation is what should be written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Cut Excess:** Generally, the first two paragraphs of any document can be deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Aim to remove anything that isn't necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Apply the Rule of Three:** Limit strategies, conclusions, or next steps to three main points maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **Seek Feedback:** Find peers or mentors who can review your work and help you simplify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Listen to experienced individuals who "had an insight on the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Focus Ruthlessly:** Avoid lumping too many ideas together, as it dilutes focus. Instead, pick the one thing with the most impact and cut less important items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Be Willing to Make the Bet:** Successful PMs must be willing to make decisions and take [[product_management_competencies | responsibility]] for them, acknowledging the inherent risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### 2. Following Up on Results

Many product managers set metrics or create dashboards but fail to follow up on the actual results of their shipped features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Top PMs consistently remember to check and share what happened with their initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This is a rare but high-value activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

**How to Practice This:**
*   **Set Calendar Reminders:** Use calendar reminders to check metrics two weeks, a month, or six months after a product launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
*   **Proactively Share Progress:** Share your progress with stakeholders. Don't rely on others to notice your [[product_management_competencies | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. This creates an "aura" of reliability and ensures managers know you've got things covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
*   **Learn from Outcomes:** Following up allows you to understand why something succeeded or failed, leading to continuous learning and improvement with every product shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. The more you ship, the more you learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

### 3. Carrying the Water (Doing Whatever It Takes)

This attribute emphasizes a willingness to do the "hard, boring, unglamorous work" that falls outside traditional [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager responsibilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. If you find yourself saying, "that's not my job," it's likely something you *should* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

**Characteristics of a "Water Carrier":**
*   **Ownership of Outcomes:** As a PM, you are responsible for the product's outcomes and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Filling the Gaps:** Unlike engineers (who write code) or designers (who create experiences), PMs don't have a singular deliverable. Their job is to ensure a business result is delivered, which means filling in all necessary gaps because no one else is incentivized to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.
*   **Emotional Center of the Team:** A PM is often the emotional center of the team, responsible for maintaining motivation, excitement, and buy-in for the project. This requires consistent optimism and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **No Task is Below You:** This includes tasks like customer support, sales, marketing, writing copy, [[key_skills_for_product_managers | project management]], QA, implementing with customers, or even selling the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Focus on Impact:** This willingness to do the work is what makes a product, and subsequently the PM, successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. It's about getting things out the door and creating [[product_management_competencies | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[Challenges and realities of working as a product manager | The Un-glamorous Reality]]: The [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | PM role]] is not always glamorous. Much of the job involves mundane or annoying tasks like project management or QA. While it offers ownership and the ability to decide what gets built, it also carries the responsibility to get things right and deliver results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

## Developing as a Product Manager

### Time to Expertise
It takes a significant amount of time to become truly confident and good at product management. Many find it takes around four to five years to "know what the hell they are doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. This is because building expertise requires shipping a lot of products over time, allowing one to learn from the consequences of their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. Staying at a company long enough to see multiple cycles of the same product can be more valuable than frequent job hopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

### Breaking into Product Management
Breaking into the product management field can be challenging due to limited entry-level programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. The most common paths include:
*   **Lateral Movement:** Switching to a PM role within an existing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
*   **Joining Startups:** Startups may be more willing to hire individuals without prior PM experience, though it requires significant work and mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
*   **Networking and Persistence:** Building a network and persistently engaging with people in the field can open doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

> [!TIP] The "PM Title" Advantage: Once you have a product manager title on your resume, future opportunities become significantly easier to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. Hiring managers often screen for this initial experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. The second question typically asked is "what have you shipped?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

### Product Strategy
A key part of the [[product_management_competencies | PM role]] is defining product strategy. A comprehensive strategy document, though potentially long, serves as internal homework for the PM to be confident in their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. It provides a logical chain from the company's mission down to individual priorities, allowing for clear alignment and constructive disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

> [!INFO] Product Strategy Outline:
> *   **Mission:** Company and team mission.
> *   **Landscape:** Current business and product status, market point of view, competitors, SWOT analysis, and key risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.
> *   **Current Goals:** Company's current business objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
> *   **Current State:** Honest assessment of product, business, and specific area, including what works/doesn't work, customer feedback (bottom-up), support tickets, and technical hurdles/debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.
> *   **Opportunity:** Based on the above, identify the top one or two opportunities, considering where the team can win and its unique competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.
> *   **Challenges:** What makes taking advantage of this opportunity difficult? What needs to be true for it to work? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
> *   **Solution:** Propose what to build and how it might work (aim for three key bullets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.
> *   **Plan:** Detail how you would sequence the work, resource the team, and implement the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.

### One-Pager (Spec/PRD)
The one-pager or PRD (Product Requirements Document) is the PM's artifact to define a product initiative for the immediate team (product, design, engineering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>. Its most crucial section is the background and context, which explains:
*   **The Problem:** What is it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>
*   **Why It Matters:** Why is this problem worth solving? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>
*   **Why It Matters Now:** This critical element, often overlooked, addresses the urgency and potential perishability of the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.

This document centers the team around the problem and its importance, serving as a "home base" for decisions made along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. Successful PMs are not precious about their work and actively seek feedback from engineering counterparts and others to poke holes and improve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>.

The pursuit of excellence in [[product_management_insights | product management]] is a continuous journey. Ian McAllister, author of the widely recognized post "What Separates a Top 1 Percent PM From a Top 10 PM," shares insights gleaned from managing over 100 [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | product managers]] and his extensive career at Amazon, Airbnb, and Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. His goal is to help individuals improve the craft of building and growing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Key Attributes of a Top 1 Percent PM

Ian McAllister identifies several core attributes that distinguish a [[key_traits_of_successful_product_managers | top one percent PM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>:

*   **Think Big**: Always hunt for bigger impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Communicate**: Essential for testing one's thinking and communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Simplify**: Achieve more with less by simplifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Prioritize**: Considered the core skill after communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Forecasting and Measuring**: Important for building instincts by forecasting, executing, measuring, and validating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Execute**: The core act of shipping and delivering on commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Understanding Technical Trade-offs**: While not requiring a software engineering background, knowing technical trade-offs helps in simplifying and optimizing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Understanding Good Design**: Crucial for customer-focused products, helping to think from the customer's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Writing Effective Copy**: Enhances communication with customers concisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

More recently, McAllister refreshed his list, adding several new attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>:

*   **Earn Trust with Others**: Seen as the currency of a [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | product manager]] and product leader, especially important for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Digging for Data**: Developing the tools to find data independently, rather than relying solely on analysts or reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Pushing Back Effectively**: An art and skill correlated with ability to grow and succeed as a leader; saying "yes" to everything leads nowhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Adapting to Change**: How one reacts to change impacts morale and effectiveness in rallying the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Driven by Impact, Not Promotion**: Waking up daily focused on having the biggest impact for the business is a reliable indicator of promotion potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

It's important to note that no single [[key_traits_of_successful_product_managers | top one percent PM]] excels at all these things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Focus for New Product Managers

For new [[breaking_into_product_management | product managers]], McAllister suggests focusing on three core attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>:

1.  **Communicate**:
    *   It's a skill that requires continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
    *   A common pitfall is rambling or providing too much background without directly answering the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
    *   **Tactical Tip**: "Answer first, then explain, or sometimes answer and then shut up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
    *   **Tactical Tip**: Grade yourself after communications (meetings, emails) and reflect on how to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
    *   Use numbers to answer questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
    *   The stakes for effective communication get higher as one works with more senior people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

2.  **Prioritize**:
    *   This is the number one key tool for a [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | product manager]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
    *   Prioritization encompasses themes, projects, sequencing, scope, and time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
    *   A [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | product manager]] with strong innate prioritization skills can generate 5x the impact of someone without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
    *   Working backwards is a good technique to guide prioritization and have impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

3.  **Execute**:
    *   Execution involves molding what needs to be built into a simple, compact package with the highest possible impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
    *   It's a function of the entire team, including designers, data scientists, and engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
    *   [[Product managers]] act as the "motive power" behind execution and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

New [[product managers]] should focus less on "thinking big," "understanding technical trade-offs," and "understanding good design," as these become more critical later in one's [[product_management_career_advice | product management career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

## Focus for Senior Product Managers

For senior [[product managers]], the focus shifts to broader influence and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>:

1.  **Communicate**: Still crucial at every level, with higher stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

2.  **Think Big**:
    *   This involves expanding beyond the typical "box" of product management responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.
    *   It means taking a wider view of what success for your product entails, even if it goes beyond traditional product or tech functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
    *   A senior [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | product manager]] should identify and remove constraints or barriers to product success, regardless of their nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
    *   **Tactical Tip**: Think like an owner, considering the broader business beyond just one's immediate product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

3.  **Earn Trust**:
    *   This is the "currency" of a product leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
    *   Trust is built by consistently setting and meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.
    *   Practices that build trust include: telling the truth, launching when promised, owning mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
    *   Practices that lose trust include: lying, being evasive, not shipping what was promised, ignoring or repeating mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
    *   For McAllister, this was a skill whose importance he was slow to recognize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
    *   **Tactical Tip**: Spend time to understand other people's and organizations' goals to achieve alignment and forge alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

4.  **Driven by Impact**:
    *   Focusing on having the biggest impact, rather than politics or promotions, should guide every part of a senior [[product_management_competencies_and_career_development | product manager's]] day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
    *   For junior [[product managers]], impact might be about shipping a feature, but for senior roles, it's about influencing broader prioritization and roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
    *   Senior [[product managers]] are evaluated primarily on their impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
    *   Working on "offense" — projects that directly drive revenue or customer growth — can often correlate with greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

## The "Working Backwards" Process and its Misconceptions

McAllister's long tenure at Amazon profoundly shaped his "product toolbox" and "leadership toolbox" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Amazon's culture, while sometimes described as a "crucible," resonated with his structured thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. The core idea was to identify a single metric or "fitness function" for success and relentlessly work to improve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.

### Learnings from Amazon Leadership

*   **Jeff Bezos**: McAllister found Bezos to be encouraging and a teacher of the "working backwards" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.
    *   A key lesson: if a press release for a product doesn't have a problem paragraph, "there's not really a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. This highlights the importance of truly starting with the customer problem, not a pre-conceived solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.
    *   Bezos's criteria for investing in something new: Is it a big idea? Is it something we should be doing? Is there a legitimate plan to succeed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>

*   **Jeff Wilkie**: Known as the "consummate operator," Wilkie instilled a continuous improvement mindset and rigor across Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
    *   Weekly Business Reviews (WBRs) were a key mechanism: leaders would present on their metrics, and Wilkie would probe and ask questions, forcing deep business knowledge and preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
    *   Wilkie exemplified "tough love" — professional, respectful, but direct when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>.
    *   He was excellent at teaching the "why" behind decisions and mental models, fostering deeper understanding and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

### Common Mistakes in Implementing "Working Backwards"

The most common mistake teams make when attempting to adopt "working backwards" is **starting with a solution they want to build, rather than genuinely obsessing about the problem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. They might retrofit a problem or customer justification after already having a solution in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

Signs a team is making this mistake include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>:
*   Talking about "pieces in the pantry" or "ingredients" that can be combined (e.g., "we have these two technologies, we could combine them") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.
*   Focusing on technologies or assets that "look similar" and could be integrated for "all goodness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.

### The Essence of Working Backwards

The core of "working backwards" is about starting with **the problem** and obsessing over it, allowing it to guide the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. The "press release" and "FAQ" documents used at Amazon are merely a *mechanism* to enforce this problem-first approach, not the essence of working backwards itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.

*   **Process, not just a format**: While the press release and FAQ are useful templates, the key is to cultivate the muscle of truly working backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.
*   **Problem-focused**: A genuine "working backwards" approach begins with a compelling customer problem, even before the solution is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>.
*   **"Fact" document**: This part of the process evaluates the "legitimate plan to succeed," assessing internal components, finances, or key technical hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. It's a way to build trust that the idea is well-thought-out enough to merit resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.
*   **Scale**: It is generally advisable for significant new products, but might have too much overhead for every minor feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to be true to the spirit of working backwards from what you are trying to do for customers and what problem you are solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.

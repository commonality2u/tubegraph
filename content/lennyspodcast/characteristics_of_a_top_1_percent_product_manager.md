Ian McAllister, author of the widely-read post "What separates a top one percent PM from a top 10 pm," shares his insights on the essential [[attributes_of_successful_product_managers | attributes]] that distinguish top product managers, for both new and senior professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He emphasizes that focusing on these [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]] and behaviors is crucial for achieving significant [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | career growth]] and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Core Attributes of Top Product Managers

McAllister initially outlined several [[traits_of_successful_product_managers | traits]], later adding more based on further reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>:

*   **Think Big**: Always pursue the greatest possible impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Communicate**: Essential for conveying thought clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Simplify**: Achieve more with fewer resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Prioritize**: The core skill of a PM, viewed through many lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Forecasting and Measuring**: Crucial for building instincts and validating efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Execute**: Consistently deliver and ship products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Understand Technical Trade-offs**: Helps in simplifying and optimizing resource yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Understand Good Design**: Essential for customer-focused products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Write Effective Copy**: Communicate concisely with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Earn Trust with Others**: The "currency" of a product manager and leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Dig for Data**: Develop tools to find data independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Push Back Effectively**: Correlated with the ability to grow as a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Adapt to Change**: Impacts morale and team effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Driven by Impact, Not Promotion**: The ultimate guiding principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

It's important to note that no single PM excels at all these [[product_management_competencies | competencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### For New Product Managers

For those new to product management, the top three [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]] to focus on are:

1.  **Communicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
    *   Continuously work on being a better communicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
    *   Learn to answer questions directly first, then explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
    *   Grade yourself after communicating, or ask for feedback from your manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
2.  **Prioritize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
    *   Consider which themes to prioritize in a roadmap, which projects within a theme, and how to sequence them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
    *   Time management is also a prioritization function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
    *   A great ability to prioritize can lead to 5x the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
3.  **Execute** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>
    *   Execution involves molding desired outcomes into a simple, high-impact package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
    *   It's a function of the team (designers, data scientists, engineers), and PMs have ownership in helping the team improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
    *   PMs are the "motive power" behind execution and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

New PMs should focus less on "think big," "understand technical trade-offs," or "understand good design," as these become more critical later in one's [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

### For Senior Product Managers

For senior product managers looking to level up their [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career]], the key areas are:

1.  **Communicate**: The stakes are higher at senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.
2.  **Think Big**: Look for "bigger elephants" by expanding the scope of ideas and considering how a product could have a broader impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. This means taking a wider view of what success looks like, potentially owning areas beyond typical product scope until someone else can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
3.  **Earn Trust**: This is the "currency" for product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Trust is built by consistently setting and meeting expectations, telling the truth, owning mistakes, and launching what was promised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>. Losing trust happens by lying, being evasive, failing to ship, or repeating mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
4.  **Driven by Impact, Not Promotion**: Wake up every day aiming to have the biggest impact possible for the business. This focus will naturally lead to promotion and [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.

> "If you simply wake up every day trying to have the biggest impact you can... that's a really good guiding light." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>

Senior PMs should proactively seek opportunities to drive bigger impacts and influence roadmaps, moving beyond just shipping assigned features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. Working on "offense" — projects that directly drive dollars or customers — tends to gain more executive attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

## The Amazon "Working Backwards" Process

Ian McAllister spent 12 years at Amazon, building products like Amazon Smile and leading Alexa's international growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. His experience there deeply influenced his understanding of product management, particularly the "working backwards" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

The core of working backwards is starting with the **problem** and obsessing over it before moving to the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

### Common Mistakes in Implementing Working Backwards

Teams often make the mistake of having a solution in mind first and then retrofitting a problem or customer need to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. For example, starting with "we could combine these two technologies" instead of "what is the customer's problem?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.

> "If you don't have a problem paragraph, there's not really a problem." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>

This problem-first approach ensures that the solution genuinely addresses a customer pain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>. If discussions immediately jump to combining existing technologies or assets, it's a sign that the team might not be truly working backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

### The Mechanism: Press Release and FAQ (FAQ)

The "working backwards" mechanism at Amazon involves writing an internal press release and a comprehensive FAQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. The press release structure typically includes:

*   Problem paragraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>
*   Solution paragraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>
*   Customer quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>

The FAQ section ensures there is a **legitimate plan to succeed**, addressing components like finances, technical hurdles, and operational considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. This serves as an early-stage test of whether the idea has a viable plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>.

This process is generally applied to significant new products, but the core principle of starting with the problem can be adapted to any format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.

### Lessons from Jeff Bezos on Investment Criteria

Jeff Bezos's criteria for investing in something new are three-fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>:

1.  **Is it a big idea?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>
2.  **Is it something we should be doing?** (Is it aligned with the company's mission/capabilities?) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>
3.  **Is there a legitimate plan to succeed?** (Addressed by the FAQ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>

## Learning from Amazon Leadership

McAllister gained significant [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | insights]] from leaders like Jeff Bezos and Jeff Wilkie, especially regarding the [[challenges_and_realities_of_working_as_a_product_manager | operational mindset]] and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

### Jeff Bezos

Bezos was encouraging and used meetings to teach the working backwards process. For example, he pointed out that a missing problem paragraph indicated a solution-first approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. He emphasized that the innovation process doesn't have to be efficient initially because the prerequisite for efficiency is knowing where you're going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

### Jeff Wilkie

Wilkie, Amazon's SVP for worldwide Discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, embodied the "consummate operator" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. He instilled:

*   **Operational Rigor**: Not just building new things, but effectively running what's already built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.
*   **Weekly Business Reviews (WBRs)**: A mechanism that trained leaders to be prepared, know their business metrics, and understand variances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This created a cascading effect of accountability and insight throughout the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.
*   **"Tough Love"**: Providing direct, professional feedback that builds respect and drives improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>.
*   **Teaching the "Why"**: Explaining the mental model behind decisions, rather than just giving prescriptive advice, which helps others learn and commit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.

The ability to continuously improve is a crucial muscle to build for any product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. This mindset, combined with understanding the nuances of communication, prioritization, and execution, forms the bedrock for any product manager striving for excellence.

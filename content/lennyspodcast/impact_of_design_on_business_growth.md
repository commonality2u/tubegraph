Design, often associated with aesthetics or "beauty," is frequently misunderstood as a separate or lesser priority than "functionality" in business. However, functionality and beauty are not opposing forces; rather, [[the_importance_of_design_in_modern_products | beauty enhances functionality]] by making products easier to use, more approachable, and more compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. A decline in the use of the word "beauty" in digitized books aligns with a focus on functionality alone, suggesting a societal shift away from valuing aesthetic quality in products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## How Design Directly Drives Growth

Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe, emphasizes that design can directly lead to business growth, revenue, and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

Key impacts of high-quality design:

*   **Increased Trust** Beautiful designs signal meticulous attention to detail, assuring users that the creators care about visible and invisible aspects of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This is a key priority even for B2B financial infrastructure companies like Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:09">[02:04:09]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Usability & Accessibility** Well-designed products are inherently easier to use, leading to better user outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:37">[02:04:37]</a>.
*   **Improved User Experience & Feelings** The visual and structural design of a product impacts how people feel when using it, influencing their overall satisfaction and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:27">[02:03:27]</a>. This emotional connection fosters repeat usage and positive word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>.
*   **"Beauty Begets Beauty"** High-quality design inspires similar quality in other parts of the business and product ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.
*   **Attracting Top Talent** Organizations that prioritize quality and meticulous craft foster a sense of pride, making them more attractive to skilled professionals who want their work valued and recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:47">[02:05:47]</a>.

## The ROI of Quality

While the [[experimentation_and_decisionmaking_in_business_growth | ROI of design]] might seem unclear, making features "great" rather than simply adding more can lead to significant business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

> "Quality is growth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>

Stripe's growth team is "maniacally focused" on building better experiences because they've seen a direct link to business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>.

### Case Studies in Design-Driven Growth:

*   **Onboarding Flow Improvements** Enhancing the Stripe onboarding flow to make products easier to understand led to a direct increase in activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>.
*   **Checkout Experience Optimization** Research revealed that 99% of top e-commerce sites had errors in their checkout flows that hindered conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. By continuously improving the quality of the checkout experience (even small details), Stripe observed a **10.5% increase in revenue** for businesses using their newer checkout solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>. This highlights how design decisions translate directly to bottom-line results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:44">[01:48:44]</a>.

## Operationalizing Quality and Design

Achieving high-quality design requires a concerted, ongoing effort, as there's a "gravitational pull to mediocrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:53">[02:46:53]</a>.

### Key Principles:

1.  **Quality is a Group Effort** It cannot be outsourced to a single person or team (e.g., QA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>. The internal clarity and standards of an organization will be reflected externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:53">[02:56:53]</a>.
2.  **Vision and Alignment** Even highly talented individuals will produce disparate results without a shared vision of the final product. Like building a house, a comprehensive plan and oversight (like an architect or general contractor) are crucial to ensure all parts fit together harmoniously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:50">[03:08:50]</a>.
3.  **Editing and Courage** Leaders must have the courage to say "no, this isn't good enough" even when significant effort has been invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:21">[03:21:21]</a>. This resolve is essential for building a high-quality product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
4.  **User-Centric Understanding** To build quality, one must understand the product from the user's perspective, especially across their entire journey (e.g., starting from a Google search, through the website, to documentation, and the dashboard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.

### "Walk the Store" Process at Stripe

To maintain and improve product quality over time, Stripe implemented a "Walk the Store" program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>:

*   **Objective:** Combat quality regression over time (where new features can make existing ones feel worse, or organizational silos lead to disconnected experiences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Process:**
    *   Identify 15 critical user journeys that are essential to get right at the highest quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:52">[03:50:52]</a>.
    *   Assign engineering, product, and design leaders to be responsible for the quality of these journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
    *   These leaders regularly "walk the store" â€“ experiencing the product as a user would, from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
    *   They "friction log" their experiences, noting what works and what doesn't, filing bugs, and reaching out to relevant teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:39">[03:56:39]</a>. This complements, but does not replace, [[strategies_for_effective_user_research_and_its_business_impact | user research]] and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
    *   Teams perform these walkthroughs together (engineer, product manager, designer) to gain diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
    *   They score the journey based on a rubric that considers usability, utility, desirability, and the "surprisingly great" factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. A color-based scoring system avoids getting bogged down in subjective numerical debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
    *   Quarterly "Product Quality Review" (PQR) calibration meetings are held with senior leaders (like Katie Dill and David Singleton) to discuss scores, debate interpretations, and ensure consistent quality standards across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** This process increases awareness and accountability for product quality, cascading the importance of user journeys throughout the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. It leads to upstream impact by revealing larger opportunities for improvement and informing process changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. It also converts skeptics from other functions into advocates for quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

## Leadership and Team Building for Design Impact

Effective design leadership focuses on fostering an environment where quality can thrive.

### Performance Formula:

> Performance = Potential - Interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>

As a leader, the goal is to increase team potential (through good hiring and talent development) and decrease interferences (organizational hurdles, lack of clarity, misaligned processes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.

### Reducing Interference:

*   **Organizational Alignment** The way a company is organized internally reflects externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:53">[02:56:53]</a>. Ensuring that teams are structured to collaborate effectively can significantly reduce wasted work and misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Physical Co-location (where applicable)** At Lyft and Airbnb, design teams initially sat separately. Re[[the_impact_of_organizational_structure_on_growth | organizing teams]] to sit side-by-side with engineers and product managers, while maintaining dedicated creative spaces, led to faster iteration cycles and better clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Shared Awareness** Combatting the loss of touch between departments in a growing company is vital. Katie implements a system where designers share screenshots or prototypes of their work in a shared Google Slide deck every few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. This "Picture Tells a Thousand Words" approach provides:
    *   Clarity across the design team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.
    *   Visibility for product managers, engineering leaders, and company leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>.
    *   Identification of redundant work or potential collisions early in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.
    *   This low-maintenance method ensures accessibility for all functions, not just designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.

### Fostering Bold Ideas:

*   **Fight the Fear of Bold Ideas** Companies often opt for incremental changes because they are safer and easier to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. This can lead to a fragmented user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.
*   **"Reach for the Stars and Land on the Moon"** Vision work is crucial. It involves sketching out the ideal, comprehensive experience (an "11-star experience") across the entire user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This North Star guides incremental steps, ensuring they contribute to a cohesive, high-quality future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### Hiring Designers for Impact:

When hiring for design roles, especially for non-designers, consider:

*   **Taste and Character over Tools and Process** It's easier to teach specific software or methodologies than to cultivate inherent good taste and strong character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>.
*   **Humility** Humble designers are more likely to listen to users, be curious about what's working (or not), and adapt their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.
*   **Hustle/Hutzpah (Courage)** Design involves proposing new ideas, which can be scary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. Look for individuals who have the courage to advocate for excellence and execute rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>.
*   **Doers vs. Thinkers** In early-stage companies, a "doer" is essential, but it's also important to have a strategic mindset that can build a user-focused [[strategic_thinking_and_category_design_in_business | organization]] from the start. A senior design advisor coupled with a full-time "executor" can be a good model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>.

Ultimately, design is about intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. By thinking intentionally about who is impacted by every decision, and bringing care and meticulous craft to the work, better outcomes can be achieved both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

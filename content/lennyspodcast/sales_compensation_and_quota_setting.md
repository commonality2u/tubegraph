Sales compensation and quota setting are crucial, yet often misunderstood, aspects of building a successful sales team in B2B and SaaS companies. Many founders and executives make consistent mistakes in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, viewing it as a "black box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

## Early-Stage Compensation Philosophy

In the very beginning, the focus should be on whether a sales representative can close more deals than they cost the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>. For the first three months, it's considered good if a new rep can close enough to cover their on-target earnings (OTE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:01">[01:55:01]</a>.

A recommended early-stage compensation plan for the first three months allows the rep to keep 100% of what they close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:56:09]</a>. While not immediately profitable for the business, this incentivizes the rep and helps them "put supper on the stove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:21">[01:56:21]</a>.

### Market Rate and Breakdown
Founders must pay market rate for sales talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:34">[01:57:34]</a>. For example, a rep might ask for $150,000 OTE, which could be a step down from previous roles at larger companies like Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:47">[01:57:47]</a>. This OTE is typically split 50/50 between base salary and bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. Thus, a $140,000 OTE means a $70,000 base salary, with the goal of earning another $70,000 in bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:20">[01:58:20]</a>. This means the initial cash commitment is only a few thousand dollars per month to see if the experiment works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:22">[01:57:22]</a>.

### Revenue Multiplier
Ultimately, a sales rep should bring in four to five times what they take home in total compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:50">[01:57:50]</a>. This multiplier is typically:
*   **3x** for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:06">[01:58:06]</a>
*   **4x** for mid-market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:08">[01:58:08]</a>
*   **5x or more** for Enterprise deals, where compensation is also higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>

If a rep makes $150,000 and closes $450,000, they are accretive to the business, assuming marketing costs are reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:29">[01:58:29]</a>. The goal is for reps to be rich, earning a lot of money, because this means the company is also making a lot of money and increasing its equity value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:25">[01:59:25]</a>.

## Quota Adjustments and Review

While initial compensation plans can be generous, they should transition. The 100% commission for the first few months should ideally last for one quarter maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:47">[01:54:47]</a>. Extending it too long can lead to mediocre performers leaning on it, which is detrimental to the company and the rep themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>.

Quotas are often revisited, but ideally, a well-architected sales compensation plan should not need frequent adjustments for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:31">[01:50:31]</a>. Minor tweaks can be made, but significant changes can "burn up all the cash" if the underlying sales model is flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Paying less than market rate:** Negotiating someone down from $150,000 OTE to $130,000 makes little difference if the goal is for them to close $600,000 or $700,000 in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:06">[01:59:06]</a>.
*   **Over-hiring:** It is generally better to have fewer, more effective reps than many struggling ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:13">[01:51:13]</a>. For example, two reps closing $2 million each are preferable to 20 reps struggling to close $100,000 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:39">[01:51:39]</a>. This often leads to cultural issues, lack of domain knowledge, and overall misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:46">[01:51:46]</a>.
*   **Focusing on win rates over lost deals:** Companies tend to celebrate wins and discuss their successes, but learning from lost deals is equally, if not more, important for sales strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>.

## Product Team Involvement in Revenue Metrics

The trend of product teams taking on P&L responsibilities and revenue goals is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>. While alignment on overall revenue goals is important, directly tying individual PM KPIs and OKRs to revenue goals for experimental features can be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.

*   **Risk of Weaponization:** Forcing teams, like customer success, to prioritize revenue from existing customers (e.g., through aggressive upsells or threats to cut service) can destroy customer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. This "weaponizes" the team and leads to customer-hostile practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>, ultimately harming revenue compounding in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>.
*   **Balancing Experimentation and Risk:** Every product extension is expensive and risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>. If product teams are punished for initiatives that don't immediately hit revenue targets, it discourages innovation and risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:58">[01:23:58]</a>. Larger companies often tolerate failure in new initiatives better than startups due to the high cost of failure in early-stage companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Customer Centricity:** Product leaders should be the "voice of the customer," especially when considering metrics and incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:28">[01:32:28]</a>. The focus should be on building businesses with compounding revenue by delivering more value than they take out from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>. This also applies to pricing: earned price increases (due to significant value added) are sustainable, unlike unearned ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>.

## The Role of the "VP of Free"

Many companies have a massive free user base (e.g., from a freemium model or free trials) but often lack a dedicated "VP of Free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:18">[01:32:18]</a>. This role, often a collaboration between product and the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>, is crucial because growth teams are typically incentivized to monetize, not nurture, the free user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>. Product leaders should champion the free user base, as they are often advocates and contribute to the product's overall quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>. Products with a free edition tend to be better because they force investment in strong onboarding, unlike products that rely on human intervention to bridge the gap between buying and deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:49">[01:37:49]</a>.

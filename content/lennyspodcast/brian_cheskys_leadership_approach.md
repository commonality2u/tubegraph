Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, is recognized as an inspiring leader in the tech and business world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. His approach to leadership and company management has undergone significant evolution, especially during the pandemic, leading to a unique operational model at Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:57">[01:37:57]</a>. Chesky emphasizes clarity, unified direction, and deep personal involvement in the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## Evolution of Leadership at Airbnb

Chesky describes a common cycle for [[marc_benioffs_insights_on_leadership_and_entrepreneurship | Founders]] where they initially run the show, then delegate and empower, which can lead to optimization work, small thinking, bureaucracy, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>. Eventually, they realize the need to "take the oars again" and drive the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. This was his own journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

Prior to 2019, Airbnb experienced increasing costs, slower growth, politics, bureaucracy, and a sense that the product wasn't evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:07">[02:37:07]</a>. The company had become highly divisional, with separate teams for flights, homes, business travel, and more, all going in different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:06">[02:36:06]</a>. This decentralized approach led to increased dependencies and a focus on individual division advocacy rather than overall company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:07">[02:37:07]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which caused Airbnb to lose 80% of its business in eight weeks, served as a "near-death business experience" that brought immense clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. Chesky decided to fundamentally change how Airbnb operated, moving back to a more startup-like model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:06">[02:47:06]</a>.

### Key Principles of Chesky's [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | Leadership]]

#### Deep Involvement and "Being in the Details"
Chesky believes that [[selective_micromanagement_as_a_leadership_approach | micromanagement]], which is telling people exactly what to do, is different from being "in the details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. Being in the details is essential for leaders to ensure quality and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. He got involved in every single detail of the product, reviewing work weekly or bi-weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:02">[02:59:02]</a>. This direct involvement allows him to identify bottlenecks and ensure teams collaborate effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:02">[02:59:02]</a>.

He notes that initially, this deep involvement meant working more intensely, but ultimately, it led to less conflict, less turnover, and a more unified direction, surprisingly freeing up his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:04">[05:10:04]</a>.

#### CEO as Chief Product Officer
Chesky asserts that for a product- or tech-led company, the CEO should effectively be the Chief Product Officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Delegating this core function can lead to founders delegating away their greatest strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. He emphasizes that if the CEO isn't the chief product officer, it might indicate the company isn't truly product or tech-led <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

#### Functional Organization and Unified Vision
Airbnb shifted from a divisional model to a purely functional model, with leaders specializing in design, engineering, product marketing, communications, sales, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This means:
*   **Fewer employees, more senior people**: The company actively cut down on the number of projects and layers of management, prioritizing fewer, more senior employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Expert leaders**: Every executive is expected to be an expert in their functional domain, managing the work first and the people second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Centralized decision-making**: Decision-making was pulled in, creating "one shared consciousness" among the top 30-40 people in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Single, rolling roadmap**: Airbnb operates on a single, rolling two-year product roadmap, updated every six months, with products released twice a year (May and November) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This ensures the entire company rows in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

#### Product-Led Growth and Integrated Storytelling
Airbnb has shifted away from traditional growth channels like paid growth, betting that building the "best possible product" and effectively communicating about it will drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Key aspects include:
*   **Combined product management and marketing**: The traditional product management function was combined with product marketing, meaning those responsible for product development also handle outbound marketing responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **"Product marketers"**: These senior individuals are responsible for both the inbound development and outbound communication, understanding that you can't build a product effectively unless you know how to talk about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **Story dictates product**: When working on a launch, determining the product's story is one of the first steps, as the story often dictates the product itself, helping to develop a cohesive product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **In-house creative**: Airbnb built its own in-house creative agency to ensure consistency in brand touchpoints and product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

#### Ambitious Goal Setting and Bias for Action
Chesky is known for pushing teams to "10x" their ideas or "add a zero" to their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This isn't just about hitting a bigger number, but about forcing teams to think differently and break problems down to their "first principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

He emphasizes setting the pace for the team, which is governed by decisiveness and a bias for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Meetings are structured to make immediate decisions rather than delaying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### Personal Growth and Well-being
Chesky acknowledges he hasn't historically been a "poster child" for work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. However, he has learned to intentionally step away from work to gain perspective, incorporating practices like:
*   **Alternating intense work weekends with full weekends off** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
*   **Daily exercise and healthy eating habits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing healthy relationships**: He maintains close contact with friends and family, recognizing that strong relationships are a key to happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

He also stresses the importance of continuous learning and maintaining a "beginner's mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This involves being curious, studying history, and being "shameless" about asking for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### An Artist's Influence
A notable "fun fact" about Chesky is that he spent most of his life as an artist and industrial designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. This background in design, which required understanding engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and sales, greatly influenced his approach to building and running Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. He believes that intuition, imagination, design, and curiosity are crucial qualities needed in business leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.

### Paying it Forward
Chesky actively helps other founders, viewing it as paying forward the generosity he received when starting Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. He emphasizes the "incredible culture of generosity" in Silicon Valley, where people help one another, fostering a healthy ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. He believes he also learns by teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

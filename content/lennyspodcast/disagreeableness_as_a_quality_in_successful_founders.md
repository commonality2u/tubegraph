Successful startups and founders exhibit three core actions, one of which is [[contrarian_approaches_in_business_strategy | disagreeableness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>. Fundamentally, all startups are disagreeable, as they represent a disagreement with existing patterns and methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>.

## Escaping the Conformity Trap

To succeed, founders must break free from the conformity trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a>. Pressure to conform often prevents exploration beyond established limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:33">[01:24:33]</a>. Great founders are akin to "Jonathan Livingston Seagull," willing to pursue an obsession and sacrifice status to fulfill their mission, understanding that one cannot stand out by always fitting in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>.

## The Right Kind of Disagreeableness

The concept of a founder being "coachable" is often misunderstood; truly successful founders are disagreeable in a specific way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. For instance, Ev Williams, founder of Twitter, often disregarded advice on fundraising, yet his decisions proved successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. The investor did not mind that Williams didn't always listen, because he was the "right kind of disagreeable" â€“ he listened and understood, but ultimately believed in a different truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:48">[01:26:48]</a>.

Historical figures like Bill Gates, often perceived as warm and fuzzy today, were known for being tough and hard-nosed, but their high standards inspired greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>. This aligns with [[the_role_of_dissatisfaction_and_innovation_in_leadership | principles of power acquisition]], where not everyone will like you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:16">[01:29:16]</a>. Leaders must be willing to wield both the "carrot and the stick" to create sufficient activation energy for people to embrace a different future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>.

## Facing Criticism

Founders will face pressure from those who leverage their desire to fit in, telling them they "can't do that" because it's "illegal," "unethical," or portrays them as a "tech bro bad guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>. Paradoxically, before achieving success, founders need the courage to be disliked because people may dismiss their ideas as stupid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:12">[01:30:12]</a>. After success, the criticism may intensify, with accusations of cheating, breaking rules, or being too powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>. However, this comes with the territory of changing the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:36">[01:30:36]</a>.

## Internal Chaos in Startups

Internally, successful startups often operate in a state of chaos and ambiguity, with constant debate over direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>. While this may seem messy, "movements are messy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>. A startup never triumphs over a large company by simply executing better; instead, it wins by proposing a radically different future that disorients the incumbent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>. This messy, often chaotic, internal environment is characteristic of such ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:46">[01:31:46]</a>.

Founders must possess the [[resilience_and_perseverance_in_startups | willingness to fail]] to achieve breakthrough success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>. Departing from consensus always carries the risk of being wrong, but it is this willingness that enables disproportionate outperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. There are no shortcuts; a strategy designed "can't lose" also "can't win big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:16">[01:39:16]</a>.

## The Lonely Road of Founding

Founding a company is a lonely existence, and it is acceptable if most people do not like an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:46">[01:39:46]</a>. Dislike does not mean an idea is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:56">[01:39:56]</a>. Few people are willing to take risks for beliefs they see before others, and facing doubt is part of the journey for every great founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

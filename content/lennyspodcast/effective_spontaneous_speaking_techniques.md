Matt Abrahams, a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and host of the "Think Fast, Talk Smart" podcast, specializes in [[improving_communication_skills | communication skills]] and [[tips_for_improving_public_speaking_and_overcoming_fear | public speaking]]. His expertise focuses on two key areas: reducing [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | anxiety]] before and during [[tips_for_improving_public_speaking_and_overcoming_fear | public speaking]], and enhancing on-the-spot speaking abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. Speaking well is a [[impact_of_speaking_as_a_meta_skill | superpower]] in one's career, aiding in interviewing, excelling in meetings, pitching ideas, and leading teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

## Overcoming Public Speaking Anxiety

Many people experience [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | nervousness]] when speaking publicly, and this is a normal human condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>. It's crucial to remember that you are not alone in feeling this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. Even experienced speakers often feel [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | nervous]] before important talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:07">[01:55:07]</a>.

### Visualization Techniques
Instead of imagining the audience naked, which is often unhelpful and inappropriate, Abrahams recommends using [[visualization_techniques_for_speaking_anxiety | visualization]] as a tool for desensitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:41">[06:50:41]</a>. This involves:
*   **Seeing the Event**: Visualize yourself in the speaking space, even if you only have a picture of the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
*   **The Full Experience**: Picture yourself getting on stage, delivering the presentation, seeing it well-received, and stepping off the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   **Audience Response**: Visualize the audience responding positively to you and your message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   **Dress Rehearsal**: This process acts as a mental dress rehearsal, making the actual event feel less new and novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.
*   **Combining with Calm**: Combine visualization with deep [[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | breathing technique]]s to further calm your [[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | body]] and prevent associating the visualization with stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

### Dare to be Dull
This technique, inspired by improvisation, encourages speakers to prioritize connection over perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.
*   **Reduce Self-Evaluation**: Instead of striving for the "best" answer or the "most interesting" small talk, just aim to get the task done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.
*   **Free Up Resources**: By dialing down self-evaluation, you free up cognitive resources that can be used for genuine engagement and connection with your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.
*   **Improved Performance**: Often, by giving yourself permission to be "dull," you end up performing better because the pressure is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

### Cognitive Reframing
Reframing [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | anxiety]] symptoms as excitement can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. The [[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | human body]] has one main arousal response; the difference lies in how we label it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>.
*   **Label as Positive**: When you feel symptoms like a faster heart rate or shakiness, tell yourself, "This is exciting! I get to share my point of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.
*   **Relaxation**: This positive labeling leads to relaxation and can result in improved communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.

### Mantras
Using a simple mantra can help change negative self-talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>.
*   **Positive Affirmation**: Instead of dwelling on negative thoughts, repeat a positive phrase like "I have value to bring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Other effective mantras include "You've got this," "I'm prepared," "I know my stuff," or "It's not about me, it's about my content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>.
*   **Reminders**: Write it on a Post-It note or set a phone reminder to flash a minute or two before you speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>.

### Normalizing Anxiety
Recognizing that [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | anxiety]] is a common experience can reduce personal pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.
*   **Shared Experience**: Many people feel [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | nervous]], including executives and experienced speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">[21:29:00]</a>.
*   **Process, Not Binary**: Getting better is a process; it's not about having or not having [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | anxiety]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>.

### Conversational Speaking
Approach presentations or meetings as [[the_importance_of_conversational_speaking | conversational]] rather than formal presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:16:00">[22:16:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Conversation**: You can have a conversation with yourself, e.g., "Today I have three questions I'd like to answer. Question number one is..." then state and answer it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>. This internal dialogue can reduce [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | anxiety]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>.

### Distraction Techniques
Temporarily shifting the audience's focus can help you compose yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Start with a question to the audience, tell a story, show a video, or ask them to read something relevant to the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:00">[24:14:00]</a>. This briefly diverts attention, allowing you to calm down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>.
*   **Critical First Minute**: Most people are most [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | nervous]] one minute before speaking and the first minute of speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. Distraction can help you get through this initial hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>.

### Breathing Techniques
[[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | Breathing technique]]s are highly effective for [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | calming their anxiety]] symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:14:00">[26:14:00]</a>.
*   **Physiological Impact**: Slows heart rate, normalizes voice (as nervousness can make breathing shallow), and reduces shakiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>.
*   **Double Exhale**: Take a full inhale, then sneak in a little extra air, followed by an exhale that is twice as long as the inhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>. The magic of relaxation happens during the exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>.
*   **4-4-8 Breathing**: Breathe in for four seconds, hold for four seconds, and breathe out for eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:17]</a>.
*   **Mind-Body Connection**: What your [[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | body]] feels, your [[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | mind]] thinks, so changing your physiological state can calm your [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | nervous]]ness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>.

### Tongue Twisters
Saying [[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | tongue twisters]] can help you get present-oriented, as you cannot say them correctly without focusing on the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>. It also warms up your voice, which is often neglected by [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | nervous]] speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:15:00">[29:15:00]</a>.

### Swearing
Research suggests that [[public_speaking_and_humor_in_presentations | swearing]] can reduce [[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | anxiety]] by releasing neurochemicals that blunt those associated with stress (e.g., cortisol), providing a dopamine and serotonin hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:00">[30:58:00]</a>. (Note: Not recommended for public use).

## Improving Spontaneous Speaking Skills

Most [[tips_for_improving_public_speaking_and_overcoming_fear | public speaking]] is spontaneous, occurring in situations like Q&A, giving feedback, or toasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:59:00">[33:59:00]</a>.

### Core Principles
1.  **Ability to Improve**: Everyone can get better at spontaneous communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.
2.  **Preparation**: You must prepare to be spontaneous. Like athletes or jazz musicians, extensive [[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | practice]] and preparation enable fluid, on-the-spot performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:00">[35:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Mindset & Approach**: Address both your mindset towards spontaneous speaking and how you approach it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:49:00">[35:49:00]</a>.
4.  **Messaging through Structure**: Crafting messages through clear structure and focus is crucial for better delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>.

### Importance of Structure
Human brains are wired for story and logical connection, not lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:13:00">[37:13:00]</a>. Relying on a structure for spontaneous speaking eases the burden by providing the "how to say it," so you only need to focus on "what to say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:00">[37:57:57]</a>.

#### Key Structures:
*   **Problem-Solution-Benefit**: Common in advertising, it presents a problem, how it's solved, and the resulting benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:33:00">[37:33:00]</a>.
*   **PREP**:
    *   **P**oint: Make your main point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:40:00">[38:40:00]</a>.
    *   **R**eason: Give a reason for your point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a>.
    *   **E**xample: Provide an example to illustrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a>.
    *   **P**oint (Restate): Reiterate your main point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a>.
*   **What, So What, Now What**:
    *   **What**: Describe the topic, product, or update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:02:00">[39:02:00]</a>.
    *   **So What**: Explain why it's important or relevant to the audience/company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15:00">[39:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Now What**: State what comes next or what actions will be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:24:00">[39:24:00]</a>. This is particularly useful for product teams or status updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:26:00">[39:26:00]</a>.

#### Remembering Structures:
*   **Catchy Names**: Using mnemonics helps recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:29:00">[40:29:00]</a>.
*   **Practice**: The best way is to consistently use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:44:00">[40:44:00]</a>.
*   **Interrogation**: After listening to a podcast or reading, briefly apply a structure: "What was it about? Why is it important to me? What can I do with that information?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:53:00">[40:53:00]</a>. This aids both deployment and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00:00">[41:00:00]</a>.
*   **Dissection**: Analyze communication you observe by identifying the structures used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:25:00">[41:25:00]</a>.

### Practice and Feedback
Improving communication, whether spontaneous or planned, requires:
*   **Repetition**: Consistent [[exercises_to_improve_public_speaking_skills | practice]] is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:42:00">[41:42:00]</a>.
*   **Reflection**: Think about what worked and what didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:46:00">[41:46:00]</a>.
*   **Feedback**: Seek [[improving_communication_skills | feedback]] from others, as we are not always the best judges of our own communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>.

#### Resources for Practice:
*   **[[using_games_for_public_speaking_practice | Toast Masters]]**: A great organization for getting "reps" (repetitions) in [[tips_for_improving_public_speaking_and_overcoming_fear | public speaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:00">[43:35:00]</a>. They have a "Table Topics" segment specifically for on-the-spot speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>. Many companies sponsor groups, and it's inexpensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:17:00">[45:17:00]</a>.
*   **[[using_games_for_public_speaking_practice | Improvisation]]**: Helps improve comfort with being present and collaborating, not just being funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:00">[42:49:00]</a>.
*   **Continuing Education**: Many universities offer extension or continuing studies classes open to the public, sometimes virtually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a>.

## Specific Spontaneous Speaking Situations

### Small Talk
Small talk helps form relationships and can lead to significant outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:11:00">[46:11:00]</a>.
*   **Be Interested, Not Interesting**: Focus on setting the other person up for success by asking questions and being engaged, rather than trying to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:44:00">[46:44:00]</a>.
*   **Comparable Disclosure**: Maintain a balance of self-disclosure over time. If one person shares deeply, the other should reciprocate at a similar level to avoid awkwardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:12:00">[47:12:00]</a>. Avoid disclosing too much too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:57:00">[47:57:00]</a>.
*   **Supporting vs. Shifting Responses**:
    *   **Supporting**: Ask questions that encourage the other person to elaborate (e.g., "Oh, did you spend time in San Jose?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:33:00">[48:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Shifting**: Redirect the conversation to yourself (e.g., "Oh, you went to Costa Rica? I went to Hawaii") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:46:00">[48:46:00]</a>.
    *   **Balance**: Aim for more supporting responses than shifting ones, but include some shifting to show you're willing to share and not just interrogate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:57:00">[48:57:00]</a>.

### Giving Feedback
View [[improving_communication_skills | feedback]] as an opportunity to problem-solve collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:53:00">[52:53:00]</a>.
*   **Invite Collaboration**: Avoid "bestowing" your opinion; instead, invite the other person to work together on the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:15:00">[53:15:00]</a>.
*   **"What, So What, Now What" for Feedback**:
    *   **What**: Describe the specific behavior or issue (e.g., "You spoke quicker and with less detail during the implementation plan section") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:07:00">[54:07:00]</a>.
    *   **So What**: Explain the impact or consequence (e.g., "People might think you're not as prepared or are concerned about this part") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:16:00">[54:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Now What**: Suggest a specific action or solution (e.g., "Next time, slow down and include these data points") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:23:00">[54:23:00]</a>.
*   **Four I's Structure**:
    *   **I**nformation: Set the context and specify the behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:04:00">[55:04:00]</a>.
    *   **I**mpact: Explain the impact the behavior had on you, the giver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:10:00">[55:10:00]</a>.
    *   **I**nvitation: Invite the other person to engage in problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:15:00">[55:15:00]</a>.
    *   **I**mplications: Discuss the potential benefits or consequences of addressing the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>.
    *   *Example*: "This is the third time you've showed up late to this meeting (Information). I feel you're not prioritizing this meeting the same way others are (Impact). What can we do to make sure you show up prepared for the next meeting (Invitation)? Because if you do, we're going to finish the project on time and get a new cool project (Implications)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:24:00">[55:24:00]</a>.

### Giving Toasts/Tributes
Toasts and tributes are common [[tips_for_improving_public_speaking_and_overcoming_fear | public speaking]] events.
*   **"WHAT" Acronym**:
    *   **W**hy are we here: Briefly state the purpose of the gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:23:00">[57:23:00]</a>.
    *   **H**ow are you connected: Explain your relationship to the event or person being honored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:42:00">[57:42:00]</a>.
    *   **A**necdote: Share a relevant, concise, and accessible story or example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:03:00">[58:03:00]</a>. This is where you can incorporate the substance of your tribute and show emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.
    *   **T**hanks/Gratitude: Express gratitude and signal closure (e.g., "cheers") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:18:00">[58:18:00]</a>.
*   **Be Brief**: Nobody complains about a toast being too short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:32:00">[59:32:00]</a>.
*   **Test It Out**: For important toasts, practice and get [[improving_communication_skills | feedback]] from a few people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.
*   **Show, Don't Tell Emotion**: Convey emotion through stories and anecdotes rather than directly stating feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.

### Q&A Sessions
Approach Q&A as an opportunity to extend, expand, connect, and learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.
*   **Avoid Pitfalls**:
    *   Don't say "good question" to every question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.
    *   Avoid ending answers with "Does that make sense?" Instead, ask "Did I answer your question?" or "Do you have a follow-up question?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>.
*   **"ADD" Structure**:
    *   **A**nswer: Respond cleanly and concisely to the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.
    *   **D**etailed Example: Provide a concrete example to reinforce your answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
    *   **D**escribe Relevance: Explain the significance or relevance of your answer to the audience. Don't assume they will connect the dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.
    *   *Example*: (Question: "How many students have you worked with and taught over the years?") "I've been doing this for 25 years and have taught thousands of students (Answer). I've taught in both academic and corporate settings (Detailed Example). This means I can tailor my material to be relevant and useful to your students (Describe Relevance)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.

### Apologizing
*   **Take Responsibility**: Apologize for the specific transgression, not for how the other person feels (e.g., "I'm sorry for interrupting," not "I'm sorry that you feel bad") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>.
*   **"AAA" Structure**:
    *   **A**cknowledge: State what you did specifically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>.
    *   **A**ppreciate: Express understanding of the difficulty or impact you caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>.
    *   **A**mend: State a specific action you will take to remedy the situation or prevent it from happening again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.
    *   *Example*: "I'm very sorry for interrupting what you were saying; I overspoke when you were talking (Acknowledge). I can imagine my doing that made you feel bad and that you didn't get your fair share of sharing your point of view (Appreciate). Next time, I will wait until you're done and will paraphrase what you said before I contribute my point (Amend)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.

Ultimately, improving communication is a process that requires initiative, self-compassion, and consistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

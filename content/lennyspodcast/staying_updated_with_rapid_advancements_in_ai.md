Staying current with advancements in [[the_evolving_landscape_of_ai_technology | AI technology]] is challenging due to the rapid pace of development, with new information seemingly emerging daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:49">[03:48:49]</a>. Despite this, it is crucial for product managers (PMs) to understand and leverage [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | AI's impact on product development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:05">[03:29:05]</a>.

## Recommended Resources and Mindset

To stay on top of new and interesting developments in [[the_evolving_landscape_of_ai_technology | AI and machine learning]]:

*   **Newsletters** Subscribing to newsletters is highly impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:03">[04:12:03]</a>. A notable recommendation is "The Download" by MIT Technology Review (tldr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:35">[04:19:35]</a>. Although not exclusively [[the_evolving_landscape_of_ai_technology | AI-centric]], it's believed that in the future, everything will incorporate AI by default, so general technology focus will increasingly include AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:27">[04:25:27]</a>.
*   **Online Blogs & Journals** Regularly read online blogs and journals to understand broader [[new_applications_of_ai_in_startups | applications of AI]] beyond commonly discussed tools like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:11">[05:46:11]</a>.
*   **Academia and Research Blogs** Don't underestimate academic and research blogs, such as arXiv. Many significant AI developments, like ChatGPT, had information available in these venues long before they became mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:38:09">[33:38:09]</a>.
*   **Changing Mindset** PMs should not be overwhelmed or intimidated by [[the_evolving_landscape_of_ai_technology | AI technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:08">[11:43:08]</a>. The key is to shift one's mindset to consider how existing data can be leveraged with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:37">[12:31:37]</a>.

## Practical Steps for PMs

For PMs seeking to build strong AI product management skills:

*   **Understand the AI Product Development Lifecycle** Recognize that [[leveraging_ai_in_product_development | AI product development]] differs significantly from general product development. It often involves managing the problem and seeking a smart solution, which can be a more complex process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26:00">[28:26:00]</a>.
*   **Collaborate with Research Scientists** If working at a company with AI researchers, actively engage with them. Shadow them and dedicate time to understanding their work. This provides immense context and reveals the endless potential of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:21">[29:01:21]</a>. PMs play a crucial role in bridging the gap between research and commercialization, helping to monetize AI innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:07">[34:10:07]</a>.
*   **Learn to Code** While PMs may not need to train or code models directly, understanding the fundamentals of coding and how models are trained is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:44">[24:09:44]</a>. This foundational knowledge builds confidence and understanding of how AI tools work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:15">[24:49:15]</a>.
    *   **Online Courses** Platforms like Coursera offer courses such as "Introduction to AI by Stanford" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:56">[39:39:56]</a>.
    *   **Coding Schools** For those who prefer collaborative learning, options include Career Foundry, General Assembly, and Coding Dojo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:06">[27:06:06]</a>.
*   **Experiment with No-Code Tools** Utilize no-code tools for training models to gain practical experience without extensive coding knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:19">[11:54:19]</a>. Google Cloud's AutoML, for example, allows users to train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal effort, requiring only a dataset of images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:17:41">[39:17:41]</a>.
*   **Start Small and Iterate** Consider hiring a data science intern to explore potential applications of available data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:19">[12:54:19]</a>. Avoid the "shiny object trap" of doing AI for AI's sake; always identify a clear problem or pain point first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:47">[13:19:47]</a>.
*   **Embrace Uncertainty** Working with AI research involves significant uncertainty, as model results may not always align with initial hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:24">[29:51:24]</a>. PMs need to encourage their teams through this process and manage leadership expectations regarding the unpredictability of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:16">[30:00:16]</a>.
*   **Address Data Challenges** Sourcing and acquiring good data for AI models is challenging, often requiring creative collection methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:44">[30:23:44]</a>. The amount of data needed varies greatly depending on the complexity of the AI application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:16">[15:59:16]</a>.
*   **Clarify Career Trajectory** In AI product roles, launches may be less frequent than in traditional product management. It's important to clarify with hiring managers how progress and assessment will be measured in a research-focused environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:42:09">[30:42:09]</a>.

Ultimately, PMs need to flex their "zero-to-one muscle" and become comfortable with the inherent challenges and opportunities in implementing AI solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:47">[31:09:47]</a>. By understanding these aspects, PMs can effectively navigate [[enterprise_adoption_of_ai_technologies | enterprise adoption of AI technologies]] and shape the [[impact_of_ai_tools_on_future_product_development_skills | future of product development skills]].

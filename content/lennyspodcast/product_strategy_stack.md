The **Product Strategy Stack** is a framework designed to de-conflate commonly intertwined terms like "goals," "roadmap," and "strategy" into clearly defined, distinct components [00:18:43]. This system helps individuals and teams understand the framework they should use to make decisions and drive business value [00:19:56].

The core purpose of the stack is to prevent prioritization difficulties and tactical issues from arising due to a lack of deep understanding of the underlying strategy [00:19:16]. By clearly defining each layer, teams can define strategy from top to bottom or debug issues from bottom to top [00:21:32].

## Components of the Product Strategy Stack

The stack consists of five interconnected pieces, working as a coherent system [00:21:27]:

1.  **Company Mission** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>
    *   The change the company (or team/subsidiary) wants to bring to the world [00:20:10].
    *   It is a qualitative, inspirational statement of purpose [00:20:15].
    *   Vision is often considered part of the mission, combining the future world view with the company's role in it [00:22:31].

2.  **Company Strategy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>
    *   The rigorously logical plan the company will use to achieve its mission [00:20:39].
    *   It must be very specific and rigorous, outlining the approach or plan for progress [00:20:45].

3.  **Product Strategy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>
    *   The connective tissue between the company's goals and the day-to-day actions of the product team [00:21:06].
    *   This layer informs the product roadmap [00:21:14].

4.  **Product Roadmap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>
    *   Informed by the product strategy [00:21:16].
    *   Outlines the specific features and initiatives planned for a product.

5.  **Product Goals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>
    *   The ultimate measure of success for the product [00:32:08].
    *   Contrarian viewpoint: Goals come *after* the roadmap, as they measure progress towards a clearly defined destination (strategy) rather than being the starting point for strategy [00:43:03]. Starting with goals can lead to teams focusing solely on moving metrics without understanding *why* or if it aligns with the overall strategy [00:43:09].

## Importance of Visuals in Product Strategy

Strategy documents, especially for products, benefit significantly from visual elements like wireframes [00:24:45]. When strategy is described in words alone, different people often form different interpretations [00:25:00]. Wireframes, even low-fidelity ones, provide a "blueprint" that clearly shows how product pieces are laid out and come together, creating alignment across teams [00:25:05]. This is crucial because most products are ultimately rendered as pixels on a screen [00:25:47].

For Product Managers without direct design support, sketching ideas on paper or using tools like Balsamiq (a fast wireframing tool) can be highly effective in visually thinking through the product and defining its strategy [00:27:02]. Understanding UX and UI is a critical part of being a Product Manager [00:27:57].

## Debugging and Defining Strategy

The stack allows for two main approaches:
*   **Defining Strategy (Top-Down):** Starting from the company mission, defining the strategy, then the product strategy, which informs the roadmap, and finally, the goals [00:21:32].
*   **Debugging Strategy (Bottom-Up):** If goals are not being met, investigate if the roadmap is appropriately set up [00:21:41]. If the roadmap is off, check if the product strategy is clearly articulated [00:21:48]. If the product strategy is incorrect, it might be due to a lack of understanding of the company's strategy or mission [00:21:53].

## Examples

### Tinder vs. Hinge

The [[Product Positioning Strategy | product positioning strategy]] of dating apps Tinder and Hinge offers a compelling example of the Product Strategy Stack in action [00:29:08].

*   **Company Mission:**
    *   **Hinge:** "Designed to be deleted." Their mission is to help users find a long-term relationship and leave the app, viewing deletion as a success [00:29:42].
    *   **Tinder:** "Make single life more fun." Tinder aims to be a continuous app on users' phones throughout their single lives, particularly in their 20s and early 30s [00:29:57].

*   **Company Strategy:**
    *   **Monetization:** Both are freemium models with similar monetized features (e.g., subscriptions, microtransactions) [00:30:31].
    *   **Customer Acquisition:**
        *   **Hinge:** Heavily relies on television advertisements [00:30:46].
        *   **Tinder:** Focuses on influencer marketing and event-based marketing [00:30:53].

*   **Product Strategy:**
    *   **Tinder:** Built as the original swipe-based dating app for a lightweight experience: fast swiping, easy matching, easy chatting [00:31:07].
    *   **Hinge:** One of the first successful post-swipe dating apps, deliberately avoiding swiping. It encourages users to spend more time on profiles through prompts that spark deeper conversations, leading to long-term relationships [00:31:21]. This also explains why Tinder resisted adding extensive filters, as they wanted people to get to know each other rather than treating the app as a search engine based on criteria [00:33:17].

*   **Product Roadmap:**
    *   Some similarities: Both invested significantly in video chat post-pandemic [00:31:54].
    *   Differences: Driven by their unique product strategies. Tinder's product has features like "Super Likes" (3x more likely to match) and "Boosts" (increase profile visibility), and more recently, "Platinum" and "Super Like with a note" (allowing a first message before matching) [00:35:08]. These features cater to users who want to accelerate the meeting process, aligning with Tinder's "fun single life" mission.

*   **Product Goals:**
    *   High-level similarity: Both measure success based on "meaningful conversations" (matching and chatting) [00:32:11].
    *   Detailed differences: The specific product mechanics to achieve those conversations vary greatly based on their respective strategies [00:32:19].

## Goals and the "Frontier of Understanding"

When setting goals, especially with frameworks like OKRs, it's crucial to understand the "frontier of understanding" â€“ the boundary between what the team knows and doesn't know [00:48:46]. While the ultimate goal is to drive outcomes, committing to a specific outcome when the path to achieve it is unclear can be problematic [00:48:35].

Instead of just committing to an outcome, goals should reflect the current type of risk or uncertainty [00:49:27]:

1.  **Understanding Risk:** When a team doesn't know what levers move a particular metric (e.g., "we don't know what moves retention") [00:49:29]. The appropriate goal is to *increase understanding*, not necessarily move the metric itself [00:49:34].
2.  **Dependency Risk:** When the team understands the levers but lacks the necessary tools or resources to make progress [00:50:42].
3.  **Execution Risk:** When the team has the resources and a strong hypothesis but may struggle to execute consistently or flawlessly [00:50:51]. An execution goal might be "hit 20 experiments this quarter" [00:49:50].
4.  **Strategic Risk:** When a hypothesis exists, and execution is strong, but the hypothesis itself might turn out to be incorrect [00:51:01].

This approach helps teams understand *why* they might miss a goal (e.g., "we missed our goal, but we now understand why, and here's our plan for next quarter") [00:52:37]. It shifts focus from solely outcome-driven goals to a process of continuous learning and strategic alignment.

### Selective Micromanagement

In the context of product leadership, the idea of "selective micromanagement" is presented as an [[challenges_and_strategies_in_product_management | effective product management strategy]] [01:08:24]. While constant micromanagement can be detrimental, a completely hands-off approach can also lead to teams veering off track due to lack of context or guardrails [01:06:52].

Selective micromanagement involves temporarily taking away some team autonomy to steer them in the correct direction when confidence in their direction is low [01:08:25]. The goal is to set the team on the right track and provide the necessary frameworks, then pull back to a scalable leadership mode where the team has autonomy and the leader has confidence [01:08:45]. This contrasts with "micro-mismanagement," where control is exerted without a clear end or confidence, leading to frustration [01:09:05].

### [[AI product management strategies | AI product management strategies]]

AI can amplify human capabilities, rather than replace them. For instance, in coaching, AI can analyze text content from participants and generate suggestions for coaches, allowing them to provide more efficient and tailored feedback [01:13:50]. Different coaching styles (action-oriented, sympathetic, inquisitive, informative) can even be simulated through different AI prompts [01:14:10].

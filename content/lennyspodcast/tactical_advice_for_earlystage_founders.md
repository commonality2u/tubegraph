Dalton Caldwell, Managing Director and Group Partner at Y Combinator, has worked with over 21 YC batches, including early days of companies like Instacart, Retool, Brex, DoorDash, and Webflow, giving him extensive experience with a vast number of startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>. His advice to founders is often simple and pragmatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: "Don't Die" and Persistence

Caldwell emphasizes fundamental advice: "Sell, make money, don't run out of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. His core mantra for founders is simply "just don't die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This constant affirmation to [[challenges_of_managing_a_startup | keep going]] and perform "high-quality reps" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Many successful startup stories, including that of Airbnb, involve founders pushing through points where they rationally "should have given up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. It's often an "irrational act" to keep working on a startup when "everything was wrong" and it "objectively wasn't working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This persistence, even when feeling "completely defeated," is a common theme across YC's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Founders frequently experience "near-death experiences" before achieving success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Knowing When to Pivot or Quit

Deciding when to give up is a nuanced [[challenges_of_managing_a_startup | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Caldwell suggests asking:
*   "Are you still having fun?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
*   Do you "enjoy spending time with your co-founders?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>
*   Do you "love your customers and... your product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>

If the answer is yes, leaning towards "keep going" is often the right choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. However, if the startup is "profoundly affecting you in a negative way" or impacting relationships, it might be time to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Founders often fear failure, but "no one will remember that you shut down your company probably in 10 years or 20 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Life is short, and forcing yourself to work on something you hate to "avoid losing face" is a "big opportunity cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

A good indicator for when to [[earlystage_startup_challenges_and_solutions | pivot]] is when the founder has run "out of ideas" on how to make it grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. If there are still "half a dozen or a dozen really good grow ideas" that haven't been tried, it's worth continuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

### What Makes a Good Pivot?
A successful pivot generally "gets warmer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This means it moves closer to something the founder is already an expert at and "builds on what you learned on the prior idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. For example:
*   **Brex:** Pivoted from a VR headset company to fintech, building on their prior fintech experience in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   **Retool:** Pivoted from a P2P Venmo competitor (Cashew) to building internal tools, leveraging their experience creating dashboards for Cashew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   **Segment:** Learned about analytics while running their first idea, then pivoted to a mixed-panel competitor, and finally to their successful JavaScript event-sending tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Founders don't always start with the final idea; often, the "unique insights" are a "side effect of their earlier ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Identifying Promising Ideas and Avoiding Pitfalls

### "Tarpit Ideas"
Caldwell warns against "tarpit ideas" – concepts that seem like "unsolved problems" and generate "lots of positive feedback," yet many people have been trying them for decades without success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. The danger is that they can "get good initial validation," drawing founders in and getting them stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

Examples of tarpit ideas include:
*   Apps to coordinate with friends for social outings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   Music discovery platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
*   Foursquare clones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

### Seeking Unique Opportunities
Founders often have the "same information diet" as others, leading to similar startup ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. To find "gold," founders should "go more off the beaten path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. This could be by drawing on "personal experience" or "personal interest" to find something unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

A tactical approach suggested to the Zip founders was to look for "publicly traded" or private equity-owned companies that are "large and that also are hated by their customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. This identifies a "knowable big market with an incumbent" whose "software is horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

### YC's Request for Startups
Y Combinator publishes a "Request for Startups" to inspire founders to explore new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:22">[00:52:22]</a>. Examples of ideas YC is interested in funding include:
*   ERPs (Enterprise Resource Planning software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>.
*   Open source companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.
*   Space companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.
*   Ways to end cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.
*   Spatial computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.
*   New defense technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.
*   Bringing manufacturing back to America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.
*   Better Enterprise glue (software to connect Business Systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.
*   Small fine-tuned models as alternatives to gigantic generic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

## Engaging with Customers Effectively

A common reason startups fail is that they don't talk to customers and don't find product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. Founders often "lose hope" when they haven't talked to customers or built a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.

To effectively talk to customers:
*   **Get out in the world:** Talk to people "in person" and don't "hide behind your keyboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.
*   **Overcome shyness:** Founders often avoid this due to "social anxiety" and fear of "looking stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. Power through the awkwardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.
*   **Allocate time:** At least 20% to 30% of a founder's calendar should be dedicated to "customer meeting, customer call" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>. Nothing substitutes for "an actual conversation versus just staring at analytics dashboards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.
*   **Persistence in sales:** Even after a "yes" from a customer, the sale isn't done until the product is implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. Stripe's founders famously did "Collinson installs," showing up to customers' offices to help them implement their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

## Building and Scaling Your Team (and Avoiding Over-delegation)

[[earlystage_startup_challenges_and_solutions | Earlystage startup challenges and solutions]] often include the trap of over-delegating and hiring "super senior people with fancy resumés really early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. Founders, especially first-timers, can take their "eye off the ball" by hiring executives too soon, often pressured by investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>.

Founders who are "really great at product" are "always deeply in the weeds" and "still talking to customers no matter how late stage it gets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. You "can't delegate caring about your users and you can't delegate caring that the product is great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. Prioritize by being "obsessed with product" rather than spending "tons and tons of time... hanging out with investors and networking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.

## Understanding Investor Psychology

When investors say no, it's often not personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. Put yourself in their shoes: they only make a few investments a year and are looking for something that "can be truly phenomenally big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. They simply might not be excited enough to choose *that* investment over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

Market size (TAM) is "absolutely critical" for later-stage investors, but "the earlier you go the less it matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Early-stage investors like Caldwell prioritize questions like "how do you get users" and "how do you grow," focusing on whether founders are "making something people want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>.

## Key Traits of Successful Founders

Successful founders don't adhere to a single personality type; they can be quiet or extroverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. The common thread among those who build large companies is a profound internal belief: they "really want it," "really believe in themselves," and are convinced they "can make it work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. There's a deep-seated feeling of being "the one" and an unwillingness to accept failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. This "internal gravitational force" can "warp the world to bend to that will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a>.

This conviction isn't always present at the very beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>. Instead, it "builds conviction" as the product gains traction, creating a "network effect virtual cycle" as "customers reflect back to you and data reflects back to you that you're on the right track" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.

## Getting Started: Pre-selling and Validation

For those starting a startup, Caldwell advises:
1.  **Talk to potential customers and try to pre-sell something *before* you write code** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.
2.  **Focus on [[early_stage_sales_tactics_for_startups | customer validation]] first** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>, rather than building a PowerPoint deck or trying to raise money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.
3.  **A "green light" to do a startup** comes when you find people who are "really excited" and you "do line up customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>.
4.  **Start building once you have conviction** that "at least one person would use this thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>.

## Contrarian Advice: Growth Hacking

::: info Contrarian Corner
Dalton Caldwell believes that "growth and [[advising_and_growth_hacking_for_startups | growth hacking]] and doing all this analytics AB testing stuff" is a "total waste of time for very early startups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>. He argues that much of the startup advice online is geared towards later-stage companies (Series A/B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>. Early-stage founders who consume this advice can become confused, leading to an "ant pattern" where they engage in "complex growth hacking theory" instead of focusing on "getting a first customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>. If you have "no users," focusing on advanced analytics or split testing is "actively not helpful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

The Facebook News Feed, a product that became synonymous with the platform, was one of the first impactful projects developed by Andrew Bosworth, or "Boz," who joined Facebook in early 2006 as one of its initial engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. Now Meta's Chief Technology Officer, Boz played a crucial role in creating what he considers one of the most significant products in internet history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Conception and Impact
The Facebook News Feed was the first ever algorithmically ranked content feed on any social network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. It is essentially what people associate with Facebook today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. The product also included the first consumer AI embedded in a website that ranked content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:53">[03:53:53]</a>. The combination of the News Feed and ads has generated trillions of dollars in value, which Boz correlates with human utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>.

## Initial Controversy and User Reaction
Despite its eventual success, the News Feed was met with significant user outrage upon its launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:46">[03:46:46]</a>. People initially did not want this level of shared information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

However, the user reaction presented a paradox:
> "Everyone was outraged at the same time as they immediately doubled their usage of the product in terms of the economic utility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
> "It was literally like everyone was like I hate this so much and they would refresh refresh refresh and so we like okay wait this is a there's cognitive dissonance here uh between what the stated preferences and what the revealed preferences are in the economic sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:55">[03:55:55]</a>

Boz noted that while the team "did screw some things up" in the execution, the core idea of the News Feed was correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:58">[03:58:58]</a>. One mistake was amplifying wall posts, which were previously accessible but not "on blast" on the main feed, leading to user discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:50">[03:50:50]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from News Feed Development
The experience taught several key lessons for [[innovations_in_product_design_and_user_experience | product development]]:
*   **Conviction**: Developers need conviction in what they are building, as customers are "choosing you as much as your customers are choosing you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>.
*   **Balancing User Feedback and Vision**: While user feedback is important, sometimes a product's vision aligns with a larger market beyond the initial user cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>. It's crucial to distinguish between fundamental product flaws and issues with details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>.
*   **Market Hostage**: Startups should be cautious not to be "held hostage by their earliest customers" if those needs diverge from a larger market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:29">[03:29:29]</a>.
*   **Intuition and Diagnosis**: When user data isn't clear, a strong vision and intuition are needed to diagnose the difference between expected and actual outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:24">[03:24:24]</a>.

## Personal Impact on Andrew Bosworth
The News Feed project deeply consumed Boz, opening his eyes to the truth that passion leads to better, smarter, and significantly more productive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>. He realized he was "a guy who gets excited about things" once he dives into them, a gift that allows him to find passion even in areas he initially resisted, like ads or hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a>. This willingness to learn aggressively and move to new roles when not learning enough has shaped his unusual career arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:31">[04:31:31]</a>. He advises optimizing for learning in early career stages, viewing it as a compound interest investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:35">[04:35:35]</a>.

The experience of building the News Feed highlighted the intense dedication required in the early days of Facebook. Boz recalls working 120 hours per week with no hobbies, limited sleep, and personal sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. He had to wake up every four hours for two years to check reports and defend the site from attacks, a task nobody even asked him to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>. This period of intense work, while romanticized in hindsight, was far from glamorous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. This highlights some of the [[challenges_of_scaling_consumer_social_apps | challenges of scaling consumer social apps]] from an engineering perspective.

## Early Innovations and Core Technologies
Beyond the News Feed, Boz also helped build the original Facebook mobile ads platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>, the Facebook messaging system, user profiles, the timeline, Facebook Groups, and even the internal engineering boot camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>. These foundational projects underscore his significant contribution to the platform's core functionalities, many of which are key to [[growth_tactics_at_facebook_and_meta | Meta's growth strategies]].

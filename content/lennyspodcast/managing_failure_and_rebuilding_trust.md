Leaders often face situations where projects fail, especially at high-stakes companies. Recovering from such setbacks requires a specific approach to rebuild trust and continue career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon, shares his experience of failing on an important project for Jeff Bezos and the lessons learned.

## The App Store Launch Failure

During the launch of Amazon's App Store, Ethan Evans, then a director responsible for the launch, experienced a critical failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. The product emphasized a "test drive" feature, allowing users to try apps in a web browser simulator before downloading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. On launch day, the feature wasn't working, despite the team working all night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

At 6:15 a.m., Jeff Bezos inquired about the product launch letter. Ethan responded that they were "working on a few problems," hoping for more time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>. However, Bezos's follow-up "What problems?" escalated the situation, leading to an explanation of a database issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>. Bezos was frustrated, questioning the use of an Oracle database instead of AWS, and copied Ethan's boss and other leaders, causing the anger to snowball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.

## Strategies for Recovery

### 1. Own the Problem and Communicate Proactively

The first step in recovering from a significant failure is to take [[building_trust_as_a_product_leader | ownership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. Ethan immediately admitted the issue and committed to dealing with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>. He then began providing very proactive, hourly updates to Bezos, detailing the current status, planned actions, and when the next update would be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. This strategy aimed to rebuild trust hour by hour and prevent micromanagement from higher levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.

### 2. Seek Help and Fix the Issue

In crisis, colleagues and leaders may offer support. In Ethan's case, Andy Jassy's (then AWS leader) team and CTO Werner Vogels offered assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. They identified fundamental design mistakes in the database usage and provided 500 AWS machines as an immediate fix to allow the system to run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>. This highlights the importance of working hard and fast to fix the problem, even if it requires extra effort, like working through a weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.

### 3. Face the Fallout Head-On

Despite fixing the problem, Jeff Bezos remained frustrated due to the missed media opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. He lost trust and personally checked the system for bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>. A few days later, Ethan had a pre-scheduled meeting with Bezos on another topic. Although he considered skipping it due to Bezos's anger, he realized, "if I can't face the CEO, I'd better pack my desk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. He sat next to Bezos, and at the end of the meeting, Bezos initiated a human conversation, acknowledging the difficult week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. This face-to-face interaction is crucial because expressing anger in person is harder than through emails, which can help [[handling_fear_and_anger_in_leadership | rebuild relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

### 4. Overcome Impostor Syndrome and Persist

Many leaders experience impostor syndrome and fear that one big mistake will end their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>. Ethan's experience demonstrates that even a monumental public failure with the CEO does not necessarily mean the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. It requires [[resilience_and_perseverance_in_startups | stubbornness]] and a refusal to "live in shame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>.

Indeed, Ethan's boss's boss, Jeff Wilke, considered firing him due to the mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>. Wilke emphasized that prioritizing a launch date over Amazon's reputation was a mistake, but acknowledged that Ethan knew he was taking a risk. Had he not known, his departure would have been discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. This highlights that transparency about risks, even when they fail, can be a saving grace.

Within two years of this public failure, Ethan was promoted to Vice President, having re-earned trust by demonstrating he had learned lessons about launching reliably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.

## Key Takeaways from Failure

*   **Prioritize long-term reputation over short-term dates**: While speed matters, balance it with reliability, especially in high-visibility contexts. Surprising launches can lead to being surprised by what doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. Beta testing and controlled releases, even if they risk leaks, are preferable to public failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>.
*   **Support your team**: A junior engineer was responsible for the core bug that caused the App Store failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. The team failed to provide adequate help or oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>. The engineer left the company shortly after, likely due to feeling undue responsibility. Ethan regrets not reaching out to reassure him that the system failed him, not just his code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.

## Ownership as a Leadership Principle

Ethan Evans contributed to crafting one of Amazon's 14 core leadership principles: **Ownership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. During a revision of Amazon's principles, ownership was initially removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. Ethan and a group of directors advocated for its inclusion, proposing the famous phrase: **"An owner never says that's not my job."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a> This phrase became a part of the leadership principle and remains to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>. This demonstrates how individual contributions, even in large organizations, can have a massive impact if the ideas are strong and championed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>.

This principle is vital because leaders are hiring people to solve problems and make an impact, not just to do work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. An owner understands the business and contributes to its success, solving big problems and changing company or customer outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

Direct feedback is essential for growth and effective collaboration, but many organizational cultures present significant barriers to its successful implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>. These barriers can manifest as a general unwillingness to be candid, fear of negative repercussions, or ingrained biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.

## Common Cultural Barriers

### Ruinous Empathy
The most prevalent issue in workplaces is "ruinous empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. This occurs when individuals remember to show they care personally, but are so worried about hurting someone's feelings or offending them that they fail to deliver direct, constructive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This false sense of harmony can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

!!! quote | The Bob Story
Kim Scott shares an example from her career where she failed to give a popular employee, Bob, direct feedback on his poor work performance for 10 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. Her reluctance stemmed from liking Bob and not wanting to hurt his feelings (ruinous empathy), combined with a fear that if he got upset, her reputation as a leader would suffer (manipulative insincerity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. This inaction ultimately led to Bob's termination and frustration among the high-performing team members who had to re-do his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Bob himself asked, "Why didn't anyone tell me? I thought you all cared about me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. This illustrates how ruinous empathy can be more painful in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

### Obnoxious Aggression
At the other end of the spectrum is "obnoxious aggression," where individuals challenge directly but fail to show they care personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This is problematic because it hurts others and is inefficient, as people in a "fight or flight" mode literally cannot hear what is being said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. A major misconception is that [[techniques_for_managing_and_delivering_feedback|Radical Candor]] encourages obnoxious aggression; it does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Individual Tendencies that Become Cultural
*   **People-Pleasing**: Many individuals are "recovering people-pleasers" who find it difficult to give hard feedback because they want to be liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. This personal tendency can contribute to a culture of ruinous empathy if widespread. Overcoming this involves prioritizing care for others over the need to be liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
*   **Likability-Competence Bias**: Women, especially, may face a bias where being direct can lead to accusations of being "bossy" or "abrasive," pushing them towards less direct communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **Fear of Upsetting Others**: Anticipating negative emotional reactions (sadness, anger, tears) can deter individuals from giving feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. There is often a "negativity bias" where the perceived negative reaction is worse than what actually happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.
*   **Low Self-Awareness in Leaders**: Some leaders with low [[importance_of_feedback_and_selfawareness_in_career_growth|self-awareness]] might believe obnoxious aggression is the only way to get results, or they might simply ignore problems and fire people without providing any [[providing_constructive_feedback|constructive feedback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.
*   **Lack of Psychological Safety**: If people feel that giving feedback is "wasting their breath" because it won't be acted upon, or if there's a fear of retaliation, they will stop giving feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.
*   **Time Constraints**: The perceived lack of time to have "two-minute impromptu moments of management" can prevent immediate feedback delivery, leading to bigger issues later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.

## Overcoming Cultural Barriers

To shift a culture towards more direct feedback, it's crucial to begin by soliciting criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. This builds relationships and makes it easier to give and receive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.

### Key Strategies:

1.  **Ask the Right Questions**: Instead of a generic "Do you have any feedback for me?" (which often elicits "no, everything's fine"), ask specific questions like:
    *   "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>
    *   "Tell me why I'm wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>
    *   "What's one thing I could be doing better?" or "What's one way I could be helping you be more successful?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>
    *   "What could I have done this week to better support you in your work?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>

    Ensure the question sounds authentic to you, or people won't believe you genuinely want an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

2.  **Embrace Discomfort and Silence**: Be prepared for discomfort and allow for silence (e.g., counting to six) after asking for feedback, as this often prompts a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

3.  **Listen to Understand, Not to Respond**: Your initial reaction might be defensiveness, but focus on understanding the feedback by asking follow-up questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

4.  **Reward the Candor**:
    *   If you agree with the feedback, fix the problem and make your actions tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.
    *   If you disagree, acknowledge the part you agree with, then state you need to think about the rest and will follow up with a respectful explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. Disagreement itself does not risk relationships; unspoken disagreement does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

5.  **Address Leaders with Low Self-Awareness**: Explain the negative impact their current style has on results and their own careers, appealing to their "enlightened self-interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. Share personal stories of your own mistakes to encourage their [[importance_of_feedback_and_selfawareness_in_career_growth|self-awareness]] and adoption of a growth mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

6.  **Foster Authentic Leadership**: Focus on genuinely caring about people and doing the right thing for them, rather than seeking to be liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. Recognize that it's actually unkind in the long run not to tell someone when they are making a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

7.  **Prioritize Feedback Time**: Integrate feedback into daily/weekly routines, such as reserving five minutes at the end of one-on-ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. Deliver timely, impromptu feedback, even if it means being a couple of minutes late to the next meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. These "moments of management" are more important than strict adherence to schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

By proactively addressing these [[challenges_of_feedback_in_the_workplace|challenges of feedback in the workplace]], organizations can move beyond cultural barriers to create environments where [[providing_effective_feedback|effective feedback]] thrives, leading to better relationships and improved work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

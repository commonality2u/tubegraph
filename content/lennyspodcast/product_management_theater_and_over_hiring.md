Product management theater refers to a phenomenon where companies create numerous, often unnecessary, product-related roles, leading to inflated payrolls and a focus on output rather than actual outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This trend is exacerbated by over-hiring, particularly seen during the pandemic, and a lowered hiring bar for these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Causes of Product Management Theater

Several factors contribute to the rise of product management theater and the over-hiring of product roles:

*   **Pandemic Over-hiring** Many companies significantly over-hired during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.
*   **Lowered Hiring Bar** Along with over-hiring, the quality bar for new hires was often lowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Financial Changes** A shift in the financial world has increased the cost of funds, pressuring companies to scrutinize expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Impact of Generative AI** The predicted impact of generative AI creates uncertainty among leaders, suggesting that certain roles may become redundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. For instance, the CEO of Nvidia suggested not learning programming, highlighting the potential for AI to disrupt even technical fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   **Excessive Team Sizes** Especially outside Silicon Valley, team sizes have become "out of hand," with an abundance of roles like agile coaches, [[Product management skills and best practices | product owners]], [[Product management and storytelling | product ops]], and business analysts, often serving as "assistant product manager types" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. There's a growing appreciation that smaller teams can be more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   **Remote Work** While not advocating for a return to fully co-located teams, the shift to remote work has impacted velocity and innovation, as things often move slower and deep innovation is harder to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Over-reliance on Processes** Many companies, particularly outside the "Silicon Valley bubble," invest heavily in processes like SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) and overly complex interpretations of Scrum, often missing the core point of agile methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Lack of Outcomes** Companies often have little to show in terms of actual outcomes despite significant costs and a high number of personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This waste is often "embarrassing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

## Symptoms and Consequences

### Project Management vs. Product Management
A key symptom of product management theater is when individuals holding the title of product manager are, in essence, performing [[Challenges in transitioning to product management | project management]] roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These individuals are "dramatically overpaid for the value they provide" because their focus is on delivering *output* (features, projects) rather than *outcomes* (solving customer or business problems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. It is "a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Feature Teams vs. Empowered Product Teams
This distinction is central to understanding product management theater:

*   **Feature Teams:** In this model, teams are given a "road map of output," meaning specific features or projects to design, build, test, and deploy, often with strict dates and timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. The measure of success is simply shipping the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. In such teams, genuine product managers are often unnecessary because the role becomes one of [[Challenges in transitioning to product management | project management]], which other roles (like senior engineers) could often cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. When asked to define their job, these product managers might give "mealy mouth, squishy" answers like "facilitate," "communicate," or "herd cats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

*   **Empowered Product Teams:** These teams are given specific customer or business *problems to solve* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. The measure of success is whether the problem is actually solved, focusing on *outcomes* rather than just shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. This requires a [[Product management skills and best practices | product manager]] who understands "value and viability" â€“ ensuring the solution is not only usable and feasible but also valuable for customers and viable for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. An empowered product manager is a "creator," not merely a facilitator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

### Broader Dislike of Product Managers
A growing trend sees a general dislike for product managers, particularly in startups, stemming from negative experiences with individuals hired as product managers who were not effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. This is often because they were operating in a feature team model where a "real" product manager's value is not apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

### Vulnerability to Layoffs
Individuals in "delivery team product owner" or "feature team product manager" roles are often the "most vulnerable people in a company" during layoffs, as companies realize these roles aren't providing the expected value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. Generative AI is expected to "compound this" trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.

### Perpetuation of Misinformation
Much of the content available online, including certifications, articles, books, and conference speakers, propagates a "feature team world" model, leading new product managers astray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Well-meaning individuals in product communities often share what they've learned at their "crappy company," inadvertently "self-propagating" ineffective practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

### Misunderstanding of Empowerment
Empowerment does not mean product teams decide what to work on, which would lead to "anarchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>. Instead, it means [[Product management and leadership insights | product leaders]] set the strategic direction and "bets," and then teams are empowered to "figure out the best way to solve those problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

## The Role of a Real Product Manager

A "real" product manager is a [[Product management and storytelling | creator]] responsible for ensuring a solution is not only usable and feasible but also **valuable** (for the customer) and **viable** (for the business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. Key skills include:

*   **Deep Customer Understanding** Becoming an expert on users and customers, often through direct engagement like visiting customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Data Expertise** Understanding how the product is used, how usage changes, and how it is purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
*   **Business Acumen** Representing and understanding compliance, sales, marketing, financial costs, monetization, legal constraints, and go-to-market strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
*   **Market Knowledge** Possessing a deep understanding of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
*   **Critical Thinking** The ability to critically evaluate information and make sound judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.

These skills are distinct from simply managing a backlog in Jira, which is analogous to "learning how to operate Google Docs" rather than doing the actual job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

## [[Product management career growth framework | Transitioning into Product Management]] Beyond Theater

Individuals stuck in feature teams have "a lot more agency than they realize" to transform their roles and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

*   **Upleveling Skills** Product managers should focus on developing the skills needed for "real" product management, particularly in value and viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. This can lead to internal promotion and a more appreciated role within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.
*   **Critical Evaluation of Resources** Given the prevalence of misleading online content, product people must "think critically" and "use their judgment" when seeking advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.
*   **Product Operating Model** The book *Transformed* introduces the "product operating model," a conceptual framework of 20 principles consistently used by the best product companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>. These principles include emphasizing innovation over predictability, valuing learning over failure, and embracing rapid experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>. It also highlights four key competencies for successful product teams: a real [[the_art_and_role_of_product_management | product manager]], a real product designer, a real tech lead, and a real [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | product leader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Founder's Role in Early Stages** For startups, the founder should typically act as the product person, focusing on value and viability, until the company reaches a certain scale (e.g., 20-25 engineers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. Hiring a "real" product manager too soon can create conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.

### Addressing Product Ops
Product Ops is more analogous to Dev Ops or Design Ops. In effective companies, the core of Product Ops involves user research and data analysts, typically brought together under one leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. This function aims to provide high-leverage support to multiple teams. However, some companies misuse Product Ops, focusing on "process and governance" or using it to justify giving product managers "assistants" or to offload the product leaders' responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

Ultimately, the transformation towards effective product management requires companies to "take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers," observing how top companies achieve more with less proportional spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.

Ian McAllister, author of the influential post "What separates a top one percent PM from a top 10 pm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, has managed over 100 product managers during his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. He spent 12 years at Amazon, built Amazon Smile, led international expansion for Alexa, worked at Airbnb, and currently leads Global Product for Uber's vehicles platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

McAllister's insights on [[product_management_skills_and_best_practices | product management skills]] have been highly influential for many, including Lenny Rachitsky, host of Lenny's Podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The act of writing online, such as McAllister's description of Amazon's [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | working backwards process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, can significantly impact one's career trajectory and foster valuable industry connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Writing also serves as a tool for clear thinking and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Core Attributes of a Top Product Manager
A successful product manager needs a diverse set of [[key_skills_and_traits_for_product_managers | skills]] and [[traits_and_skills_for_successful_product_managers | traits]]. While no single PM excels at all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, McAllister highlights several key areas:
*   **Think big** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
*   **Communicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>
*   **Simplify**: Achieve more with less impact by simplifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Prioritize**: Considered a core skill, involving decisions on themes, projects, sequencing, and even time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
*   **Forecast and measure**: Crucial for building instincts and validating efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Execute**: Shipping and delivering on commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Understand technical trade-offs**: Aids in simplifying and maximizing resource yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Understand good design**: Helps in thinking from the customer's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Write effective copy**: Important for concise customer communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Earned trust**: Essential for growing as a product leader; trust is the "currency" of a PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Digging for data**: Developing tools to find and analyze data independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Pushing back effectively**: Correlates with ability to grow as a leader; saying "yes" to everything leads nowhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Adapting to change**: Impacts morale and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Driven by impact, not promotion**: Focusing on impact leads to career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

### Top Attributes for New PMs
For new product managers, the primary focus should be on three core building blocks:
1.  **Communicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>: Continuously strive to be a better communicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. This includes answering questions directly, using numbers, and learning from feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. An important tactical tip is to "Answer First and then explain" or even "Answer and then shut up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Self-reflection after communication instances also aids improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
2.  **Prioritize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>: This is the number one key tool for a PM, encompassing project, theme, and time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. An innate ability to prioritize can generate five times the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.
3.  **Execute** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>: Shipping and delivering on commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. This involves molding ideas into impactful, compact packages and ensuring the team (designers, data scientists, engineers) is resourced and performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. PMs are the "motive power" behind execution and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

New PMs should learn as much as possible but focus less on "think big," "understand technical trade-offs," and "understand good design" early on, as these become more critical later in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. It's also beneficial for junior PMs to seek out projects that are likely to have high impact, especially those that drive the business ("offense") rather than just mitigate risks or optimize costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

### Top Attributes for Senior PMs
For senior product managers, continued growth involves:
1.  **Communicate**: Still paramount, but with higher stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.
2.  **Think big**: Actively hunt for larger impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. When developing ideas, always ask if they could be bigger and more impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. This also means taking a wider view of what success for your product entails, extending beyond traditional product scope to influence other functions like marketing, treating yourself as a "GM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.
3.  **Earned trust**: Becomes even more crucial at senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Trust is the currency for gaining resources and advancing in a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Trust is built by consistently setting and meeting expectations, telling the truth, owning mistakes, and fostering alignment with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. Losing trust happens by lying, being evasive, or repeating mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
4.  **Driven by impact, not promotion**: Focusing daily on having the biggest impact for the business or team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. This focus naturally leads to promotion and career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. For junior PMs, impact is "nice to have," but for senior PMs, it's the primary evaluation metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.

### The Importance of Impact and Self-Awareness
McAllister emphasizes that consistently striving for impact, rather than solely focusing on career advancement, is a powerful guiding light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This [[the_importance_of_high_agency_for_product_managers | high agency]] approach naturally leads to promotions and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. The ability to reflect on past experiences and identify areas for improvement, maintaining a "continuous improvement mindset," is a valuable muscle for any PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. This self-awareness helps in addressing [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | challenges and responsibilities]] throughout one's product career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.

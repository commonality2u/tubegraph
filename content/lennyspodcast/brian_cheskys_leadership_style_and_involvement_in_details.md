Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, has developed a distinct leadership style characterized by deep involvement in product details, a focus on clarity and cohesion, and a commitment to continuous growth and learning. His approach has evolved, particularly in response to company challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Emphasis on Clarity and Detail

Chesky believes that many founders "apologize for how they want to run the company," leading to a "midpoint" that makes everyone miserable. Instead, he asserts that what employees truly desire is [[Importance of clarity and direction in leadership | clarity]] and the ability to "row in the same direction really quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

He distinguishes between "micromanagement" – telling people exactly what to do – and "being in the details," which he considers essential for responsible leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Being in the details allows a leader to understand if people are performing well, challenging the notion that a great leader's only job is to hire and empower without oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This philosophy led him to immerse himself in every product detail at Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## CEO as Chief Product Officer

Chesky views the CEO of a product or tech company as essentially the Chief Product Officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. He found that when he was less involved in projects, there was more "spin," less clear goals, and fewer resources for teams, ultimately leading to slower progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. His decision to become more hands-on was a conscious move to regain control and drive the product effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## Transformation During Crisis

Before the pandemic, Airbnb had become increasingly slow and bureaucratic, with rising costs and slowing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. The company had adopted a "divisional" structure, with 10 different divisions operating independently, leading to internal politics, bureaucracy, dependencies, and a lack of accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

The "near-death business experience" during the pandemic, when Airbnb lost 80% of its business in eight weeks, provided Chesky with "clarity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. This crisis allowed him to implement significant changes:

*   **Reduced Project Load:** Projects were dramatically cut, focusing on doing "20% of these things" to ensure better execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.
*   **Functional Model:** Airbnb shifted from a divisional to a functional model, akin to a startup, with core functions like design, engineering, product marketing, marketing, and communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Fewer, More Senior Employees:** The company aimed for fewer, more senior employees, believing that adding more people can slow down a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
*   **Expert Leadership:** Executives were required to be experts in their functional domains, managing both the work and the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.
*   **Centralized Decision-Making:** Decision-making was pulled in, rather than pushed down, creating "one shared consciousness" among top leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
*   **Calendar-Driven Roadmap:** A rolling two-year product roadmap, updated every month, became subordinate to the calendar, focusing on consistent bi-annual product launches (May and November/October) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.
*   **CEO Review Schedule:** Chesky initiated weekly CEO reviews of all products and marketing, tracking project status (green, yellow, red) and identifying bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. This eliminated the need for managing by influence or formal conflict resolution, as issues were addressed directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Integrated Product Marketing:** The product management function was reimagined into "product marketing," combining inbound product development with outbound marketing responsibilities. This ensured that building a product included knowing how to talk about and distribute it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Design and Engineering Alignment:** A key focus was ensuring close alignment between engineering and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, and having design and engineering report directly to the product-led founder (CEO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>. He emphasized that design should not be treated as a "service organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Unified Writing:** UX writing was combined with marketing writing to ensure a single, consistent voice across all customer touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

## Ambitious Goal Setting and Pacing

Chesky advocates for setting "ambitious goals" by employing the "add a zero" principle, encouraging teams to think 10x bigger or better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This approach forces a different way of thinking about problems, often leading to "first principle thinking" to break down and reconstruct issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

He emphasizes that a founder leader's role is to "set the pace" for the team, driven by decisive, fast decisions and a "bias of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. This means resolving issues immediately rather than postponing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

Furthermore, Chesky believes a leader's job is to "see potential in people that they never saw in themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>. Pushing a team should foster a "growth mindset" rather than demoralization, as it conveys belief in their greater capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Balance

Despite his intense involvement, Chesky paradoxically found that being "in the details" ultimately led to more time on his hands once the company "turned the corner." This is because clarity and shared direction reduced conflicts, turnover, and the need for reactive interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.

Recognizing the importance of avoiding burnout, Chesky prioritizes:
*   **Time Off:** Taking full weekends off every other week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.
*   **Physical Health:** Consistent exercise (daily cardio, gym 3-4 times a week) and a healthy diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.
*   **Relationships:** Nurturing "healthy relationships" with friends and family, which he identifies as the secret to happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. He consciously manages his time to maintain these connections and create new shared experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.
*   **Proactive Prioritization:** He advises founders to avoid being reactive and instead proactively schedule their time based on strategic priorities, discerning between "fake work" and meaningful tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>.

Chesky maintains a "beginner's mindset," constantly seeking to learn and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. He cultivates curiosity, studies the history of organizational structures, and is "shameless about reaching out for help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. He believes that to evolve as a leader, one must constantly be "becoming" and be open to changing previous beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. This aligns with [[Leadership and personal growth as a CEO | leadership and personal growth as a CEO]].

His background as an artist and industrial designer instilled in him an appreciation for intuition, imagination, and holistic design, believing that companies need to be "whole" and "well-rounded" in their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>.

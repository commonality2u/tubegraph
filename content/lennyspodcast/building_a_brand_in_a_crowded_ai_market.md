In an increasingly crowded market filled with [[new_applications_of_ai_in_startups | AI companies]], products, and content, distinguishing and differentiating a brand is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The core challenge for [[future_of_startups_with_ai_tools | AI companies]] is that AI will soon cease to be a unique feature, much like electricity is no longer considered a feature for products that run on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## What is a Brand?
A brand is not merely a logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. It represents a promise to the userâ€”what they can expect from the company and what they would miss if it were gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. For example, Nike has a brand, while Hyatt has a logo; if Nike opened a hotel, consumers would have an idea of what it would be like, but not so if Hyatt made sneakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. To build a brand, a company must stand for something and clearly define what it *doesn't* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### The Importance of Making and Keeping a Promise
The fundamental question [[future_of_startups_with_ai_tools | AI companies]] and all companies need to ask is: "What's in this for the user?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. The goal is to make a difficult, remarkable promise and then consistently keep it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Breaking a promise, even once, can damage a brand's value and consumer trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

For instance, airlines often lack true brands because customer loyalty is primarily driven by points (bribery) rather than a willingness to pay extra for the service itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. A strong brand means consumers would pay extra to stick with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## Empathy and User-Centricity
A core aspect of [[leveraging_ai_in_product_development | product development]] and brand building is empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This isn't just about kindness, but about understanding the user deeply, recognizing that a product is made *for* them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. If users make a "mistake" with a product, it's typically the product's fault, not the user's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The standard for quality should be delighting the person buying the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## The Power of the Network Effect and Word-of-Mouth
For software, especially Software as a Service, building a network effect into the product is almost essential for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
A key question for a product is: "Will this work better for my users if they tell other people about it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. If the answer is no, then there's no reason for them to tell others, and marketing becomes a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. If the answer is yes, the marketing problem is largely solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

### Being "Remarkable" (Purple Cow)
The concept of the "Purple Cow" emphasizes the importance of being "remarkable," meaning "worth making a remark about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. It's not about creating a viral gimmick, but about designing a product that genuinely improves a person's life in a way that makes them want to talk about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. When a company knows in advance what it wants its users to say, they are more likely to say it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

A historical example is Google's search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Unlike Yahoo, which had many links on its homepage, Google's simple interface with two buttons made a clear promise: "We are smart enough to take you where you want to go without you spending a lot of time browsing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. This utility made it remarkable, leading users to recommend it to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

## Tension in Strategy
A great strategy inherently has "tension" at its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. This isn't stress, but rather the space created when a new product makes a promise ("this thing can do X"), and the user imagines what their life might be like if that promise were true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. If users fall in love with this possibility, tension arises: "Did you tell the truth? Is it going to work for them?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. This tension drives engagement and anticipation.

## Case Study: Claude vs. ChatGPT Brand Perception
When discussing [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_building_ai_products | AI products]], the difference in brand perception between Claude and ChatGPT highlights these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Seth Godin has an emotional connection to Claude because it feels like it has a brand, offering kindness and humility even when it doesn't know an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. In contrast, ChatGPT's reputation is viewed as less positive because it "regularly overpromises and underdelivers... without kindness or humility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. This leads to a willingness to pay extra for Claude, as it has built a stronger brand through its consistent delivery and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

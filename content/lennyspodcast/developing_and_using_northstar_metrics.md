Developing and effectively using a Northstar metric is crucial for guiding a business's growth. It helps a company understand if it's delivering value and provides a clear target for cross-functional teams.

## What is a Northstar Metric?
A Northstar metric is a single metric that "essentially captures units of that value being delivered" to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>. It reflects how many people are experiencing the product's core value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>, which is tied to the concept of [[developing_differentiated_value | must-have product-market fit]].

## Importance of a Northstar Metric
A Northstar metric provides a critical focus for the team, as "what gets measured gets managed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>. It aligns everyone's incentives toward a shared goal, helping to overcome challenges in cross-functional collaboration between marketing, product, sales, and customer success teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. This focus ensures that efforts are directed towards delivering core value, rather than just superficial growth hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.

## Developing a Northstar Metric
The process of defining a Northstar metric starts with understanding the "must-have value" uncovered by the [[Shaun Ellis Test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.

Key steps and considerations include:
*   **Team Decision** The team needs to collectively decide on the Northstar metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
*   **Reflecting Value** The metric should reflect how many people are "experiencing that product-market fit experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **Up and to the Right** It should be a metric that can continuously trend upwards over time, allowing for ongoing management and positive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>.
*   **Not a Ratio** Avoid ratios, as they can sometimes hide underlying issues or make it harder to consistently show upward progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>.
*   **Correlation to Revenue, Not Revenue Itself** The Northstar metric should correlate to revenue growth but should not be revenue itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. Revenue should be a "byproduct of doing things right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. The focus should be on "units of value from the customer perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:58">[01:21:58]</a>.
*   **Time-Capped** Including a time component (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) is crucial for driving behavior and providing a quantifiable way to track engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>. It helps ensure the metric is actionable and focused on recent activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.
*   **Actionable** The metric should be tied to a "good enough taste of this product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>. If the activation moment is too far down the user experience (e.g., "used it a hundred times"), it becomes less actionable for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

## Examples of Northstar Metrics
*   **Amazon:** Monthly purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:25">[01:21:25]</a>. This reflects the value of helping customers find and acquire what they need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>.
*   **Airbnb:** Nights booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>. This directly reflects the core value delivered to users.
*   **Uber:** Weekly rides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:59">[01:22:59]</a>. The time component emphasizes frequent engagement.
*   **Facebook:** Famously shifted from Monthly Active Users (MAU) to Daily Active Users (DAU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. This change in metric significantly incentivized the team to design experiences that encouraged daily use, making the product "way more addictive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.
*   **Dropbox (Hypothetical):** Files accessed (rather than just files hosted) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. This would emphasize active use and value extraction.
*   **Eventbrite (Hypothetical):** Weekly tickets sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15">[01:24:15]</a>. This would focus on the actual success for event organizers.

## Evolving and Optimizing Growth with Northstar Metrics
Once a Northstar metric is identified, the next step is to "diagramming what are what are all of the different ways that we can grow that that Northstar metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. This leads to building a "value delivery engine" or growth model that includes onboarding, activation, engagement loops, referrals, and revenue models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.

The process of optimizing the Northstar metric involves:
1.  **Prioritizing Activation:** Focus initially on activation because new users are at the highest risk of being lost before experiencing the product's core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.
2.  **Iterative Improvement:** Continuously run experiments against identified opportunities for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>. This includes qualitative research to understand user behavior and identify bottlenecks, and then A/B testing to measure the impact of changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.
3.  **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** As [[measuring_developer_productivity | growth strategies become more complex]], success requires effective collaboration across product, marketing, engineering, and other teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. This collaborative approach leads to better experiments and more impactful changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>.
4.  **AI's Role:** Artificial intelligence is expected to enhance the ability to model potential outcomes of experiments and streamline the analysis of results, which is often a bottleneck in high-velocity testing programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>. It can also help identify opportunities for improvement and provide dispassionate recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:08">[01:32:08]</a>.

The goal is to continuously optimize the entire growth funnel, ensuring that customer acquisition is efficient, and new users are effectively converted, retained, and monetized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.

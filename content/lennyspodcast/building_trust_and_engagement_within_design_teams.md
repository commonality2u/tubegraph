Building and maintaining trust and engagement within design teams is crucial for their success and overall company performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe, shares insights from her experiences leading design teams at hypergrowth companies like Airbnb, Lyft, and Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.

## The Importance of Trust in Leadership

A pivotal learning experience for Katie Dill early in her leadership career at Airbnb highlighted the critical role of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Hired to lead the 10-person product design team that previously reported directly to a founder, Dill came in ready to implement changes based on observations of low engagement scores and collaboration issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

About a month into her role, half the design team, accompanied by an HR partner, staged an "intervention" to list everything they felt she was doing wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Despite the initial difficulty, Dill realized the core issue was a lack of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The team didn't trust her intentions or that she cared about them and their shared goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

This experience led to an immediate shift in her approach:
*   **Prioritize Listening** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>: Instead of "coming in swinging," listening to what individuals and the team cared about and what motivated them was essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Bring the Team Along** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>: While moving the organization in the necessary direction, it was crucial to involve and align the team in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Trust as a Key Element** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>: For changes to be inflicted *with* people rather than *on* them, trust is the fundamental element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

Within a couple of months, the design team achieved the best engagement scores in the company, demonstrating the positive impact of this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Maximizing Team Performance: The Formula

A clarifying formula for team leadership is: **Performance = Potential - Interference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.
Leaders aim for better performance, leading to greater purpose, motivation, and the creation of superior products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>.

### Increasing Potential
*   **Hiring Well** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>: Identify candidates with strong judgment, great taste, humility, and "chutzpah" or hustle to fight for quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. It's easier to teach tools and processes than taste and character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.
*   **Talent Development** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>: Continuously develop talent and help individuals grow to increase their capability to do better work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.

### Decreasing Interference
Interferences act as a "lead weight" on talent, leading to burnout and decreased performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. Removing these obstacles is key to unlocking a team's potential.

#### Fostering Clarity and Alignment
*   **Vision and Alignment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>: Even with talented individuals, shared vision and alignment are crucial to ensure individual contributions coalesce into a cohesive, high-quality product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.
*   **Cross-Functional Collaboration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>: Designers, engineers, and product managers should work closely, ideally sitting together, to foster shared goals and enable easy, informal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. This multi-disciplinary approach provides necessary checks and balances and diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
*   **"Two T-Shirts" Approach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>: Teams should foster both a strong design community (design t-shirt) and strong cross-disciplinary team identity (e.g., Marketplace t-shirt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>. Design teams should regularly convene to build community and ensure alignment on the overall experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>.
*   **Visual Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>: Regular sharing of design work in progress (screenshots or prototypes in a shared deck) enhances awareness across the design team and other functions like product and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>. This helps identify overlaps, redundancies, and misalignments early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. Keeping it low-maintenance (like Google Slides) ensures accessibility for all functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>.

#### Operationalizing Quality
Quality is a group effort, not the sole responsibility of one team or individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.
*   **Walk the Store** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>: Implement a process where engineering, product, and design leaders regularly review key user journeys from the user's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. They "friction log" their experiences, noting what works and what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>. This process fosters empathy and provides insights into areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   **Product Quality Review (PQR)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>: Quarterly calibration meetings where leaders score journeys based on a rubric (e.g., usability, utility, desirability) and discuss their findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. This ensures a shared understanding of the quality bar across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.
*   **Courage to Edit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>: Leaders must have the courage to say "this isn't good enough" and push for further iteration, even when a team has put significant effort into a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. This helps maintain a high standard for output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **Performance Evaluation Alignment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>: Define "impact" in performance rubrics to include long-term quality efforts and broader contributions, not just immediate metric movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. At Stripe, "meticulous craft" is an explicit operating principle expected of everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

#### Challenging Incrementalism
There can be a fear of bold ideas in companies, leading to a preference for incremental approaches that are easier to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. This can prevent making the product better as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>.
*   **"Reach for the Stars, Land on the Moon"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>: Engage in vision work that sketches out the ideal version of the experience, comprehensive across the entire user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>. This "North Star" guides iterative development towards a desired outcome, rather than stumbling upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

By implementing these strategies, leaders can foster environments where teams are not only highly productive but also deeply engaged and committed to delivering exceptional experiences, echoing the importance of [[building_and_maintaining_company_culture_to_enhance_team_collaboration | building and maintaining company culture to enhance team collaboration]] and [[key_strategies_and_practices_for_effective_product_management_and_team_building | key strategies and practices for effective product management and team building]].

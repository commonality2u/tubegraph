Developing one's [[building_and_leveraging_personal_power | power]] in life and business is crucial for [[leadership_and_career_advancement | career advancement]], leading to positive outcomes like promotions, increased salary, and reduced stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This perspective highlights that the world operates based on these dynamics, and understanding them is essential for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of [[organizational_dynamics_in_strategy_execution | organizational behavior]] at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, teaches a popular course titled "The Paths to Power" and authored "The Seven Rules of Power," which outlines actionable steps to build influence and achieve goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>.

## Why Power Makes People Uncomfortable

Discomfort with the concept of power often stems from a perception that it is "dirty" or "evil," leading individuals to shy away from necessary actions for career success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This discomfort arises because the realities of acquiring power often conflict with traditional moral teachings or aspirations for how the world *should* operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. However, just as a hammer or knife can be used for good (e.g., building, surgery) or ill (e.g., hitting, robbery), power itself is a tool, and its impact depends on its user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. More good people need to acquire power for it to be used for positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.

Pfeffer's course encourages students to be less judgmental and to understand that the class is not for everyone, particularly those unwilling to be open to its material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Suspending judgment, especially for those on your "critical path" in an interdependent job, is vital for building positive working relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Successful executives often master the skill of not revealing their true opinions of others, which is crucial for maintaining collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## The Seven Rules of Power

The seven rules provide a [[frameworks_for_clarity_and_influence | framework]] for cultivating power:

1.  **Get Out of Your Own Way** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>
2.  **Break The Rules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>
3.  **Show Up in a Powerful Fashion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>
4.  **Create a Powerful Brand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>
5.  **Network Relentlessly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>
6.  **Use Your Power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>
7.  **Success Excuses Almost Everything** (or, what you did to get there will be forgiven or forgotten) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>

### 1. Get Out of Your Own Way

This principle addresses psychological barriers to acquiring power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. If one views power as "dirty" or experiences imposter syndrome (believing they don't deserve their position), they are less likely to take actions necessary for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. This includes avoiding preemptory apologies or disempowering self-descriptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. The core idea is to prioritize competence and respect over being liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. If you want to be liked, get a dog; in professional settings, the focus should be on performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

### 2. Break The Rules

Breaking rules makes one stand out and become memorable, which is crucial for [[leadership_and_career_advancement | career advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. Rules are often established by those who benefit from the existing system, so disrupting them can be a [[sources_of_strategic_power_and_competitive_advantage | source of strategic power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. This aligns with the concept of being a "disruptor" in business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. An example of breaking rules is asking for help, which many perceive as a weakness but can actually be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. Asking is essential because if you don't ask, you won't get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

### 3. Show Up in a Powerful Fashion

Appearance and demeanor significantly impact how others perceive one's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.# Influence and Power Dynamics in Organizations

5.  **Network Relentlessly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>
6.  **Use Your Power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>
7.  **Success Excuses Almost Everything** (or, what you did to get there will be forgiven or forgotten) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>

### 1. Get Out of Your Own Way

This principle addresses psychological barriers to acquiring power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. If one views power as "dirty" or experiences imposter syndrome (believing they don't deserve their position), they are less likely to take actions necessary for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. This includes avoiding preemptory apologies or disempowering self-descriptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. The core idea is to prioritize competence and respect over being liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. If you want to be liked, get a dog; in professional settings, the focus should be on performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

### 2. Break The Rules

Breaking rules makes one stand out and become memorable, which is crucial for [[leadership_and_career_advancement | career advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. Rules are often established by those who benefit from the existing system, so disrupting them can be a [[sources_of_strategic_power_and_competitive_advantage | source of strategic power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. This aligns with the concept of being a "disruptor" in business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. An example of breaking rules is asking for help, which many perceive as a weakness but can actually be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. Asking is essential because if you don't ask, you won't get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

### 3. Show Up in a Powerful Fashion

Appearance and demeanor significantly impact how others perceive one's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. People respond to visual cues and vocal tone more than the content of what is said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. Behaviors that convey power include:
*   Not reading from notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>
*   Maintaining eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>
*   Being brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>
*   Using more gestures and open body posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>
*   Speaking with a louder voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>
*   Invading personal space gently (e.g., light touch on arm/shoulder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>
*   Not apologizing for speaking or taking time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>
*   Using anger as a signal of power (as it is outside the norm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>
*   More speaking time and longer gazing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>
*   Disinhibited laughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>

These are skills that can be learned and mastered, similar to acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.

### 4. Create a Powerful Brand

In hierarchical [[organizational_dynamics_in_strategy_execution | organizations]], where there are fewer positions at the top, differentiating oneself is critical for [[leadership_and_career_advancement | career advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. To be promoted, one must be known, not just for their skills, but for their unique value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Building a personal brand involves actively doing things that make others recognize and remember you, even if it feels like self-promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This can include writing, starting a podcast, contributing to books, hosting networking dinners, or even cultivating a distinctive personal style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. While substance is crucial, visibility ensures that substance is recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. Reframing "self-promotion" as amplifying team impact or scaling oneself by sharing knowledge can make it more palatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

### 5. Network Relentlessly

Networking is a powerful way to gain knowledge and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. The first principle of networking is generosity—focusing on how to be helpful to others, such as making useful introductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. The broader one's social network, the more access they have to diverse people and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. Networking is essential for leadership and management, which involve "getting things done through other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.

One strategy is to pursue "weak ties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. While strong ties (family, close friends, immediate colleagues) offer support, weak ties—people more distant or different from you—are more likely to provide non-redundant information and new connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. Becoming a "broker" by connecting people with beneficial relationships, like venture capitalists connecting ideas to money or real estate agents connecting buyers and sellers, increases one's centrality and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

### 6. Use Your Power

Exercising power leads to more power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>. When individuals in positions of authority mobilize resources and achieve results, they are typically given more resources and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>. Success attracts association; the more successful one becomes, the more people want to work with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>. Simply demonstrating power can also increase it, as people are often drawn to and will follow the lead of those perceived as powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

### 7. Success Excuses Almost Everything

This rule acknowledges that once power is acquired, the means by which it was obtained are often "forgiven or forgotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. Life is not homeostatic; it is self-fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. If others believe someone is powerful, that person tends to become more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. People are often attracted to money, power, and success, and they will overlook flaws to be associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. This pragmatic view suggests focusing on what *is*, rather than what *should be* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>.

## The Knowing-Doing Gap and Practical Application

Pfeffer emphasizes that learning about power is insufficient; one must "do power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. The "Knowing-Doing Gap" refers to the disconnect between understanding principles and putting them into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. To ensure learning sticks, students in Pfeffer's class are given practical assignments, such as:
*   Setting clear career goals and defining what success looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.
*   Assessing their strengths and weaknesses in the "seven attributes of power" and developing a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.
*   Creating resources to gain leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.
*   Practicing "acting with power" through video exercises and receiving feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.
*   Writing a personal brand statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.

The approach involves starting with small, uncomfortable steps and gradually pushing beyond one's comfort zone, akin to the 15% rule where one pushes just beyond their current capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>. For those feeling uncomfortable, seeking coaching or forming a "personal board of directors" for advice, social support, and accountability is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.

## The Price of Power

While power offers many benefits, it comes with a significant trade-off: reduced autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. People in powerful positions, like a university dean or a CEO, often have their schedules and lives dictated by their roles, with little control over their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. Increased power also brings enormous visibility and scrutiny, leading to a loss of privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. Furthermore, powerful individuals may face the "trust dilemma," questioning whether people associate with them for who they are or for their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>. The pursuit of power can also extract a heavy toll on personal life and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.

Ultimately, understanding [[influence_and_power_dynamics_in_organizations | influence and power dynamics in organizations]] is not about becoming a specific type of person, but about acquiring skills to be more effective and successful in the world as it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

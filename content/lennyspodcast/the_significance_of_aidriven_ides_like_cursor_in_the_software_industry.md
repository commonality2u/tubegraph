[[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]], developed by Any Sphere, stands out as a leading AI code editor at the forefront of transforming software development. Michael Tru, co-founder and CEO of Any Sphere, describes [[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]] as an invention of "a new type of programming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, aiming for a world "after code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## A Vision Beyond Code

Michael Tru envisions a future where being an engineer feels more like being a "logic designer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This future involves specifying intent for how software should work, moving away from explicit code writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The goal is to distill software creation down to concisely describing intent to the computer, focusing on how software should work and look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

This vision contrasts with two common perspectives:
*   Continuing with traditional text editing in formal languages like TypeScript or Go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   A chatbot-style interaction where users simply type requests to a bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

[[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]]'s approach avoids the imprecision of chatbots, which lack the fine control needed for complex software, and rejects the notion that software development will remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Instead, the future of [[The future of software development beyond traditional coding | software development]] will feature a high-level, human-readable representation of software logic, akin to an evolution of programming language towards pseudocode, that is easier to navigate and edit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Evolving Skills in an [[Impact of AI on software development | AI-Driven]] World

In this "after code" world, certain skills will become increasingly valuable:
*   **Taste** Having the right idea for what should be built and how it should function and appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This extends beyond visual design to the logic of how software works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:17">[0:09:17]</a>.
*   **Logic Design** Engineers will focus on specifying their intent, defining "the what" rather than "the how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Reduced Carefulnes** AI will allow engineers to be "less careful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:27">[0:10:27]</a>, shifting focus from meticulous detail to high-level design and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

While "vibe coding" (generating code without fully understanding details) exists, the challenge for [[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]] is to maintain human control over software details even when the underlying code isn't fully comprehended by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## Origin and Rapid Growth of [[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]]

[[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]]'s inception was driven by a solution in search of a problem, stemming from reflections on how [[AIs impact on software development | AI]] would improve over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
Two key moments inspired its creation:
1.  **Git Co-pilot** The first beta of Git Co-pilot proved to be a genuinely useful [[AI in Product Development | AI product]] and one of the most useful dev tools experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
2.  **OpenAI Scaling Papers** Papers from OpenAI demonstrated that [[AI]] would continuously improve through model and data scaling alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

Initially, Any Sphere tried to automate mechanical engineering, assuming the coding space would be uncompetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. However, they realized the challenges (lack of domain expertise, insufficient data for custom models) and, observing a perceived lack of ambition among existing players in programming [[AI]], pivoted to building [[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

The decision to build a full IDE (Integrated Development Environment) rather than a plugin or a standalone model was based on the belief that programming will fundamentally change, requiring complete control over the application's UI and form factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. [[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]]'s philosophy prioritizes human control and rapid iteration, ensuring the AI assists rather than fully automates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

The development of [[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]] was characterized by:
*   **Dogfooding** The team intensely used the tool daily, ensuring it was useful to them before shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
*   **Rapid Prototyping** The first hand-rolled prototype was built and launched within three months of the first line of code, embracing a "build in public" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   **User Feedback** Initial user feedback led to [[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]] switching to a VS Code base, highlighting agility and responsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

[[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]] achieved historic growth, reaching $100 million ARR in just 20 months and $300 million ARR within two years of launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This success is attributed to a "sustained paranoia" about continuous improvement and focusing intensely on making the product consistently better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. The growth has been a consistent exponential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.

## The Counterintuitive Role of Custom Models

Despite initial intentions, [[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]] significantly invests in its own model development, with every "magic moment" in the product involving a custom model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>. While large generative models (like GPT, Gemini) are used for general tasks, custom models are crucial for:
*   **Speed and Cost** Foundation models can be too slow or expensive for real-time features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. For instance, [[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]]'s "souped-up autocomplete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a> predicts developer actions across multiple files within 300 milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>, a task where custom models trained on code diffs excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.
*   **Specialty Use Cases** Custom models handle niche tasks that foundation models are not optimized for, such as searching codebases for relevant parts to feed to larger models or filling in code details based on high-level suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.
This "ensemble of models" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>, combining the strengths of various models, including open-source and proprietary ones, is a key to [[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]]'s product quality and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

## Defensibility and Market Dynamics

In the [[AIdriven software development | AI-driven software development]] space, defensibility isn't built on traditional lock-in but on continuous innovation and being the best product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. The market has an incredibly high ceiling, meaning there's always more useful functionality to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. This dynamic resembles historical markets like search engines or personal computers, where continuous leaps forward were possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.

The market for [[AI-driven software development | AI-driven software development]] tools is seen as far larger than past IDE markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. While there will be many solutions, Michael Tru predicts a single "general tool" will emerge as the primary means to build almost all the world's software, becoming a "generationally big business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.

Microsoft's Co-pilot, while an inspiration, is seen as struggling due to structural issues like a market unfriendly to incumbents (easy to switch tools) and historical reasons, such as talent attrition from the initial Co-pilot team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

## Tips for Using AI-Driven IDEs

To maximize success with [[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]] (and similar tools), users should:
1.  **Develop "Taste"**: Understand the models' capabilities, what tasks they can handle, and how much explicit specification they require <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.
2.  **Chop Up Tasks**: Instead of giving the model a single large task, break it into smaller, incremental steps. This allows for iterative refinement and better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.
3.  **Experiment Safely**: Users, especially experienced developers, are encouraged to "explicitly try to fall on their face" in safe environments (like side projects) to discover the limits of what these models can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>.

## [[AIs impact on product development and skills | Impact on Engineers]] and Hiring

[[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]] benefits both junior and senior engineers, though they fall into different "anti-patterns": junior engineers tend to over-rely on [[AI]], while senior engineers often under-estimate its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

Despite [[AI]]'s advancements, engineers remain critically needed. The demand for software is vast and "very lasting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>, far outstripping current building capacity due to the high cost and labor intensity of traditional development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. [[AI]] will enable engineers to do "much more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

On hiring, [[Cursor and its impact on programming | Cursor]] initially hired too slowly, realizing the importance of patience and focusing on world-class talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>. Key hiring lessons include:
*   Prioritizing intellectual curiosity, experimentation, honesty, and "micro-pessimism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.
*   Considering experienced candidates ("later careered") beyond the typical "well-known school, very young" archetype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.
*   Utilizing a two-day, on-site "work test" project in their codebase as a formative interview process. This helps assess real-world skills and team fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.

## Staying Focused and Future Outlook

In the rapidly evolving [[Impact of AI on software development | AI]] space, staying focused is crucial. This is achieved through:
*   **Hiring Disposition**: Bringing in individuals who are less focused on external validation and more on building quality work, remaining "levelheaded" amidst hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Building an Immune System**: The team has witnessed many technologies come and go since 2021, developing an "immune system" to discern which events truly matter for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.

The broader misunderstanding of [[AI]]'s future lies in extreme views: either it will happen "very fast" or it's "bluster and hype" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>. Michael Tru believes it's a "multi-decade thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a> that will be more consequential than the internet or the advent of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. The key will be companies that build both the underlying technology and the product experience for specific areas of knowledge work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.

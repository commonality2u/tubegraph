Claire Butler, Figma's tenth employee and first marketing hire, discusses how Figma scaled its operations and culture while prioritizing user trust and maintaining its bottom-up growth motion. She highlights the importance of [[leadership_and_company_culture | leadership]], authenticity, and a deep understanding of user needs in this process.

## Early Days at Figma: Foundation of Culture

Figma's early days were characterized by a fluid environment where strategic decisions and hands-on "grunt work" coexisted. Claire describes an oscillation between high-level discussions, such as convincing the team to rename their product "Summit" to "Figma" on her first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, and practical tasks like carrying ice for a company meetup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This blend fostered a culture of ownership and agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

A key aspect of the early culture was the **trust in intuition and gut feelings**, especially during stressful periods like the stealth launch. With no one else to consult, Claire and Dylan Field, Figma's CEO, had to rely on their instincts, a practice Dylan excelled at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This foundation of trust in their vision and in each other was critical for navigating uncertainty.

### Choosing to Join Figma

Claire chose to join Figma due to three main factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>:
*   **Logical Product Sense:** The idea of an online, collaborative design tool immediately made sense, given the inefficiencies of traditional design workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Social Proof:** Trusted investors and mentors, including Danny Rimer from Index Ventures and John Lilly, believed in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Dylan Field's Persuasiveness:** Dylan's ability to logically address and dismantle concerns about the product and company was a major draw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### The Decision to Launch from Stealth

Figma was in stealth for three to four years, starting in 2012 and launching in late 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>, to avoid demotivation from building in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. A major challenge was the initial lack of a core "multiplayer" feature, which was their key differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Despite this, they decided to launch to gain momentum and user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. The confidence to launch came from observing designers' enthusiastic reactions during demos, literally pulling the laptop from Dylan's hands to play with the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. This "pull" was a stronger indicator of product-market fit than early metrics, which were often too small to be meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

## Figma's Bottom-Up Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy

Figma's unique bottom-up GTM motion is centered around two main steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>:
1.  **Get individual contributors (ICs) to love the product.**
2.  **Enable them to spread the product within their organizations.**

This strategy contrasts with traditional top-down SaaS models that target executive buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Figma's efficiency allowed them to operate without a sales team for the first three years, relying on self-served revenue from users putting Figma on their credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Even now, most marketing-qualified leads for sales come from free or Pro tier users who are already champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

### Step 1: Getting Individual Contributors to Love Figma

[[creating_and_maintaining_team_culture_and_passion | Creating and maintaining team culture and passion]] around the product is vital to user love. Figma focused on four key areas:

1.  **Building Credibility and Authenticity:**
    *   Designers are wary of traditional marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. Figma focused on authenticity by having engineers and designers create deep technical content that explained how the tool worked and the rationale behind product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
    *   A "designer advocate" was the first marketing-related hire, bridging the gap between users and the product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. This role, which has scaled significantly, ensures that communication and product development remain grounded in user needs and technical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.

2.  **Building with Users:**
    *   Figma prioritized listening to user feedback from day one. The famous "Koda story" exemplifies this: when their first user, Jeremy from Koda, couldn't open a file on his engineer Philip's MacBook, Dylan Field declared, "Everybody drop everything, we have to fix this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Evan Wallace, Figma's CTO, was driven to Palo Alto to fix the MacBook directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    *   Engineers and team members actively participated in customer support via Intercom, often debugging issues live with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. This direct interaction made users feel invested in Figma's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

3.  **Finding a Channel for Relationship Building:**
    *   Figma focused its early efforts on Twitter, recognizing that the design community already congregated there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.
    *   Dylan built a "scraper" tool to identify influential designers and their networks, allowing Figma to connect directly with key community members for feedback rather than waiting for users to come to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.
    *   Figma team members, including Dylan and Sho Kuwamoto (CTO), actively engaged with users on Twitter, putting a personal face to the brand and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

4.  **Transparency and Authenticity:**
    *   Figma committed to being transparent and honest, even at scale. This included conducting public postmortems for downtimes, taking full accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>.
    *   A critical test of this value was the Adobe acquisition announcement. Instead of hiding behind the brand, Figma's team, including Dylan and Sho, held a public Twitter Spaces session to answer user questions directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>. This demonstrated a deep commitment to its community, even in high-stakes situations. This reflects [[building_trust_and_driving_impact_in_product_management | building trust and driving impact in product management]].

### Step 2: Helping Figma Spread within Organizations

Once individual contributors loved the product, the next step was to enable its spread, which involved:

1.  **Making it Easy to Try and Share without Gates:**
    *   Figma offers a very robust free tier, allowing users to build confidence in the tool over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>.
    *   A crucial packaging change involved allowing unlimited collaborators on free teams (though with limited files) instead of limiting collaboration, which had been a blocker to virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>. This change significantly increased adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.
    *   The pricing model also strategically separates editors (paid) from viewers (free), making it easier for product managers and other non-designers to engage with files, thus spreading the tool more widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>.

2.  **Leveraging Designer Advocates in the Sales Process:**
    *   When Figma eventually hired its first salesperson, it was on the same day as a new designer advocate, Tom Lowry, who had championed Figma at his previous company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>.
    *   These advocates, who are technical experts and passionate users without sales quotas, joined sales calls to explain the product and offer best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>. This "Tom Factor" significantly increased deal close rates because designers preferred to hear from fellow designers who understood their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>.
    *   This highlights the importance of [[role_of_company_culture_in_product_management | company culture]] and expertise in sales.

3.  **Targeting Design Systems as an Operational Driver for Adoption:**
    *   Design Systems, which help standardize design components across an organization, were initially a blocker for Figma's adoption in large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>.
    *   Figma turned this challenge into an advantage by heavily investing in features and content around Design Systems, even hosting informal meetups to learn from practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.
    *   This focus made Design Systems a key reason for organizations to upgrade from Pro to Enterprise tiers, as Figma offered advanced solutions for large-scale consistency and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>.

4.  **Maintaining and Growing Connection with Internal Champions:**
    *   The relationship with internal champions must be maintained indefinitely, even when they express dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>.
    *   Figma actively supports these champions' careers by offering platforms like speaking engagements at events (e.g., Config, Schema) and social media amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>. This symbiotic relationship strengthens both the individual's profile and Figma's credibility.

## Scaling the Culture and Maintaining Trust

[[building_a_strong_company_culture_in_a_fastgrowing_company | Building a strong company culture in a fastgrowing company]] requires continuous effort. At scale, Figma still adheres to its core principles, but the tactics evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>:

*   **Scaling Advocates:** The designer advocate role has expanded to full teams, including developer advocates and FigJam advocates, and is regionalized to support new markets like Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. These advocates are often passionate users who emerge from the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.
*   **"Little Big Updates":** To address the tension between building new features and fixing bugs, Figma introduced "Little Big Updates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. Engineers dedicate "quality weeks" to fix small but annoying issues requested by users, which are then launched together, showing users that their feedback is valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.
*   **Continued Transparency:** Even when difficult, like the Adobe acquisition, Figma's commitment to openness (e.g., public forums, CEO participation) reinforces trust with its large user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. This is an example of [[balancing_startup_and_large_company_operations | balancing startup and large company operations]].
*   **Community Events:** Conferences like Config became massive platforms for showcasing technical content, facilitating learning, and amplifying user voices, reinforcing Figma's presence within the design community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.

### Prerequisites for This Approach

While Figma's approach has been highly successful, Claire notes that it's particularly effective for products with certain characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>:

*   **Technical Audience:** Users who are technical, care deeply about their tools, and derive significant value from the product individually, even before collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.
*   **Existing Community:** A pre-existing community around the target audience (e.g., designers on Twitter) provides a ready-made distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Role:** An IC audience whose role naturally involves high collaboration, enabling them to be "super spreaders" of the product within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>.

### Leadership and Team Structure

The most crucial element for this growth model is a leader who deeply believes in it and can cultivate a culture around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:58">[01:22:58]</a>. Dylan Field's core belief in this approach and his willingness to prioritize "signal over metrics" in early stages allowed Figma to invest in initiatives that didn't immediately show quantifiable ROI but built long-term user love and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>. This reflects [[leadership_and_company_culture | leadership and company culture]].

> "You can't optimize your way to product-market fit." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>

Claire emphasizes the importance of **consistent pressure over time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>, valuing sustained effort and incremental progress over immediate accomplishments, a motto that guided both her career and Figma's growth.

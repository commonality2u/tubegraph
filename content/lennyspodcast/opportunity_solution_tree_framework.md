The [[opportunity_solution_tree_framework | Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) framework]] is a simple yet powerful visual tool designed to help product teams move from an output-focused mindset to an outcome-focused one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35">[07:35]</a>. It provides a structured approach for navigating the complex problem of determining what to build when starting with a desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46">[07:46]</a>.

## Structure of the Tree

The [[opportunity_solution_tree_framework | Opportunity Solution Tree]] is structured like a decision tree:
*   **Outcome (Root)**: The tree begins with a desired outcome at its root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25">[07:25]</a>.
*   **Opportunities**: This branches into opportunities within the "opportunity space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28">[07:28]</a>.
*   **Solutions**: These opportunities then branch into potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30">[07:30]</a>.
*   **Assumption Tests**: From solutions, there can be branches for assumption tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30">[07:30]</a>.

The core purpose is to add structure to the often wide-open and messy problem of product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17">[08:17]</a>.

### Defining Opportunities

A key challenge is accurately defining an "opportunity." An opportunity is defined as an unmet need, pain point, or desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31">[08:31]</a>. A common mistake is framing opportunities as solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38">[08:38]</a>. The heart of good product development lies in getting comfortable in the problem or opportunity space, taking the time to frame the problem, and understanding what is truly needed before jumping to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49">[08:49]</a>.

Opportunities should be specific. For example, instead of "I wish this was easier to use," a specific opportunity in streaming might be "It's hard to enter my password/select specific letters on screen with the Apple TV remote" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26">[16:26]</a>. Specific opportunities are easier to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52">[16:52]</a>.

### Structuring the Opportunity Space

Teams are recommended to structure the opportunity space using an "experience map" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51">[09:51]</a>. For instance, in streaming entertainment, the experience map might include steps like deciding to watch something, choosing what to watch, evaluating content, the viewing experience, and post-viewing engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21">[10:21]</a>. Under each step, the needs, pain points, and desires are captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07">[11:07]</a>.

As one moves vertically down the tree, opportunities become smaller and more manageable, allowing teams to address specific problems while still contributing to a larger, harder strategic goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07">[13:07]</a>. This provides a big-picture view while enabling strategic decisions on where to focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53">[13:53]</a>.

## How to Apply the Framework

The effectiveness of the [[opportunity_solution_tree_framework | Opportunity Solution Tree]] heavily relies on collecting rich customer stories:
*   **Interviewing Well**: Opportunities emerge from customer stories. Instead of direct "what do you like?" questions, ask "tell me about the last time you..." to collect context-rich stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23">[14:23]</a>. This elicits behavior-based insights rather than unreliable opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:57">[40:57]</a>.
*   **Hearing Opportunities**: The ability to distinguish opportunities (unmet needs) from solutions is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15">[16:15]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Framing**: Frame opportunities specifically rather than broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23">[16:23]</a>.
*   **Common Experience Map**: Identify common structures across seemingly unique customer stories to build the experience map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11">[17:11]</a>.
*   **Work with Multiple Solutions**: To guard against premature commitment to an obvious solution, work with and compare multiple solutions for the same opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41">[31:41]</a>.

## Integrating with [[continuous_discovery_habits | Continuous Discovery]]

The [[opportunity_solution_tree_framework | Opportunity Solution Tree]] is intrinsically linked with [[continuous_discovery_habits | continuous discovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36">[06:36]</a>. [[continuous_discovery_habits | Continuous discovery]] involves building continuous feedback loops with customers to make better decisions about what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45">[23:45]</a>.

*   **Discovery as a Bet**: Everything in a product backlog is a "bet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00">[00:00]</a>. Discovery helps make "better bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07">[00:07]</a>.
*   **Continuous, Not Phased**: Instead of thinking in phases ("first I discover, then I deliver"), product teams should always be delivering and always discovering in parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50">[00:50]</a>. Building a discovery habit leads to better bets over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57">[00:57]</a>.
*   **Addressing "No Time for Discovery"**: This objection often stems from old project-based research methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16">[24:16]</a>. [[continuous_discovery_habits | Continuous discovery]] can be done with as little as one interview a week, integrated into the team's regular cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46">[24:46]</a>.
*   **Automating Customer Recruitment**: Automating the process of recruiting customers for interviews makes [[continuous_discovery_habits | continuous discovery]] sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07">[27:07]</a>.
    *   **Opt-in in-product**: Allow customers to opt-in for an interview while using the product, similar to NPS surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52">[27:52]</a>.
    *   **Internal Teams**: For B2B or specific customer segments, leverage internal teams (sales, account managers, support) who are already in contact with customers to schedule interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:32">[28:32]</a>.
    *   **Tools**: Tools like Calendly (for scheduling) and Qualaroo, Ethnio, Intercom, Usabilla, Chameleon, Hotjar (for in-product intercepts) can facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16">[29:16]</a>.

## Challenges and Mindset Shifts

*   **Organizational Change**: Instead of forcing top-down organizational change, individual contributors can start by changing their own work habits, talking to customers, and connecting their work to business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42">[18:42]</a>. This empowers individuals and avoids waiting for permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41">[20:41]</a>.
*   **Cynicism of Small Data**: The concern about making decisions based on "too few" customer interviews is often an excuse to nitpick conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:46">[42:46]</a>. One interview is better than zero data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02">[43:02]</a>. Product teams are in the business of changing behavior, not seeking new knowledge, and can rely on small experiments because of robust feedback loops and the ability to gather large-scale data later through live production prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:26">[43:26]</a>.
*   **PM as Decider**: The idea of a PM being the sole "decider" or "CEO of the product" can hinder collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37">[32:37]</a>. Effective product development thrives on collaboration within a "trio" (product manager, designer, and software engineer) who work from a shared understanding and collectively seek better options when disagreements arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:33">[34:33]</a>. This requires unlearning old business culture habits that promote siloed work and internal politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01">[36:01]</a>.
*   **Experiments vs. User Research**: The terminology can be ambiguous. From a discovery standpoint, the core activities are qualitative interviewing (to understand opportunities) and assumption testing (to evaluate solutions by breaking down ideas into underlying assumptions and running small, focused tests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:07">[44:07]</a>.

## Growth and Evolution

In an ideal world, the fundamental process of the [[opportunity_solution_tree_framework | Opportunity Solution Tree]] and [[continuous_discovery_habits | continuous discovery]] does not change as a company grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:14">[41:14]</a>. A three-person team or a 100,000-person company can still operate with empowered teams focused on outcomes, continuous interviewing, and assumption testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31">[41:31]</a>. The primary difference in larger companies is the increased need to manage dependencies and lateral collaboration with adjacent teams to ensure a coherent product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40">[41:40]</a>.

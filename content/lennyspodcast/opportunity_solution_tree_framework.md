The Opportunity Solution Tree is a simple yet incredibly powerful visual framework used in product development to clarify strategy, identify levers for change, prioritize work, and align teams around a shared understanding of customer needs and business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. It helps product teams manage the complex problem of starting from an outcome and figuring out what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

## Structure of the Tree

The Opportunity Solution Tree is structured like a decision tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>:
*   **Root:** Starts with a desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
*   **First Branch:** Branches into the opportunity space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
*   **Second Branch:** Branches further into potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
*   **Third Branch (Optional):** Can extend to assumption tests related to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

The tree helps to add structure to the often "wide open, messy problem" of product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. As you move vertically down the tree, opportunities become smaller and more specific, allowing for actionable solutions while still contributing to a larger problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.

## Understanding "Opportunity"

An "opportunity" is defined as an unmet need, pain point, or desire of the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. A common challenge is distinguishing between an opportunity (problem space) and a solution (solution space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Effective product development requires getting comfortable in the problem space and taking the time to frame the problem before jumping to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

### Example: Netflix Streaming Entertainment

For a streaming service like Netflix, the overall outcome might be to increase engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. The opportunity space can be structured using an experience map of how people entertain themselves with streaming content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>:
1.  **Trigger:** Deciding to watch something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.
2.  **Decision:** How to decide what to watch, including platform choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
3.  **Evaluation:** Is the movie or show good, and does it look appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>?
4.  **Viewing Experience:** Ensuring a good experience once content is chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.
5.  **Post-Viewing:** Encouraging continued engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

Under each step, specific needs and pain points are captured. For instance, in "how do I decide what to watch," opportunities might include "I can't tell if this show is good or not" or "it's hard to enter my password/search" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. These are distinct from solutions because they describe the customer's reality, not a proposed product feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:39]</a>.

## Building an Opportunity Solution Tree

Building the tree effectively requires specific skills:
*   **Collecting Customer Stories:** Opportunities emerge from detailed customer stories, not just direct questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. Instead of asking "What do you like to watch on Netflix?", ask "Tell me about the last time you watched a movie" to gather context, nuance, and even unarticulated needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>. This means focusing on **behavior** (what did you actually do?) rather than thoughts or opinions (what would you do?) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37:00">[40:37:00]</a>.
*   **Distinguishing Opportunities from Solutions:** This is challenging, as most people tend to misidentify solutions as opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.
*   **Framing Opportunities Specifically:** Opportunities should be specific enough to be solvable, rather than broad statements like "I wish this was easier to use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.
*   **Structuring the Opportunity Space:** Ability to extract a common experience map structure from seemingly unique customer stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>.

## Implementing in Different Environments

Even if a company has a fixed roadmap or operates as a "feature factory" that prescribes what to build, individuals can still apply the principles of the Opportunity Solution Tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. By focusing on personal development of discovery habits, such as talking to customers informally (e.g., within personal networks for B2B, or general users for B2C) and understanding how work contributes to business outcomes, product managers can make better decisions even when prescribed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>.

## Continuous Discovery and Collaboration

The Opportunity Solution Tree integrates with the concept of continuous discovery, which involves continuously making decisions about what to build and continuously including the customer in that process through regular feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>.

When teams believe there is "no time for discovery," it often means there's no time for traditional, project-based research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>. However, continuous discovery can be sustained with as little as one customer interview per week, by automating the recruitment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>.

### Collaboration with Product Trio
Ideally, decisions related to the Opportunity Solution Tree are made collaboratively within a "product trio" consisting of the product manager, designer, and software engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:33:00">[34:33:00]</a>. This fosters a shared understanding and reduces disagreements, leading to better solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.

### Addressing Skepticism of Small Data
Skepticism about making decisions based on a few customer interviews is common, especially in larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[42:28:00]</a>. However, one interview is better than zero, and product teams are in the business of changing behavior, not just seeking new knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>. Small experiments are valid because strong feedback loops and continuous delivery allow for larger-scale data collection over time, honing judgment on risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:32:00">[43:32:00]</a>.

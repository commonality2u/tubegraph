The Opportunity Solution Tree is a simple visual framework designed to help product teams navigate the complex problem of starting from an outcome and determining what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. It provides scaffolding to shift from an output-focused to an outcome-focused approach in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The framework was developed by Teresa Torres, author of *Continuous Discovery Habits*, and is widely recommended in product management communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Structure of the Tree

The Opportunity Solution Tree is structured like a decision tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>:
1.  **Outcome (Root):** Starts with a desired outcome at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
2.  **Opportunities:** Branches into the opportunity space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. An "opportunity" is defined as an unmet need, pain point, or desire of the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
3.  **Solutions:** Further branches into potential solutions for those opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
4.  **Assumption Tests:** May even branch further into assumption tests from the solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

As one moves vertically down the tree, opportunities are intended to become smaller and more specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This allows teams to address smaller, solvable opportunities while still contributing to a larger, overarching problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

## Key Concepts and Challenges

### Distinguishing Opportunities from Solutions
A common struggle for teams is differentiating between the problem space (opportunities) and the solution space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Many individuals mistakenly define "opportunities" as solutions, which undermines the framework's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The heart of good product management involves getting comfortable in the problem space and taking time to frame the problem before jumping to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Structuring the Opportunity Space
Teresa Torres recommends structuring the opportunity space using an "experience map" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This involves mapping the overall customer experience and identifying distinct moments in time where needs, pain points, or desires arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. For example, in streaming entertainment, an experience map might include steps like deciding what to watch, the viewing experience, and post-viewing activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Example: Netflix
For a streaming service like Netflix, an outcome might be to increase user engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The opportunity space would explore the user's experience with streaming entertainment, perhaps broken down into stages:
*   Trigger: Deciding to watch something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>
*   Decision-making: How to decide what to watch and on which platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>
*   Evaluation: Determining if a movie or show is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
*   Viewing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
*   Post-viewing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>

Beneath each stage, specific needs and pain points are captured. For instance, under "how do I decide what to watch," opportunities could include: "I can't tell if this show is good," or "It's hard to find something to watch because I don't know if this show's any good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. These are distinct from solutions; whether at Netflix or Hulu, the core human needs related to entertaining oneself are similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Applying the Framework

### Gathering Opportunities through Customer Stories
Opportunities emerge from customer stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. To effectively identify opportunities, product teams need to collect rich stories during interviews, rather than just facts or direct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Asking questions like, "Tell me about the last time you watched a movie?" allows for the collection of contextual details, behaviors, unmet needs, pain points, and desires that might not be consciously articulated by the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

### Interviewing Effectively
Interviewing is a "grossly underestimated skill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Key tips for effective interviewing include:
*   **Focus on natural conversation:** The interview should feel like talking to a friend over a beer, not a formal Q&A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
*   **Elicit stories, not just facts:** Instead of asking "What do you like to watch?", ask "Tell me about the last time you watched something..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
*   **Be curious and dig deeper:** Continuously ask "What happened next?" or "Tell me about that" to explore the timeline and uncover friction points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>.
*   **Focus on past behavior:** Concentrate on what people *actually did*, not what they *would do* or *think* they do, as predictions are unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

### Framing Opportunities
Opportunities should be specific enough to be solvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. For example, instead of "I wish this was easier to use," a specific opportunity might be "It's hard to enter my password selecting specific letters on the screen with the Apple TV remote" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

## Addressing Organizational Challenges

### "No Time for Discovery" / Feature Factory Mindset
Even if a company operates as a "feature factory" or claims there's no time for discovery, individual product managers can still adopt the principles of [[continuous_discovery_habits | continuous Discovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Focus on individual habits:** Start talking to customers by leveraging personal networks or allowing in-product opt-ins for interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Understand outcomes:** Proactively understand the outcomes that matter to the business and product, then connect daily decisions to those outcomes, even if solutions are prescribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Shift perspective on "bets":** "Everything in our backlog is a bet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Discovery helps make "better bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It's not about stopping bets until full discovery is done, but "keep making bets in parallel, start doing some Discovery so that eventually those bets get better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. [[continuous_discovery_habits | Continuous Discovery]] means "you're always delivering and you're always discovering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

### Cynicism About Small Data in User Research
When faced with skepticism about making decisions based on a few customer interviews, it's important to remember:
*   **One is better than zero:** Many business decisions are made with no customer data, so even a small amount of qualitative data is an improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on behavior change:** Product teams are "in the business of changing Behavior not seeking new knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.
*   **Robust feedback loops:** Small experiments are valid because they are followed by "bigger feedback loops and more reliable data over time," especially through live production prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.
*   **Prioritize assumption testing:** Instead of large, time-consuming experiments, break down ideas into underlying assumptions, prioritize them, and run small, rapid tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. A team can run "half a dozen to a dozen assumption tests in one week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.

### PM's Role in Decision-Making
Teresa Torres advocates for a collaborative "trio" model (product manager, designer, and software engineer) where the team collectively decides on solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. In a well-functioning trio, disagreements are reduced by a shared understanding derived from joint [[continuous_discovery_habits | Discovery]] work. If disagreements arise, it's seen as an indication that a better option has not yet been found, prompting continued search for a stronger solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>. This approach encourages unlearning traditional "territory" and power dynamics in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.

The Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) is a simple, visual [[career_advice_and_frameworks | framework]] designed to help product teams navigate the complex problem of translating an desired outcome into actionable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. It provides scaffolding for teams transitioning from an output-focused approach (building features) to an outcome-focused approach (achieving specific results) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Structure of the Opportunity Solution Tree

The OST is structured like a decision tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>:
*   **Outcome**: At the root of the tree is the desired outcome the team aims to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
*   **Opportunities**: This branches into the "opportunity space," which represents unmet needs, pain points, or desires of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   **Solutions**: These branch from opportunities and represent potential ways to address the identified opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   **Assumption Tests**: Further branches can represent tests designed to validate assumptions underlying proposed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

The tree helps visualize [[product_strategy_stack | strategy]], identify levers, prioritize work, and gain buy-in across a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

## Distinguishing Opportunities from Solutions

A common challenge in using the OST is distinguishing between an opportunity (an unmet need, pain point, or desire) and a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Many teams mistakenly frame solutions as opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. Good [[product_strategy_stack | product strategy]] requires getting comfortable in the problem or opportunity space and taking time to frame problems effectively before jumping to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

### Example: Streaming Entertainment Service

Consider a streaming entertainment service like Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Increase customer engagement with Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Space Structure**: The overall customer experience can be mapped, including distinct moments in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>:
    *   Trigger to decide to watch something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>
    *   Deciding what to watch (and what platform to watch on) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>
    *   Evaluating if a movie/show is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>
    *   The viewing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>
    *   Post-viewing experience (encouraging continued watching) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>
*   **Specific Opportunities within "Deciding what to watch"**:
    *   "I have a movie title in mind and don't know how to find it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>
    *   "I was watching a show, how do I get back to it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>
    *   "I can't tell if this show is good or not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>
    *   "It's hard to enter my password/select specific letters on the screen with the Apple TV remote" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>
    *   These opportunities are framed without solutions and are similar across different streaming services (Netflix, Hulu), highlighting universal human needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

## Hierarchy of Opportunities

As one moves vertically down the tree, opportunities become smaller and more specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. This allows teams to address smaller, solvable opportunities while still contributing to a larger, more complex problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. This provides a strategic big-picture view and enables customer-focused decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Applying the Opportunity Solution Tree

Applying the OST, despite its simple appearance, can be complex in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. Key challenges include:
*   **Interviewing Well**: Opportunities emerge from rich customer stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. Most people struggle to collect stories, often asking direct, out-of-context questions that lead to unreliable answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>. Good interviewing involves asking about past behavior and specific instances rather than hypothetical future actions or opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:58:00">[40:58:00]</a>. This is a [[product_management_skill_development_framework | grossly underestimated skill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.
*   **Hearing Opportunities**: The ability to identify unmet needs, pain points, and desires from customer narratives is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>. Customers may not even be consciously aware of these needs, but they become apparent when recounting their experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.
*   **Framing Opportunities**: Opportunities should be specific enough to be solvable. Vague framing (e.g., "I wish this was easier to use") makes it difficult to address them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>.
*   **Structuring the Opportunity Space**: Grouping opportunities into a common experience map structure requires extracting common patterns across seemingly unique customer stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>.

## Applying OST in a "Feature Factory" Environment

For individual contributors in organizations that prescribe fixed roadmaps or operate as "feature factories," it's generally not advisable to force organizational change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>. Instead, focus on changing individual work habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>:
*   **Talk to Customers**: Find ways to talk to customers, even if it means leveraging personal networks for consumer products or internal teams (sales, account managers, support) for B2B environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>. This can be automated by allowing customers to opt-in for interviews while using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>.
*   **Understand Business Outcomes**: Work to understand how the current prescribed work contributes to the business and [[product_strategy_stack | product strategy]] outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. This broader context enables better daily decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>.
*   **Empowerment**: By taking initiative and focusing on developing [[career_advice_and_frameworks | discovery habits]], individuals can improve their work without waiting for permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>.

## Connection to Continuous Discovery

The Opportunity Solution Tree is a key tool for practicing continuous discovery. "Continuous discovery" involves continually making decisions about what to build by continuously including the customer in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a>.

Instead of thinking of discovery and delivery as separate phases, they are continuous and parallel activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. Everything in a backlog is a "bet," and discovery helps make *better* bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Continuous discovery, through practices like interviewing and assumption testing, fosters a habit that improves the quality of these "bets" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## Mitigating Risk and Fostering Collaboration

The OST encourages a critical assessment of risk associated with solutions. For core product functionality or differentiators that require robust solutions, it's beneficial to:
*   **Generate Multiple Solutions**: Work with several solutions for the same opportunity to compare and contrast their pros and cons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:43:00">[31:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:59:00">[31:59:00]</a>.
*   **Instrument and Measure Impact**: Continuously instrument products and measure the impact of releases to refine judgment on where risk exists and how much discovery is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>.

The OST also promotes collaboration within the "trio" (product manager, designer, and software engineer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:33:00">[33:33:00]</a>. A well-functioning trio works from a shared understanding, reducing disagreements and prompting them to seek better options when they do disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>. This collaborative approach leads to better products than a siloed, politically driven environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>.

Cursor, developed by Any Sphere, is recognized as the leading [[role_of_ai_in_developer_productivity | AI code editor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>, at the forefront of transforming how engineers and product teams build software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Co-founder and CEO Michael Tru describes Cursor's goal as inventing "a new type of programming," leading to a world "after code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## A Vision Beyond Code

Michael Tru envisions a future where being an engineer feels more like being a logic designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The core idea is to distill software building down to describing intent to the computer in the most concise way possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. This future involves a representation of software logic that looks more like English or an evolution towards pseudo-code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

Michael contrasts this vision with two common perspectives:
1.  **Software building remaining largely the same**: Continued reliance on text editing formal programming languages like TypeScript, Go, C, and Rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
2.  **Chatbot/Slackbot style interaction**: Users type into a bot to build or modify software, treating the AI as an engineering department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. Tru believes the latter lacks precision for developers who need complete control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

The company believes that the human must remain in the driver's seat, retaining control over all aspects of the software and having the ability to make very quick changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. In this "after code" world, the value of "taste" in [[impact_of_ai_tools_on_future_product_development_skills | product development skills]] will increase, moving from carefulness to having the right idea for what should be built <a class="yt-09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

## Origin Story and Initial Traction

Cursor's inception was a "solution search of a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. The initial spark came from two key observations in late 2021 and early 2022:
1.  **GitHub Copilot**: Using the first beta version of Git Copilot was the first time Michael and his co-founders used an AI product that was "really, really, really useful" and proved to be one of the most useful dev tools they had ever adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
2.  **AI Scaling Papers**: Papers from OpenAI and other organizations demonstrated that AI would continue to improve simply by scaling models and data, even without new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

These insights ignited excitement about the possibilities of [[new_applications_of_ai_in_startups | AI products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Initially, the team mistakenly believed the coding space would be "uncompetitive and sleepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a> and spent four months working on tools to automate mechanical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. They lacked excitement for the field and faced challenges with data availability for custom models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

The pivot back to programming came from noticing that despite time passing, not much had changed in the space, and existing efforts lacked ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Rapid Development and Public Launch
The team began building Cursor with a bias towards rapid iteration and public release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. The very first version of Cursor was hand-rolled from scratch, encompassing core editor functionalities like language support, navigation, error tracking, and command-line integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

After just five weeks, the team was "living on the editor full-time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. A short beta period followed, leading to a worldwide launch within three months of the first line of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

The initial expectation was to build for a few hundred people for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>, but there was an immediate "crush of interest and a lot of feedback" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. This early feedback was crucial, leading to the decision to base Cursor on VS Code rather than a completely custom build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Unprecedented Growth

Cursor has achieved historic growth:
> [!quote] Growth Milestones
> *   **$0 to $100 million ARR** in 20 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>
> *   **$300 million ARR** just two years after launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>

Tru notes that the growth has been "fairly just consistent on an exponential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, accelerating at times due to launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Secrets to Success

Michael Tru attributes Cursor's success to a "sustained paranoia" about improving the product, recognizing they are "very, very far away" from their end goal of inventing a new form of programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The key has been the "continued evolution of the tool and just making the tool consistently better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

Cursor's approach was heavily product-led, prioritizing building a product loved by the team and then adjusting it based on user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. They "let those fires ear for a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a> on traditional sales and marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

The [[ai_product_development_challenges | challenges]] in this domain include navigating a new form of [[prototyping_and_building_with_ai_tools | product building]] that sits between a normal software company and a foundation model company. This requires not only developing an excellent product for millions but also making significant advancements on the science and model side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Counterintuitive Lessons

One of the most counterintuitive lessons learned by the Cursor team was the necessity of their own model development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Initially, they didn't expect to do any, calculating that training models like GPT-4 was beyond their scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

However, "every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. While they still utilize the biggest generative models (like GPT, Sonnet, Gemini), their custom models fill critical gaps:
*   **Speed and Cost**: For use cases like autocomplete, where predictions are needed within 300 milliseconds and at high volume, custom models are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. These models are specialized for autocompleting "a series of diffs" rather than generic text sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Complementing Foundation Models**: Smaller, specialty models assist larger foundation models by:
    *   **Input Side**: Searching codebases to find relevant parts to show big models (like a mini-Google search for code) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
    *   **Output Side**: Taking high-level "sketches" of changes from smart models and filling in the details to turn them into full code diffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

This "ensemble of models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a> approach, often starting from open-source pre-trained models, has been crucial for quality and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

## Defensibility and Market Outlook

Michael Tru believes that defensibility in the AI space isn't about traditional moats, but about constantly building the best product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. He compares the market to early search engines or the development of personal computers, where the ceiling was incredibly high, and continuous innovation yields significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. This requires constant innovation and a high R&D investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

Tru believes the market for [[role_of_ai_in_enhancing_productivity_tools | AI tools]] for programmers is "much bigger than people have realized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, given the vast potential for automating busywork in knowledge work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. While there will be many solutions, he predicts one company will eventually build "the general tool that builds almost all the world's software," a "generationally big business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

Regarding competitors like Microsoft's Copilot, Tru suggests that while they were an inspiration, this market is "not super friendly to incumbents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a> because it's easy for users to switch to more innovative products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## Hiring Philosophy and Team Growth

A key lesson for Cursor's early success, though learned slowly, was in hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. Michael Tru admits they "hired too slow to begin with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>, despite being incredibly patient in their search for a world-class team of engineers and researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. They prioritize candidates with intellectual curiosity, experimentation, and a level-headed, "micro-pessimistic" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

Their unique hiring process includes:
*   **Two-day Work Test**: Candidates spend two days on-site, completing a real mini-project in Cursor's codebase, largely unsupervised. This allows the team to assess real work product and cultural fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This process helps attract candidates not actively looking for new roles by giving them a chance to experience the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

Currently, Cursor is a relatively small team of around 60 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>, with a very high percentage in engineering, research, and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. This lean structure has been supported by hiring excellent individuals, allowing for less process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

## The Future of Engineers and Software Demand

Tru maintains that engineers will continue to be needed, and in fact, there will be "more demand for engineers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. While engineers will be able to accomplish much more with [[role_of_ai_in_developer_productivity | AI tools]], the demand for software is vast and lasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. He highlights the current "crazy" cost and labor intensity of building even simple software, and believes that by reducing friction and cost, the industry can create "tons and tons and tons more stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

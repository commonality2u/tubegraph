Product management is a multifaceted role that presents unique [[common_challenges_faced_by_product_teams_and_how_to_overcome_them | challenges]] and demands specific [[effective_product_management_strategies | strategies]] for success. Maggie Crowley, VP of Product at Toast, highlights key attributes of successful product managers and effective [[product_management_strategies and frameworks | strategies]] for overcoming common obstacles.

## Characteristics of Successful Product Managers

According to Maggie Crowley, the best product managers consistently exhibit three core traits, regardless of company stage (startup to enterprise) or product type (consumer to B2B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>:

1.  **Simplification and Focus**
    Product managers must be adept at breaking down complexity and identifying the single most important task at any given moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. In large companies, this involves navigating numerous priorities and OKRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. For startups, it means choosing one focus amidst many "fires" and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The ability to stick with that one thing until completion is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

    *   **Tactics for Simplifying:**
        *   **Read Aloud:** When writing, read your work out loud to identify overly complicated or nonsensical passages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
        *   **"Just Say That":** State your core message simply, as you would in conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
        *   **Edit Relentlessly:** Often, the first two paragraphs of any document can be deleted without loss of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
        *   **The Rule of Three:** Limit strategy bets, priorities, and conclusions to three main points or fewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
        *   **Focus on Impact:** Choose the action with the most impact and cut less important tasks, even if they have some value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
        *   **Seek Review:** Ask peers and mentors to help simplify your work and poke holes in your ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

2.  **Following Up on Results**
    Truly effective product managers consistently follow up on metrics and outcomes after launching a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This means going beyond just setting up a dashboard and actively checking on results weeks or months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This practice serves two purposes: it helps the PM learn and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>, and it demonstrates accountability and reliability to management, creating an "aura" of capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Maggie suggests setting calendar reminders to check dashboards and metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

3.  **"Carrying the Water" (Doing the Unglamorous Work)**
    Successful product managers are willing to do any necessary work, even if it's considered outside their official job description, boring, or unglamorous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This includes tasks like customer support, sales, marketing, writing copy, or project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. The mindset of "that's not my job" is a hindrance; instead, the best PMs "just get over and get the work done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. As the emotional center of the team, a PM's role is to keep people motivated and excited, requiring constant optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This commitment to outcomes ensures product success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

    *   **PM as the "Gap Filler":** Unlike engineers (who write code) or designers (who design solutions), PMs don't have a singular "thing" they produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. Their job is to deliver a business result, uniquely positioning them to fill any gaps to ensure the product succeeds for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

## [[Challenges and opportunities of being a product manager | Challenges and Opportunities in Product Management]]

### Common Misconceptions

Many aspiring product managers envision a glamorous role where they "run the show" and "tell people what to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. However, much of the job involves mundane and annoying tasks, such as project management and quality assurance (QA), which are often critical to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. The PM role, while offering significant ownership and power, comes with the responsibility of making the right bets and ensuring products ship successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.

### The Path to Proficiency and Promotion

Becoming proficient as a product manager takes significant time and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. Maggie Crowley notes it took her around five years to feel truly confident in her decisions after shipping many products and seeing the consequences of her choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. Her advice for [[getting_into_and_growing_in_product_management | improving product management skills]] and career progression is to "ship a lot of stuff" and gain experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. While job hopping can lead to promotions, spending extended time at one company allows a PM to observe product cycles and learn from decisions over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

*   **Breaking into Product Management:** Securing the first PM title is often the hardest step, as many hiring managers prioritize candidates with prior PM experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. Common paths include internal lateral moves within a company or joining startups, which may be more willing to hire individuals without a direct PM background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. Once the first PM job is secured, subsequent opportunities become easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>.

## Effective Product Management Documents

### Product Strategy Document

A comprehensive product strategy document helps define direction and align teams. Maggie Crowley's approach to writing a strategy document involves creating a detailed Google Doc that establishes a clear logical chain from the company's mission down to specific team priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. This document is a powerful tool for clarity and alignment, especially for higher-level strategic questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>.

*   **Key Sections of a Strategy Document:**
    1.  **Mission and Goals:** Company mission and overall goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.
    2.  **Landscape:** Current business and product status, market view, competitors, SWOT analysis, and key risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.
    3.  **Current Business Goals:** High-level company objectives for the current planning period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
    4.  **Current State:** An honest assessment of the product, business, customer feedback, support tickets, and technical hurdles/debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.
    5.  **Opportunity:** Based on the analysis, identify the top one or two opportunities, where the team can uniquely win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.
    6.  **Challenges:** Outline the difficulties in seizing the opportunity and what conditions must be true for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
    7.  **Proposed Solution:** A concise summary (ideally three bullet points) of what to build and how it might work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.
    8.  **Plan:** A sequence of actions, including resource allocation, team structure, and initial sprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

    *   **Purpose:** The strategy document serves as the PM's "homework" to build confidence in their own decisions and facilitates conversations with stakeholders, ensuring everyone understands the rationale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

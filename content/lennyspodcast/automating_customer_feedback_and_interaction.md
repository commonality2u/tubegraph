In product development, the term "Discovery" refers to the work done to decide what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. While all companies engage in discovery, the challenge lies in effectively integrating [[linears_approach_to_customer_feedback_and_product_iteration | customer feedback]] into this ongoing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Product strategist Teresa Torres emphasizes that digital products are never truly "done" and require continuous iteration and improvement as customer needs evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. This continuous evolution necessitates a "continuous mindset" for product teams, moving away from a project-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

## The Concept of Continuous Discovery

[[linears_approach_to_customer_feedback_and_product_iteration | Continuous Discovery]] is defined as building in continuous feedback loops to ensure that product decisions are informed by ongoing customer input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. This approach recognizes that every item in a product backlog is a "bet," and discovery helps teams make better bets over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. It's crucial not to view discovery and delivery as separate phases, but rather as simultaneous, continuous activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. By cultivating a [[importance_of_giving_and_receiving_feedback | discovery habit]], product teams can improve the quality of their product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Overcoming "No Time for Discovery"

A common objection encountered by product teams is the belief that there's "no time for Discovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Torres suggests that this often stems from a misconception that discovery requires lengthy, project-based research methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. However, [[linears_approach_to_customer_feedback_and_product_iteration | Continuous Discovery]] can be sustained with as little as one customer interview per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

## Automating Customer Recruitment for Continuous Feedback

To make [[linears_approach_to_customer_feedback_and_product_iteration | Continuous Discovery]] sustainable, especially for busy product teams, it's essential to automate the customer recruitment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. The goal is to establish a system where interviews are automatically scheduled, making it easier for teams to conduct them regularly than to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

### Strategies for Automation

1.  **In-Product Opt-In:** For consumer products and B2B end-users, customers can opt-in to participate in interviews while actively using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. This is similar to an NPS survey, but instead of asking for a recommendation, it asks, "Do you have 20 minutes to talk to us?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. If they agree, they are sent a link to scheduling software where they can pick a time that works for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. This method means the product team literally does "nothing" to schedule the interview, only needing to show up to conduct it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
2.  **Leveraging Internal Teams:** For B2B buyers and decision-makers, internal teams like sales, account managers, and support, who are already in regular contact with these customers, can facilitate recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. The product team defines a weekly "trigger" – a specific need or pain point they want to learn about – and the internal teams use scheduling software to book relevant customers for interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

### Recommended Tools

*   **Scheduling Software:** Tools like Calendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>, Outlook, Google's scheduling tool, and even Salesforce's scheduling features can be used to automate meeting bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
*   **In-Product Intercept/Survey Tools:** For triggering opt-in requests within the product, tools such as Qualaroo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>, Ethnio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>, Intercom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>, Usabilla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>, Chameleon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>, and potentially Hotjar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>, enable this type of interaction.

These automation strategies ensure that product teams can consistently gather rich customer stories, even in fast-paced environments, leading to deeper understanding of customer needs and the development of better products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

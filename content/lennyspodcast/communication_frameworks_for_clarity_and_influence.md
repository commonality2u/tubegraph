Effective communication is identified as a crucial skill for product leaders and individuals aiming for career advancement, to the point where "communication is the job" in leadership roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:01">05:01:01</a>. Wes Ko, an expert in executive communication, emphasizes that communication is a skill that can be honed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:09">08:07:09</a>.

## Core Principles of Effective Communication

### Taking Agency
When communication doesn't yield the desired reaction (confusion, skepticism, apathy), it's beneficial to ask how one might be contributing to the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">00:00:11</a>. Instead of blaming others for misunderstanding, focus on explaining things more clearly, being more compelling, and anticipating questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">00:00:16</a>. This involves reflecting on how to improve the skill of communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:43">08:04:43</a>.

### Practicing Like It's Game Day
To genuinely improve [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | executive communication]], it's important to treat every stakeholder interaction as if it's high-stakes, rather than saving one's best behavior only for executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:48">08:54:48</a>. Regular practice with all team members, managers, and direct reports provides necessary "reps" to get better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:10">09:09:10</a>. The goal of communication is to achieve the ideal outcome, such as buy-in or making good decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:06">10:26:06</a>.

## Communication Frameworks and Techniques

### "Sales then Logistics"
A common mistake is overestimating audience buy-in and jumping straight into the "how" (logistics and details) before the audience has decided if they even want to do the "thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:44">11:08:44</a>. A "sales note" should precede a "logistics note" to get people excited and agree to the idea first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:07">11:42:07</a>.
*   **Sales Note**: Explains *why* something is being done, why it matters to the company, and why now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:08">12:11:08</a>.
*   **Logistics Note**: Provides the details on *how* to do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:22">11:19:22</a>.

Even when people have generally bought in, a brief "sales" reminder (1-2 minutes or a couple of sentences) can prevent "cold starts" and reinforce the purpose of the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">14:55:00</a>. This is particularly relevant when communicating to leaders who have many things on their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:13">17:13:13</a>. [[differentiating_messaging_for_effective_sales | Differentiating messaging for effective sales]] helps tailor the approach to secure buy-in.

### Conciseness in Communication
[[techniques_for_being_more_concise_in_communication | Conciseness]] is about economy of words and the density of insight, not merely absolute word count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:02">18:40:02</a>. A bottleneck to conciseness is often a lack of clarity about one's own core point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:01">19:41:01</a>.

*   **Preparation is Key**: The clearer one is before a meeting, conversation, or pitch, the more concise they can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:53">20:50:53</a>. Even 30 seconds to 1 minute of preparation to consider the meeting's purpose and what to convey can significantly improve focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">21:38:00</a>.
*   **Self-Review**: Reminding oneself to be concise and rereading one's own message can lead to trimming 20% or more of content and improving clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:43">22:52:43</a>.
*   **Impact of Poor Writing**: A poorly written memo or message can have a large "blast radius," leading to unnecessary back-and-forth and wasted time for many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:07">25:41:07</a>. A small upfront investment in clarity can save significant time later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">38:52:00</a>.

### "Signposting"
[[crafting_compelling_presentations | Signposting]] involves using specific words, phrases, and structure to guide the reader or listener and signal upcoming information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:13">27:39:13</a>.

*   **Examples of Signposting Words**: "for example," "because," "as a next step," "first," "second," "third" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:06">28:06:06</a>.
*   **Verbal Signposting**: In conversations or demos, phrases like "the most important part to pay attention to is..." or "the part that we were most surprised by is..." can grab attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">29:11:00</a>.
*   **Formatting**: Use formatting (bolding, italics, underlines) sparingly; if everything is highlighted, nothing stands out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:16">29:59:16</a>. Avoid overusing bullet points with sentence fragments; complete sentences often reveal clearer thinking and logical flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:00">30:21:00</a>.

### Finding the Right Level of Confidence
It's crucial to speak accurately about one's level of conviction and the evidence available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:12:35">43:12:35</a>.

*   **Avoid Overconfidence**: Don't state hypotheses as facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:53:13">42:53:13</a>. If something is an initial hunch, state it as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:24:24">43:24:24</a>. Overreaching on confidence can lead to misallocation of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:41:20">43:41:20</a>.
*   **Avoid Under-confidence**: Don't diminish strong recommendations by saying things like, "you can ignore everything I just said" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:08:00">44:08:00</a>. If there are strong reasons for a recommendation, it's almost irresponsible not to convey that conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:35:00">44:35:00</a>.
*   **Share Point of View with Evidence**: Share a point of view, back it up with evidence, logic, first principles, examples, or data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:11:00">45:11:00</a>. Frame it appropriately, e.g., "my initial thinking is..." or "based on what we know, my hunch is..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">45:51:00</a>.
*   **Avoid Being a "Single-minded Martyr"**: Don't solely focus on pushing one's own agenda or recommendation, especially if it doesn't align with broader company priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:52:00">46:52:00</a>. Understand the larger organizational context and be willing to right-size proposals if they don't fit current company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:19:00">48:19:00</a>. Always prioritize what's best for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:04:00">49:04:00</a>.

### "Most Obvious Objection (MOO)"
MOO stands for "most obvious objection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:28:00">50:28:00</a>. This framework helps anticipate questions and avoid being blindsided in meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:34:00">50:34:00</a>.

*   **Anticipate**: Spend a few minutes thinking about obvious objections or counterarguments likely to arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:46:00">50:46:00</a>. This deep understanding of one's own argument makes one less likely to be caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:09:00">51:09:00</a>.
*   **Pre-empt**: If an objection is anticipated, proactively address it upfront in the communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:09:00">52:09:00</a>.
*   **Mental Filter**: MOO serves as a mental filter to encourage structured, ahead-of-time thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:01:00">52:01:00</a>. It also helps in empathizing with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:40:00">52:40:00</a>.
*   **Self-Correction**: Thinking about MOO can reveal gaps in one's own plan, allowing for strengthening the pitch before it's delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:00">53:01:00</a>.

### Staying Calm in High-Stakes Conversations
When asked a question and the answer isn't immediately known, avoid making something up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:46:00">54:46:00</a>. Instead of a default "I'll get back to you," try to continue the conversation in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">55:00:00</a>.

*   **Address the "Question Behind the Question"**: Try to understand the underlying concern driving the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:03:00">56:03:00</a>. Answer a similar question in the direction the person might be asking about, then validate their reasoning for asking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:48:00">55:48:00</a>.
*   **Reflect Back**: If unsure, reflecting back the question ("Let me just make sure I understand what you're looking for...") can buy time to think and shows the other person they are heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:57:00">56:57:00</a>. [[conversational_public_speaking_techniques | Conversational public speaking techniques]] often emphasize active listening and clarifying questions.

### Managing Up
[[the_importance_of_managing_up_and_sharing_your_point_of_view | Managing up]] is a skill that remains important throughout one's career, even as seniority increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:36:00">59:36:00</a>. The higher one goes, the more ambiguity they face, necessitating proactive communication with leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">01:00:09</a>.

*   **Share Your Point of View (POV)**: Instead of asking managers "what should we do?", offer a recommendation: "Here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">01:01:36</a>. This reduces cognitive load on the manager and demonstrates strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">01:01:48</a>.
*   **Actively Observe and Analyze**: Don't just report data; provide insights and takeaways. Look for problems, form hypotheses, and share what is being observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">01:02:38</a>. This proactive approach helps junior people get promoted and take on more leadership opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">01:03:07</a>. This is part of broader [[career_advice_and_frameworks | career advice and frameworks]].

### Giving Effective Feedback
The framework "strategy not self-expression" highlights that the goal of feedback is to motivate behavior change, not to vent frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">01:06:06</a>.

*   **Focus on Behavior Change**: Trim everything that doesn't contribute to motivating the person to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">01:06:09</a>. Focus on the benefit of the change to the individual and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">01:06:24</a>.
*   **Vent Separately**: Before giving feedback, vent frustrations to a trusted person (e.g., therapist, partner) to clear energy and maintain a calm, positive tone during the actual conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">01:07:24</a>. This is a key aspect of [[techniques_for_effective_feedback_and_communication | Techniques for effective feedback and communication]].

### Delegating Effectively: The CEDAF Framework
CEDAF helps maintain high standards while delegating, preventing common pitfalls like insufficient instruction or lack of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">01:10:05</a>.

*   **C (Comprehension)**: Ensure the delegated person has everything they need to understand the task, including logins, tools, and the desired end result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">01:10:22</a>.
*   **E (Excitement)**: Explain the "why" behind the task to make it exciting and connect it to larger project goals or career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">01:10:45</a>.
*   **D (Derisk)**: Anticipate and mitigate obvious risks, such as the person going in the wrong direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">01:11:08</a>. This is similar to the MOO concept.
*   **A (Align)**: Provide opportunities for the delegated person to ask questions and confirm understanding, ensuring true alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">01:11:59</a>.
*   **F (Feedback)**: Establish the shortest possible feedback loop. Check in frequently in the early stages, even within the same conversation, to course-correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">01:12:42</a>.

### The "Swipe File"
A "swipe file" is a collection of inspiration for future reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">01:17:04</a>. For communication, this could include well-articulated phrases, strategic statements, or examples of effective arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">01:17:26</a>.

*   **Benefits**: The act of adding to the swipe file trains one to notice effective communication in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">01:17:50</a>. It also provides a resource to analyze and break down effective structures and arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">01:18:53</a>.
*   **Implementation**: It can be as simple as a messy notes file; the focus is on the act of collection and observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">01:19:27</a>.

## Practicing Communication Skills
To improve communication, track the time it takes to get the desired reaction from recipients. If it involves too much back-and-forth, it signals an area for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">01:13:02</a>.

*   **Experimentation**: Approach improvement with a "hypothesis-driven experimental mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:23">01:34:23</a>. Test different framing or tactics and observe the reactions.
*   **Focus on One Thing**: Avoid trying to incorporate too many tactics at once, which can lead to overwhelm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">01:40:40</a>. Pick one specific skill to work on, practice it in various settings, and master it before moving to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:07">01:35:07</a>.
*   **Compounding Effect**: Seemingly minor improvements in communication compound over time, leading to significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:29">01:36:29</a>. Many "big" things are already being done, so focusing on "boring" or "basic" skills can provide an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:30">01:37:30</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Communication
AI tools like Claude can be valuable thought partners for improving communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">01:20:20</a>.

*   **Drafting and Refining**: Use AI to generate initial drafts of emails or responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">01:20:30</a>.
*   **Providing Context**: The more context and personal perspective given to the AI (e.g., explaining a difficult "no" or desired tone), the better the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">01:20:46</a>.
*   **Iterative Process**: Edit the AI's output to match one's voice, then feed it back to the AI for further improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">01:21:33</a>.
*   **AI as a "Delegatee"**: The CEDAF framework for delegation can apply to prompting AI agents, ensuring clarity (comprehension), conveying importance (excitement), anticipating issues (derisking), confirming understanding (alignment), and using iterative prompts (feedback) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:54">01:40:54</a>. [[the_importance_of_communication_in_product_management | Product management insights and extreme clarity]] are enhanced by effective communication with AI.

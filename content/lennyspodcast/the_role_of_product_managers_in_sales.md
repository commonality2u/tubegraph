In the world of B2B SaaS, the relationship and [[collaboration_between_product_and_sales_teams | collaboration between product and sales teams]] are crucial for success. While [[role_of_product_leaders | product leaders]] may have the least experience in building sales teams, their involvement is vital. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>

## Product Leaders' Involvement in Sales

Founders, and by extension [[role_of_product_managers | product managers]], are often "A+ middlers" in sales discussions. This means they excel at talking about the product and the market, even if they struggle with initial outreach or closing deals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a> Customers appreciate speaking directly with the CEO or a product leader, as it offers a level of insight and connection typically unavailable with larger companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>

### Product as a Sales Weapon
The Head of Product, or an empowered [[role_of_product_managers | product manager]], can be a "magical weapon" in sales, particularly for large deals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a> Their deep product knowledge and ability to make commitments or suggest workarounds can be instrumental in closing complex deals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a> For instance, a Head of Product can swiftly address customer needs, such as deconstructing a product or tailoring a UI, which a sales representative may not be empowered to do. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>

This involvement is critical because:
*   **Sales teams lack deep product knowledge:** Sales representatives typically cannot explain complex technical details or how a product works beyond basic questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>
*   **Empowerment for commitments:** Only a product leader with deep product fluency and gravitas can make commitments to large customers regarding product changes or integrations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>

### Interviewing Sales Talent
When hiring early sales talent, [[role_of_product_managers | product managers]] should look for candidates who demonstrate deep product understanding and a problem-solving mindset. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:22">[03:22:22]</a> A key interview technique involves asking the candidate to "sell me this app." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:22">[03:22:22]</a> This tests their ability to grasp the product's core problems and solutions, rather than just reciting acronyms or talking points from their resume. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:22">[03:22:22]</a> Candidates should ideally have experience selling a product that was "harder to sell" than yours, as this indicates resilience and adaptability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>

## Managing Feature Requests from Sales

The tension between product and sales over feature requests is a sign of a healthy B2B company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> To manage this effectively:
*   **Allocate a Budget:** Give the Head of Sales a fixed budget for feature requests each quarter (e.g., 10% of story points). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> This forces sales to prioritize what's most important for their deals, as they are not product people and may overreact to stressful deals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>
*   **Weekly Meetings:** Hold weekly meetings between the VP of Sales and VP of Product to discuss these budgets and priorities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a> This structure encourages sales teams to internally rank their feature needs and provides a clear channel for communication and commitment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>
*   **Push Decisions Up:** Individual contributors in product and sales should elevate critical decisions to their respective managers, preventing widespread disruption. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>

## Product's Role in Pricing, Trials, and Customer Experience

[[role_of_product_managers | Product managers]] should act as the "voice of the customer" alongside founders. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>

*   **Trial Lengths:** Be cautious of short trial lengths (e.g., 14 days) driven purely by sales' desire to close deals faster, as this may not be customer-centric. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a> Longer or even infinite trials (like Slack or Canva historically) can foster usage and compounding revenue. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>
*   **Annual Contracts:** Avoid forcing customers into annual contracts, especially for SMBs, as this can be customer-hostile and negatively impact Net Retention Rate (NRR) and Net Dollar Retention (NDR). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a> Customers prefer to pay how they want, and forcing annual payments can lead to churn. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>
*   **Freemium and Value:** Product teams should champion freemium models and focus on delivering more value than they take out. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:12">[01:37:12]</a> Products with free editions often force better onboarding and overall product quality, benefiting all customers, including enterprises. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:12">[01:37:12]</a>
*   **Churn:** For Product-Led Growth (PLG) models, relentlessly reducing churn is the most critical metric. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>

## Broader Role of Product in a Customer-Centric Business

Product teams should be the "Vanguard" of their companies, injecting energy and focusing on customer delight. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> This means:
*   **Customer-Centricity:** Prioritizing customer needs over short-term revenue goals, especially after periods of market stress. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>
*   **Earning Price Increases:** If prices are raised, ensure that significant value is added to the product to justify it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:10">[01:36:10]</a>
*   **Shipping Great Things:** Focus on shipping a few truly great features or products each year. This inspires the entire company, including sales and [[the_role_of_marketing_in_product_success | marketing]], and fosters growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>

Ultimately, [[role_of_product_managers | product managers]] have a crucial role in shaping a company's sales motion, not just by building great products, but by actively engaging with customers, balancing internal priorities, and championing customer-centric growth.

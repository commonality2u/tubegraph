## The Purpose of Interview Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

This compilation of favorite interview questions from over 100 podcast guests can be used by interviewers to improve their questions or by candidates to prepare for potential questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Questions That Reveal Storytelling Ability

Many effective interview questions prompt candidates to recount past experiences, allowing them to demonstrate skills through narrative.

### Self-Awareness and Curiosity
*   **"To what do you attribute your success? (You can't say luck.)"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
    *   Aka demano, Head of Product at Roll and former PM at Stripe, uses this question to assess how self-aware and curious a candidate is about their own journey and achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **"What would your siblings say about you?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>
    *   Melum Quan Burwitz, Head of Growth at Deal, looks for sincerity and self-awareness in the response. A good answer acknowledges potential quirks, showing humility, rather than presenting a flawless image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. If a candidate doesn't have siblings, the question can be adapted to "what would your parents say about you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **"Fast forward three years, what's different about you?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>
    *   Ben Williams, former VP Product at Snyk, uses this to find signals of humility and self-awareness regarding personal and professional growth areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. He appreciates candidates who are open about where they need to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   Williams also generally looks for curiosity throughout interviews, noting that good PMs ask "why" often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **"Do you consider yourself lucky?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>
    *   Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, finds this a fascinating question to test introspection. Those comfortable admitting luck often show maturity and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

### Problem-Solving and Navigating Ambiguity
*   **"What's the hardest thing you've ever done?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
    *   Jeff Charles, Head of Product at Ramp, asks this to understand a candidate's definition of "hard," how they overcame difficulty, how they collaborated with others, and their agency in the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **"A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you to bring this to market. What do you do?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
    *   Shashir Marocha, CEO and Co-founder of Coda, uses this open-ended question to see how candidates prioritize information. After an initial flurry of questions, he reveals the scientists will only answer two questions before expecting a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   The goal is to identify candidates who can quickly pinpoint the most impactful "one or two core questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For example, a candidate asked: "Is it safe enough for humans?" and "Is it more expensive (CAPEX or OPEX) to buy or run them?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. These two questions allow for framing different market approaches (e.g., human fax machines vs. airport replacements vs. cargo transport) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   This exercise tests the ability to simplify complex problems, a skill often found naturally in children but sometimes lost in adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **"Describe to me a time when you were part of a controversial product decision"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a> or **"Talk about a big problem that you worked on."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
    *   Yuki Yamashita, CPO at Figma, looks for candidates who can articulate the conflict, represent both sides fairly, and maintain an even-keeled perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   For the problem question, the interviewer should feel "compelled to work on that problem" after hearing the candidate's explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. A strong candidate can make even a "boring" problem sound existential and interesting, demonstrating [[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_presentations | storytelling]] and [[how_storytelling_creates_memorable_communication | communication]] skills essential to [[product_management_and_storytelling | product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **[[behavioral_interview_techniques | Behavioral interview techniques]]**: Jay Z, Head of Product at Webflow, uses these to understand how candidates navigate ambiguous or challenging situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
    *   Good answers show candidates who can structure a path forward through ambiguity and seek inputs from others, rather than charting a single, unwavering course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. They also look for how candidates define "little milestones" to assess if their path is working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **"Tell me about a time something went wrong."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>
    *   Paige Castello, Co-Head of Product Management at Asana, uses this to evaluate a candidate's mindset and how they talk about failures (product or team-related). This reveals how they perceive themselves when things aren't going well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **"Tell me something you did that worked out but not for the reason that you thought it would work"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a> or **"tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>
    *   Iho Omalo, CPO at Carbon Health, uses these questions to assess introspection. He looks for candidates who are reflective about their decisions, why they succeeded or failed, and how they incorporate that learning into future choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **"What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>
    *   Naval Singhal, VP of Product at Facebook, asks this to break the typical "interview mindset" where candidates try to predict what the interviewer wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This question requires a genuinely opinionated response, revealing authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

### Demonstrating Pride, Values, and Impact
*   **"Tell me what work you are most proud of."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>
    *   Katie Dill (Head of Design at Stripe), Ki Sarin (CEO of Linear), and Camille Hurst (Product Leader at Spotify) all favor this question. It helps understand a candidate's taste, judgment, motivations, and what they consider a "good outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. It's a positive way to learn about a person's values and how they think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **"Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>
    *   Lauren Isord, Head of Growth at Notion, uses this to understand how candidates define "impact." For a growth practitioner, a good answer shows intrinsic motivation to impact the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

### Additional Insights for Interviewers
*   **Reference Calls**: When checking references, Paul Adams, CPO at Intercom, suggests asking: "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a> This question is difficult to evade and provides honest insight into areas for growth.
*   **DEI Initiatives**: A candidate asked Ben Williams, "Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> This allows candidates to assess alignment of their personal values with the company or interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

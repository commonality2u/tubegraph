Graham Weaver, a professor at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and CEO of Alpine Investors, observes that a common question he receives is "What should I do with my life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. He helps students and individuals break free from what he calls "autopilot mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.

## Understanding Autopilot Mode

Autopilot mode describes a state where individuals are largely unconscious, often not realizing why they are doing what they are doing, or even what they are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. Many people operate through their days unconsciously, following routines without deep intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. An example of such a day might include: waking up, working out, driving to work, battling traffic, attending meetings, returning emails, fighting traffic on the way home, rushing through dinner, and going to bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. This type of day, though busy, lacks intentionality and a connection to personal values or long-term aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>.

A significant reason for being in autopilot mode is that 95-98% of our thoughts are subconscious, programmed by external factors like media, friends, parents, and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">[01:54:54]</a>. This programming influences what we think we're "supposed to do," leading to unconscious living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>.

## The Importance of Intentionality

Breaking out of autopilot mode involves bringing intentionality to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. By defining where one wants to be going and what is important, individuals can begin to work backward to align their daily actions with their deepest desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. This shift allows for a life lived without regret, feeling like one is fulfilling their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

Weaver suggests that following one's genuine energy and passion, rather than external scorecards, leads to greater success and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>. When aligned with internal desires, individuals develop a "superpower" of increased energy, willingness to work harder and longer, and an ability to attract others who share their excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:43">[02:43:43]</a>.

## Practical Approaches to Breaking Autopilot

### The Genie Framework

This exercise helps individuals uncover their true desires by removing the fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:12">[09:12:12]</a>.
Imagine finding a magic lamp with a Genie who grants one wish: "Whatever you throw yourself into with your whole life and your career, it's going to turn out great. It's probably going to take longer than you think, it's going to be harder than you think, but you're going to be really happy you did, and it's going to work out beyond your wildest imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:55">[09:55:55]</a>. The question then becomes: "What would you wish for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:11">[10:11:11]</a>. The answer is often close to one's heart, representing a path they would pursue without the fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:25">[10:25:25]</a>. The second part of the exercise is to then pursue that "Genie goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:34">[10:34:34]</a>.

### Other Powerful Questions

To further stimulate intentional thinking, consider these questions:
*   "What would you do if you knew you wouldn't fail?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:15">[16:15:15]</a>
*   "If you didn't have to make money, what would you do?" (to understand what you enjoy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:35">[16:35:35]</a>
*   Naval Ravikant's question: "What's play for you that is work for other people?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:45">[16:45:45]</a>
*   "What's the thing you really want to do but you're just too embarrassed to say it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:02">[17:02:02]</a> (Weaver's answer was to be a motivational speaker like Tony Robbins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:07">[17:07:07]</a>.)
*   "Who are some people that you admire and want to be more like, and what do they do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:20">[17:20:20]</a>
*   "What are some things you want to learn and how do you want to grow over the next 5-10 years?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:30">[17:30:30]</a>

### Overcoming Limiting Beliefs

Limiting beliefs are most dangerous when subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:15">[18:15:15]</a>. The first step to overcoming them is to write them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:15">[19:15:15]</a>. This act immediately strips them of their power and scariness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:23">[19:23:23]</a>. What was a scary subconscious fear becomes a tangible to-do item that can be consciously addressed and overcome, like any other problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:39">[19:39:39]</a>.

### The "Nine Lives" Exercise

This exercise helps make the concept of a "life purpose" less intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:31">[20:31:31]</a>.
1.  **Life One**: Describe your current life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:39:39">[43:39:39]</a>.
2.  **Eight More Lives**: Envision eight other lives you would be excited to live, starting from today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:04:04">[44:04:04]</a>. Examples could include starting a private equity firm, becoming an author, a professor, or an actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:16:16">[44:16:16]</a>.

The purpose is two-fold:
1.  **Integrate Passions**: Identify a life that gives you the most energy and integrate aspects of it into your current life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:57">[44:57:57]</a>. For instance, if podcasting is one of your "nine lives," start doing it every other week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:15">[45:15:15]</a>. This provides tremendous energy in all areas of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:31:31">[45:31:31]</a>.
2.  **Long-term Vision**: Realize that it's possible to experience many, if not all, of these "lives" over the course of a lifetime, though not simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:55:55">[45:55:55]</a>.

### Avoiding "Not Now"

A common trap is saying "not now" to a dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:34:34">[47:34:34]</a>. This often turns into "not ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:40:40">[47:40:40]</a>. It's crucial to realize that there's never a "right time" to make a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:07:07">[48:07:07]</a>. Making a change will always feel insecure and fearful, and one will feel like they're not ready or lack a clear plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:17:17">[48:17:17]</a>. Waiting for "the clouds to part" means waiting a whole lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:35:35">[48:35:35]</a>. Instead, consider what your five-year-future self would wish you were doing right now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:57:57">[48:57:57]</a>.

### Creating Accountability

[[creating_accountability_for_personal_growth | Accountability]] is key to living an intentional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:49:49">[36:49:49]</a>.
*   **Executive Coach**: Similar to hiring a personal trainer for physical goals, an executive coach helps create space for asking big life questions (career, relationships, health, spirituality) and provides [[creating_accountability_for_personal_growth | accountability]] to act on intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:40">[37:40:40]</a>. Even filling out a form with goals and weekly actions can be incredibly powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:32">[38:32:32]</a>.
*   **Like-minded Friend**: If a coach is not feasible, find a friend who can serve a similar role, holding each other accountable and discussing dreams and hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:14:14">[39:14:14]</a>. Talking about goals activates more of the brain than just thinking or writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:40">[40:40:40]</a>.
*   **Daily Writing**: A simple yet powerful practice is to write down your overarching goal each morning (e.g., "I am the number one product manager") and then list three specific actions you will take that day to move toward that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:14:14">[41:14:14]</a>. This locks your subconscious mind onto your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:36:36">[41:36:36]</a>.

### The "I Am Enough" Realization

Life often presents itself as an external journey with external obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01:01">[50:01:01]</a>. However, a "very, very large part of life is internal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:30:30">[50:30:30]</a>. People often write a story about what they *think* they need to be happy, worthy, or respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:57:57">[50:57:57]</a>. Realizing this is just a story provides agency to decide what truly matters according to one's internal scorecard, rather than external expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:31:31">[51:31:31]</a>. This realization can be terrifying at first but ultimately liberating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:48:48">[51:48:48]</a>. Weaver experienced this firsthand after achieving significant financial success with his firm, Alpine Investors, only to realize that "nothing changed" internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:08:08">[53:08:08]</a>. External achievements alone don't bring lasting joy or a sense of "enoughness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:41:41">[53:41:41]</a>.

## Mindset for the Journey

*   **Life is Suffering**: "Life is suffering, so figure out something worth suffering for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>. Regardless of the path, there will be challenges and difficulties. Choosing a path aligned with one's passion means suffering for something meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:47:47">[30:47:47]</a>.
*   **Worse First**: "Everything you want is on the other side of worse first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. Any significant positive change, whether improving physical health or changing careers, involves an initial negative phase of discomfort, effort, and possibly difficult conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:50">[31:50:50]</a>. If one only optimizes for immediate comfort, they will plateau and never move past current limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:39">[32:39:39]</a>.
*   **Time and Perseverance**: Most worthwhile endeavors take significantly longer than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:44">[02:44:44]</a>. Success stories often involve very long periods of chipping away at challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>. The biggest reason people fail is a lack of willingness to commit for the necessary time, often due to unrealistic expectations fostered by media that suggests overnight success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:56">[02:56:56]</a>.
*   **Knowing When to Quit**: Quit when you can no longer see or believe in the vision, or when you are no longer excited about it for a sustained period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. Even in dark times, look for "bright spots"—small glimmers of what's working—and scale them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.

Ultimately, the most important step in breaking out of autopilot mode is to "take the time to really figure out, answer the question: what does a wonderful, amazing, incredible life look like?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a> Get as clear as possible on this vision for all areas of your life – career, relationships, health, spirituality, finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>. The more clear and invested you are in your vision, the more likely you are to make it come true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

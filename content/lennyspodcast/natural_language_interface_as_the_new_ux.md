Aparna Shah, Chief Product Officer at Microsoft, posits that "NLX is the new UX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, referring to the Natural Language Interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This concept is a "Roman empire" for Shah, indicating its significant importance and ongoing consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## NLX vs. GUI

Traditionally, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have been consciously and explicitly designed due to their unnatural and rigid nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. In contrast, conversational interfaces and natural language offer a much more elastic interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. Despite this elasticity, it's crucial to understand that it "doesn't mean it's not designed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

Conversations possess grammars, structures, and even invisible UI elements, similar to how a podcast conversation differs from a Microsoft meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The prevailing notion that "the model eats the products" with AI, implying a simple chat interface, is a trap product builders often fall into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

## New Principles and Constructs in NLX

The evolution of natural language as an interface requires new principles and constructs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Key elements emerging in NLX design, particularly for [[AI Integration in Product Development|agents]], include:

*   **Prompts** The prompt itself is a new UI element, similar to a dropdown or a menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Plans** When a user provides a high-level goal, an [[AI Integration in Product Development|agent]] can return with a plan, ideally an editable one, which serves as a new construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **"Showing the Work" (Progress)** Products like Co-pilot and ChatGPT demonstrate "thinking aloud" or showing the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. The challenge lies in finding the right balance: too verbose, and it feels like a script; too terse, and it erodes user confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. This transparency is particularly valued now because AI tools are often perceived as black boxes, and peeking "under the hood" offers reassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. However, this may evolve over time to become more personalized based on user preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
*   **Follow-ups** Designing explicit follow-up suggestions for success is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. For example, if an [[AI Integration in Product Development|agent]] generates a black and white image, it should proactively suggest options to make it color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. The balance here is key: too many suggestions can be annoying, while too few miss an opportunity to guide the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

For product builders, NLX presents a "fun new space to be digging in" for product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. The intricate design required for seemingly simple conversations, such as controlling the level of information shared or proposing plans, might surprise many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

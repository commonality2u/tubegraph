In B2B, sales are not about selling commodities or used cars; they are about solving problems for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The role of a SaaS sales representative is to act as an expert, helping customers understand why a specific solution is the best fit, honestly addressing its limitations, and guiding them through the purchasing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. The best sales representatives are confident enough to advise customers when their product is *not* the right solution, focusing on long-term relationships rather than aggressive, transactional tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

## The Role of Sales in B2B SaaS

Most B2B businesses will eventually need a sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. While some truly self-serve products, like Canva or Slack, can defer sales hires until much later in their growth, the majority will require a sales-type motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Honesty about Sales Needs
> Founders must be honest about whether their customers require a sales motion, especially in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If initial customers need effort to deploy, have questions about security or competition, or require specific onboarding, then a purely product-led growth (PLG) motion without sales will likely fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
>
> An example: A company doing $5 million in revenue and growing over 100% with a sales-led motion decided to fire their entire sales team because the founders disliked sales. This resulted in their revenue dropping to less than $1 million in 20 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Many companies, including large ones like Atlassian and Snowflake, operate on hybrid models that combine self-serve or [[working_with_sales_in_a_productled_growth_company | product-led growth]] with sales-led motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The key takeaway is that sales is generally a matter of *when*, not *if*, for B2B companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## When to Hire the First Salesperson

Founders, even if they dislike sales, should personally close the first 10-15 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

> [!TIP] Founders as "Middlers"
> Founders are naturally excellent at the "middle part" of sales conversations – discussing the product, market, and customer problems – even if they aren't skilled at initiating cold outreach or asking for the close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Early adopters love interacting directly with the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Founders can leverage this by focusing on getting prospects into their "spider web" and then learning how to ask for next steps and ultimately, the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

Signs it's time to hire the first salesperson:
*   You've closed the first 10 customers on your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.
*   You are spending more than 20% of your time on sales activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This indicates a need for leverage.
*   You have a repeatable sales process that has consistently worked for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

## Hiring the First Sales Team

It's crucial to hire **two** initial sales representatives, not just one, to allow for A/B testing of human performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

### Qualities of Early Hires
The first sales representatives should be:
*   People you would personally **buy your product from** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This means they truly understand the product and can articulate its value and solve problems credibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   "Quirky pirates and romantics" who have genuinely fallen in love with your product, even if it's feature-poor in the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
*   Experienced in B2B sales (a couple of years) and possess sufficient maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. You need to trust them with precious early leads and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.
*   Preferably from a company where the **last product was harder to sell** than yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. This makes them more resilient and appreciative of your product's relative ease of sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. This could mean a more technical product, a more competitive market, or a more complicated business process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.

### Interview Process for Sales Reps
Founders should prepare to interview around 30 candidates for the first sales roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **The "Sell Me This App" Test:** This is the most crucial test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. Give candidates time to prepare by watching explainer videos, webinars, and customer testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. The goal is to see if they can understand and sell the product's core problem-solving capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. Many candidates fail to even watch basic product videos before interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.
*   **Avoid "LinkedIn Logos":** Don't be swayed by impressive company names on resumes if your gut tells you you wouldn't buy from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   **Reference Checks:** Despite the busy hiring environment, founders should always conduct reference checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>.
*   **Honest Conversations:** At the final stage, have an open conversation with the candidate to ensure the role is the right fit for them and avoid quick churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

### Compensation for Early Sales Hires
*   **On-Target Earnings (OTE):** Expect to pay market rates (e.g., $140K-$150K OTE for a US-based account executive, split 50% base, 50% bonus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. Don't panic about the top-line number; focus on the cash commitment for a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.
*   **Initial Ramp:** For the first three months (max one quarter), consider allowing reps to keep 100% of what they close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. This helps them put "supper on the stove" and build confidence without immediate pressure to hit aggressive quotas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Goal:** A sales rep should eventually bring in 3x-5x their total compensation (3x for SMB, 4x for mid-market, 5x for Enterprise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. When they achieve this, they are accretive to the business, and you *want* them to make a lot of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **Don't Over-Optimize:** Don't stress too much about small tweaks to the compensation plan in the early days; focus on finding reps who can bring in significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## Hiring a VP of Sales

*   **Timing:** Hire a VP of Sales only after you have **two sales representatives consistently hitting quota and closing deals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Hiring a VP of Sales before this stage is almost guaranteed to fail, as their job is to scale from 3 to 300 reps, not to establish [[the_process_of_achieving_productmarket_fit_in_b2b_saas | product-market fit]] or be the first few reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
*   **Qualities:**
    *   **Still wants to *do* sales:** In today's market, many senior sales leaders are burnt out and prefer pure management. A good VP of Sales will want to be deeply involved in deals (carrying a bag/quota, or at least joining calls 20-30 hours a week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. If they aren't actively involved in deals, they won't understand the product or sales challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
    *   **Product Guru:** The early sales team, including the VP, must be product experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. They need to understand the product's unique "10x feature" and how to navigate around its early feature gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
    *   **"Stretch VP":** For 95% of companies, the first head of sales should be a "stretch VP" – someone who was previously a director or senior director and is ready for career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. More seasoned VPs may not be willing to put in the necessary hands-on work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.
    *   **Can Source Managers:** A sales leader can scale indefinitely if they can hire and attract better managers under them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

## Sales Team Structure and Scaling

*   **Rules of Eight:** A common heuristic for scaling sales organizations is the "rules of eight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.
    *   One manager for every eight SDRs (Sales Development Representatives) or Account Executives (AEs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
    *   Eight AEs or sales executives report to a director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.
    *   Directors (and later, VPs/SVPs) maintain a similar span of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>.
*   **Key Roles:**
    *   **SDR (Sales Development Representative):** Generally an entry-level position (often recent grads, 60-80k OTE) focused on outbound emailing and dialing for dollars, and screening inbound leads. Their job is to pass leads to AEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>.
    *   **AE (Account Executive):** More seasoned professionals responsible for closing deals (90k-200k+ OTE, 50/50 base/bonus split) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>. Most AEs prefer to be handed leads rather than doing extensive outbound prospecting themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.

## Product and Sales Relationship

*   [[role_of_product_teams_in_sales | Product's Involvement in Sales]]: The Head of Product or VP of Product should be deeply involved in sales, especially for large, strategic deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. They can provide deep product knowledge, make commitments on roadmap adjustments, and act as a "mini-CEO" in critical customer meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.
    *   Even product managers or directors, if utterly fluent in the product and capable of working with large customers, can play this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>.
*   [[avoiding_product_bloat_in_b2b_software | Handling Feature Requests from Sales]]:
    *   **Allocate a Budget:** Give the Head of Sales a fixed budget (e.g., 10% of story points) for product roadmap requests each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. This forces sales to prioritize and load-balance requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>.
    *   **Weekly Meetings:** The VP of Sales and VP of Product should have a weekly meeting to discuss and align on these priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.
    *   **Push Decisions Up:** Individual sales reps should not be making roadmap commitments; they should escalate requests to their manager, who then discusses with product leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>.
    *   **Embrace Tension:** Some level of stress between product and sales is a sign of a well-run B2B company that is actively engaged in deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Pricing and Trials

*   **Trial Length:** The common 14-day trial length originated from [[salesforces_innovation_and_strategic_growth | Salesforce]] sales teams wanting to close deals within the same month, not necessarily because it was best for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>.
    *   Products like Slack, Canva, and Zoom had (or still have) infinite free trials and became "epic companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>.
    *   Product leaders should be the "voice of the customer" and advocate for the longest possible trial that is customer-centric, even if it creates tension with sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a>.
*   **Annual Contracts:** Forcing customers into annual contracts, especially for SMBs, is often "terrible advice" from VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>.
    *   Letting customers pay monthly or annually based on their preference (personal vs. enterprise procurement) leads to better customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:06">[01:33:06]</a>.
    *   [[contrarian_pricing_strategies_in_saas | Price increases]] should be *earned* by adding significantly more value to the product, not just implemented to meet short-term financial targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>.

## General Sales Philosophy

*   **Continuous Improvement:** Learn to ask for "what's the next step" at the end of every meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>. This doesn't have to be asking for money, but rather ensuring the deal moves forward (e.g., another demo, meeting with another stakeholder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>.
*   **Focus on Lost Deals:** Sales teams should spend more time analyzing and discussing deals they lost than deals they won, to learn and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>.
*   **Customer-Centricity:** Avoid "dark patterns" or "customer-hostile" tactics (e.g., hidden upsells, unearned price increases, abusive free trial policies) that prioritize short-term gains over long-term customer relationships and compounding revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
    *   For PLG companies, relentlessly reducing churn is paramount for long-term growth and reaching massive scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:39">[01:26:39]</a>.
    *   Products that offer free editions or extended trials are often inherently better because they *must* invest in onboarding and user experience without human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.

## Resources for Learning Sales

*   **SaaStr University:** A free online resource with a good course on sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:43">[01:40:43]</a>.
*   **"From Impossible to Inevitable" by Aaron Ross:** A book that interviews top sales leaders and covers many aspects of scaling sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:56">[01:59:56]</a>.
*   **Pavilion Community:** A valuable community for sales professionals and founders, offering networking and insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:43">[01:30:43]</a>.
*   **Industry Events:** Attend the top one or two best events in your industry annually. These attract the best people and vendors, fostering valuable connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:17">[01:57:17]</a>. Small customer dinners or meetups (e.g., at a local steakhouse or office space) can also be highly effective for building relationships and closing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:25">[01:52:25]</a>.

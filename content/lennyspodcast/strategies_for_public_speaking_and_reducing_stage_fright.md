Effective public speaking relies heavily on the art of storytelling, a skill that transforms forgettable presentations into memorable experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Matthew Dicks, author of "Storyworthy," emphasizes that while many in business desire to be storytellers, they often hesitate to stand out, risking being forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Human minds are not designed to remember raw data like pie charts, facts, or statistics without accompanying imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. The alternative to being forgettable is to embrace storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Core Elements of Powerful Storytelling

According to Matthew Dicks, several key components make a story impactful:

### The "5-Second Moment"
Every compelling story is centered around a singular, brief moment of transformation or realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This could be a shift from one kind of person to another (transformation) or a change in perspective (realization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The vast majority of a story (98%) provides the context needed for the audience to fully experience this pivotal moment with the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

*   **Example: Eileen's Confidence** A student, Eileen, initially lacked confidence, leading her teacher (Dicks) to worry about calling her to the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. A simple, cheeky comment from Eileen — "I don't like that cheeky smile of yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a> — revealed her newfound trust and confidence, marking the 5-second moment of realization for the teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
*   **Example: Star Wars** The first *Star Wars* film is a story about a boy, Luke Skywalker, who initially has no religion and later finds belief in "the Force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. His decision to turn off his technology and rely on the Force to guide his weapon marks his moment of transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. This resonates because it taps into the universal experience of moving from disbelief to belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:07]</a>.

### Starting at the End
For true stories, start with the outcome or the 5-second moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. The beginning and end of a story should operate in opposition to each other, highlighting the change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. This approach guarantees that the story conveys something of importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.

### The Universal Appeal of Change
Stories focused on change, rather than mere reporting of events, have greater universal appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>. While the specific content might not relate to every audience member, the emotional journey of change allows for deep connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>.

### The Dinner Test
A good story should resemble one you'd tell someone casually at dinner, albeit a "slightly elevated" version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>. Avoid theatrical "performance art" elements like unattributed dialogue or sound effects at the beginning, as these are unnatural in real conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>. The goal is to speak in a natural, relatable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>.

### Your Story
Stories must be *your* story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. Telling someone else's story lacks vulnerability and connection for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>. Even when discussing others, frame it through your own experience and how it affected or changed you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.

### Avoiding "Vacation Stories"
Most "vacation stories" are merely recounts of events that don't feature a 5-second fundamental moment of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. If a significant moment *does* occur during a vacation, focus solely on that moment, as the location's irrelevance to the story is a common pitfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>. The shortest version of every story, starting as close to the end as possible, is generally the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>.

### Stakes
Stakes are what the audience should be worried about, wondering about, or hoping for the storyteller, company, or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>. Without stakes, the audience stops listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>. Assume no one wants to hear what you have to say, and constantly strive to make them wonder what comes next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:05:00">[24:05:00]</a>.

Strategies to create stakes:
*   **Elephant**: Introduce a big, immediate concern at the beginning, even if it's not the story's main point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:00">[25:24:00]</a>. (e.g., big spaceship shooting small spaceship in Star Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>)
*   **Backpack**: Share your plan, hopes, or dreams with the audience so they invest in the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a>. (e.g., knowing the heist plan in *Ocean's 11* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>)
*   **Breadcrumbs**: Drop hints or small bits of information that build anticipation, like "Chekhov's Gun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.
*   **Hourglass**: Slow time down by adding details at moments of high suspense, prolonging the audience's anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>.
*   **Crystal Ball**: Predict a future (even a terrible or false one) to make the audience worry and invest in the story's progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:00">[27:48:00]</a>.

Stakes should build throughout the story, not just be front-loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:00">[31:45:00]</a>.

### Surprise
Surprise is a powerful element where the audience doesn't anticipate something, but once it happens, it feels inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. This requires subtly planting information earlier that makes the surprise land perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Public Speaking in Business

To avoid being forgettable in business communication, integrate storytelling:

*   **Personal Interest Inventory**: Identify aspects of your personal life that could resonate with an audience and find strategic ways to weave them into your narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Married**: Signals stability and decency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:10:00">[45:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Runners**: High intensity of connection for a small market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:08:00">[46:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Elementary School Teacher**: Evokes positive perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:38:00">[47:38:00]</a>.
    *   When asked how you're doing, offer a brief, interesting personal detail instead of a generic answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:24:00">[47:24:00]</a>.
*   **"Bricks" vs. "Band-Aids"**:
    *   **"Bricks" (Recommended)**: Build a "vault of stories" from your life that you can later deploy strategically in business contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51:00">[41:51:00]</a>. This involves becoming a storyteller and understanding how to connect personal stories to business objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:56:00">[41:56:00]</a>.
        *   **Example: Boris's Son's Baseball Game**: A factory owner tells the story of his son striking out in a Little League championship game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:21:00">[38:21:00]</a>. He then applies this story to his sales team, teaching them to process failure quickly and move on, just as his son did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>. This personal anecdote is more impactful than a direct admonishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>.
    *   **"Band-Aids"**: Trying to find a story *after* a problem arises to solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:29:00">[41:29:00]</a>. While possible, this approach doesn't foster long-term storytelling skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:37:00">[41:37:00]</a>.
        *   **Speaking with Adjacency**: Instead of matching content to content (e.g., talking about tubes to sell tubes), match theme, meaning, or message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.
            *   **Example: Biotech Company & Apples**: A scientist from a company selling specialized tubes told a story about the challenges of buying different types of apples for his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:51:00">[59:51:00]</a>. He then linked this to how his company provides specific solutions (different "apples") for particular needs, contrasting with competitors who offer a one-size-fits-all product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. This created a memorable connection and generated more leads than data-heavy presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.

*   **Four Ways to Keep People Listening**:
    1.  **Stakes**: Continuously make the audience wonder what will happen next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:28:00">[49:28:00]</a>.
    2.  **Surprise**: Deliver unexpected, yet inevitable, moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:00">[49:52:00]</a>.
    3.  **Suspense**: Keep the audience on the edge of their seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:05:00">[50:05:00]</a>.
    4.  **Humor**: Dare to be funny, which differentiates you from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:16:00">[50:16:00]</a>.
        *   **Nostalgia**: Leverage shared past experiences (e.g., old technology, childhood memories) for humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:27:00">[53:27:00]</a>. This can also demonstrate expertise by showing a deep understanding of historical market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:33:00">[56:33:00]</a>.
        *   **"One of These Things is Not Like the Other"**: Present two expected things followed by one unexpected, funny element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:54:00">[56:54:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Public Speaking Anxiety

[[overcoming_public_speaking_anxiety | Public speaking anxiety]] is a common challenge, but it can be managed:

*   **Understand Pre-Talk Nervousness**: Most nervousness occurs *before* you begin speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Once you start, much of it dissipates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Knowing this can be a relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>.
*   **Everyone is Nervous**: Realize that almost everyone, even famous speakers, experiences nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>. You are in good company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:08">[01:22:08]</a>.
*   **Preparation is Key**:
    *   **Record and Listen (Passively and Actively)**: Record your talk and listen to it repeatedly while doing other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. This helps the content "seep into your soul" and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Transitions**: People often forget transitions, not the main content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Actively practice moving between sections, knowing the "scenes" of your talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.
    *   **Avoid Memorization**: Memorizing can lead to greater anxiety if you forget a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>. Aim to remember the flow and key points rather than a precise script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>.

## "Homework for Life": Building a Story Bank

"Homework for Life" is a powerful practice to continuously generate story ideas and enhance personal reflection:

*   **Daily Reflection**: Each day, before bed, identify one moment from your day that would be worth telling as a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. Record it in a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel or Google Sheets) with the date and a brief description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.
*   **Develop a "Storytelling Lens"**: Consistently doing this trains your mind to spot potential stories, leading to a greater awareness of significant moments in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. What might have been forgotten becomes preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.
*   **Recovering Time**: This practice helps to "slow time down" by accounting for each day, preventing the feeling that time "flies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>.
*   **Pattern Recognition and Self-Discovery**: By documenting daily moments, you begin to see patterns in your life, leading to deeper insights about yourself and your relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
    *   **Example: Arguing Through Chores**: Dicks noticed a pattern of his "fights" with his wife occurring not through direct arguments, but through his aggressive performance of chores she asked him to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>. This self-discovery became a relatable story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
    *   **Example: Neighbors' Divorces**: A seemingly mundane entry about a cookout with neighbors gained profound meaning months later when both sets of neighbors announced their divorces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. This showed how seemingly insignificant moments can reveal deeper trajectories and understandings of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.
*   **Memory Recovery**: The act of looking for new stories can trigger old memories from the past, adding to your growing collection of "homework for life" moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

## The Power of "Yes"

Saying "yes" to opportunities, even when they seem crazy or undesirable, is crucial for extraordinary experiences and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>. Refusing an opportunity assumes you already know what's on the other side, which is often an arrogant and foolish presumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:52">[01:26:52]</a>.

*   A "yes" can always become a "no" later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>. You can step through a door, try something, and if it's not for you, step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>.
*   Many people say "no" out of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>. Embracing things that scare you can lead to the best outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>.
*   Saying "yes" can create unexpected causal chains, leading to new connections and unforeseen opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>.

## A Positive Mental Attitude

A positive mental attitude is a key to success, shaping how you frame life experiences and interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:38">[01:36:38]</a>. This mindset helps in navigating challenges and maintaining optimism, even when others might find it "offensively positive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:57">[01:36:57]</a>.

## Final Tactical Advice for Storytellers

To instantly improve any story you tell:

*   **Start with Location and Action**: Begin your story by clearly stating where you are and what is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>.
    *   Location activates the audience's imagination, allowing them to visualize the scene with rich detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:24">[01:38:24]</a>.
    *   Action signals that something is immediately occurring, grabbing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>.
*   **Signal to Your Audience**: For marginalized groups who might find it harder to command attention, starting with "I'm in a place doing a thing" acts as a clear signal that a story is about to begin. This encourages listeners to quiet down and offer the speaker the necessary space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>. It's like signaling that "the movie's on," and people generally quiet down during a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:38">[01:40:38]</a>.

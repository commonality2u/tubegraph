Developing a [[developing_longterm_strategic_approaches_in_product_development | long-term strategic approach]] and [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | compelling product vision]] is crucial for business success, particularly in dynamic environments. This involves not only planning for the immediate future but also projecting far ahead and making decisions that align with a broad, enduring mission.

## The Role of a Futurist Mindset
Toby, a self-described "futurist," emphasizes looking into the future and thinking backward from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>. This approach involves asking: "What would we want to have done 20 years ago on this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a> or "What's the decision our future selves would want us to make?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>. This perspective views current products as potentially inferior if primarily drawn from how things *are* or *were*, favoring what *could* or *should* be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

## The 100-Year Vision
A core element of this strategic approach is adopting a 100-year vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. This means:
*   **Focusing on Mission:** At a 100-year horizon, one cannot talk about specific software projects, but rather the enduring mission itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. For example, Shopify's mission is to make entrepreneurship more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>.
*   **Surviving for Decades:** The vision considers what will survive for 80+ years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Influencing the Path:** Recognizing that the world is "unbelievably path dependent," a [[product_strategy_and_vision_development | long-term vision]] allows a company to become part of a path that aligns with its values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Future-Casting and Decision-Making
> Future-casting is seen as extremely valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>, influencing product decisions and roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.

## Playing the Infinite Game
This [[developing_longterm_strategic_approaches_in_product_development | long-term perspective]] aligns with the concept of the "infinite game," where the primary objective is to keep playing, rather than to "win" a finite game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>.
*   **"Don't Die":** The first objective for any company is simply to not die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>.
*   **Focus on Positional Game:** Beyond survival, the focus should be on the "positional game" â€“ building territory, trust, and influence with merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>, rather than just short-term "tactics" like optimizing conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>. While tactics are necessary to stay in business, the overall value comes from the positional game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.

## Long-Term Partnerships and Positive-Sum Games
A [[developing_a_product_strategy | long-term approach]] also impacts partnerships. For example, the valuable partnership between Shopify and Stripe was built on the assumption that both companies would win their respective markets and work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.

> "On a long enough timeline, playing positive-sum games with your customers is the ultimate growth hack." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>

Companies that prioritize long-term value creation resist the temptation to pull future profits forward at a discount or defect on partnerships for immediate gains, which can compromise the entire business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>. Customers notice if a company engages in value extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.

## Driving Strategy through Dissatisfaction and First Principles
The energy source for this [[developing_a_product_strategy | strategic thinking]] is often "dissatisfaction with the status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This is because current solutions and products are often "path dependent," based on compromises or assumptions that are no longer true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

[[practical_application_of_strategic_thinking_in_business | Strategic thinking]] involves deriving solutions from [[product_strategy_and_vision_development | first principles]]:
1.  **Understand Building Blocks:** Comprehending the power and composability of all currently available building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.
2.  **Rethink Assumptions:** Periodically re-deriving every valuable decision and foundational assumption, especially when core conditions change (e.g., ability to leave home during COVID-19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
3.  **Avoid Overfitting:** Being wary of metrics that, once they become goals, cease to be good metrics (Goodhart's Law) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. Many companies overfit to quantifiable things, leaving 80% of value unaddressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
4.  **Embrace the Unquantifiable:** Being comfortable with unquantifiable elements like taste, quality, passion, love, and delight, as these can upstream affect all metrics positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>.

> "If most people are doing it a certain way, I by default don't want to do it that way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>
> "If you want to do something world class, you can't do it like everyone else." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>

This often means challenging conventional business aesthetics, where pessimism and metrics-driven approaches sound sophisticated, while optimism and focusing on "fun" sound naive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. True "alpha" in the world is often found in the unobvious but true things that people dismiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

## Practical Application
*   **"Toby Tornado":** This refers to quickly stopping projects that are not working, preventing wasted time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. It's about compressing time and ensuring people work on things they can be proud of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Direct Feedback:** Providing direct, sometimes hard-to-hear feedback, with the goal of maximizing human potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This is based on the belief that most people are far from their maximum potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Stay Close to the Metal:** Founders, especially in tech, should understand the "atomic building blocks" of their products, such as coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. Being in the details helps make informed decisions and avoids being swayed by sunk cost fallacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>.
*   **Welcome Disagreement:** Encourage disagreement to uncover unstated foundational assumptions and arrive at better solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Courage to disagree is rarer and more valuable than high IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.

## Cultivating Entrepreneurship and Lowering Complexity
Shopify's [[developing_a_product_vision_framework | vision]] is to make entrepreneurship more accessible by lowering complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. Every time a complex thing is made simpler, more businesses emerge on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. This focus on simplifying difficult tasks (like taxes or payments) reduces the need for "courage" for aspiring entrepreneurs, enabling more people to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] The Quality of Product
> "Every product in the world, the quality at the end of the day is simply a reflection of how much the people who created it gave a shit about the product." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>

A product leader's role is to ensure the team cares deeply and is "exothermically infectious" with their passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. This ensures a 10 times better product than one created purely through process or metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:15]</a>.

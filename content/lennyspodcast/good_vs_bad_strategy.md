## Good vs Bad Strategy

Strategy, at its core, is a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge, comprising a mixture of policy and action [00:05:07]. It's about dealing with an issue, a challenge, or a problem, whether it's an opportunity or a negative market force [00:06:12]. Often, it's better to think of a strategy not as a grand conceptual plan, but as an "action agenda" [00:00:00]. This approach emphasizes recognizing a problem and outlining coherent actions to address it, rather than focusing on abstract missions, visions, or values [00:58:20].

### [[elements_of_a_winning_strategy | Elements of a Winning Strategy]]: The Kernel

Richard Rumelt, author of *Good Strategy Bad Strategy* and *The Crux*, identifies three essential components, or the "kernel," of a good strategy:

1.  **Diagnosis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>
    *   An understanding of the situation you're in, identifying the key challenges that can actually be addressed [00:09:24].
    *   It involves deciding what to pay attention to and forming hypotheses about how things connect [00:09:07].
    *   A rich diagnosis goes beyond simple two-by-two matrices or five-forces analysis [00:10:21].
2.  **Guiding Policy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>
    *   This is the core of the strategy: what you are going to do, and importantly, what you are *not* going to do, to deal with the diagnosis [00:12:07].
    *   It provides a long-term sense of direction but doesn't necessarily need to change every five years, especially in stable industries [00:14:21].
    *   A guiding policy is not a list of 17 "priorities" [00:10:55]. The word "priority" means the first, not a grab-bag of everything that might matter [00:11:50].
3.  **Coherent Actions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>
    *   These are the concrete steps taken to implement the strategy [00:12:30].
    *   Actions must be coherent in several ways:
        *   They must directly address the problem identified in the diagnosis [00:13:36].
        *   They should not be self-contradictory (e.g., trying to increase growth and profit magically without considering the trade-offs) [00:12:47].
        *   They should be focused on a few, achievable things, not a diffused list of efforts [00:25:05].

> "All three elements have to be there... if anyone of three is missing something, it's not really a strategy, it's something else." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>

An example of these elements in action is Microsoft's approach to AI:
*   **Diagnosis:** Recognizing the challenge of adapting to AI [00:15:25].
*   **Guiding Policy:** Investing in a major AI leader [00:15:32].
*   **Coherent Actions:** Incorporating AI into their search engine and other products [00:15:38].

### Signs of Bad Strategy

Bad strategy often elicits a strong, relatable reaction from those who experience it [00:17:10]. Key indicators of a bad or non-existent strategy include:

*   **Mistaking Goals for Strategy:** A common "bad strategy" is merely a set of profit or performance goals [00:17:37]. These are ambitions, not strategies, and lack the actionable plan to achieve them [00:17:59]. For example, stating "our strategy is to grow faster" is a statement of values, not a diagnosis of what's holding growth back [00:19:45].
*   **Fluff and Word Salad:** Using fancy, abstract, or non-specific language to describe the situation, often to sound more "strategic" without conveying concrete meaning [00:20:24].
*   **Incoherent Actions:** Proposing actions that fight each other or are self-contradictory [00:20:59]. This can happen when an organization attempts to pursue too many disparate objectives without prioritization [00:45:48].
*   **Lack of Diagnosis:** A significant flaw is the absence of a clear understanding of the problem [00:21:18]. Strategies that jump straight to desired outcomes without analyzing *why* a problem exists are often ineffective [00:22:00]. This can be seen in public policy debates where solutions are proposed without resolving the underlying diagnosis of the issue [00:22:30].

> "If you're missing a diagnosis trying to explain what exactly is wrong it's a sign your strategy is incomplete or bad if you're missing concrete actions it's a sign that your strategy is incomplete or bad there's also I think an element of coherence the actions have to connect and there have to be a few very few of them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>

### The Importance of Focus and [[role_of_power_in_strategy | Power in Strategy]]

Focus is the fundamental source of power in strategy [00:25:09]. Just as a magnifying glass focuses sunlight to create fire, strategic effort needs to be concentrated on a specific target that can be affected [00:25:54].

*   **Exploiting Asymmetry:** In competition, power comes from an asymmetry – something that gives you an advantage over others [00:29:17]. This could be being first to market, having a unique reputation, strong relationships, or a particular customer base [00:29:38].
*   **Sources of Power:** Examples include:
    *   **Leverage:** The ability to amplify effort.
    *   **Proximate Objectives:** Clear, achievable goals.
    *   **Chain Link Systems:** Interconnected elements that create a strong whole.
    *   **Network Effects:** Where the value of a product or service increases with the number of users (e.g., social media, Amazon, Google Search) [00:35:16].
*   **Challenges in Large Organizations:** Complex organizations often struggle to focus energy due to diverse interests and funding sources, leading to a "diffusion of effort" [00:27:51]. This can make it difficult to pursue a coherent [[elements_of_a_winning_strategy | strategy]] [00:28:05]. Conversely, past strengths can become disadvantages if the market shifts [00:31:57].

To identify your power, ask: "In what way is my company different than other companies?" or "What do we know that other people don't know?" [00:32:56]. Sometimes, this means redefining your market space to highlight your unique advantages [00:33:16].

### [[identifying_strategy_and_culture_problems_disguised_as_execution_issues | Organizational Dynamics as a Hindrance to Winning Strategies]]

One of the biggest obstacles to effective strategy execution is internal organizational dynamics and politics [01:10:45].

*   **Diversity of Interest and Fear of Action:** Within organizations, people have different opinions and private interests that can clash [01:12:10]. Leaders are often hesitant to make clear choices and tell people what to do, especially if it means changing power relationships or making some individuals less "alpha" [01:16:17]. This hesitancy can freeze an organization's ability to act [01:19:18].
*   **Leadership vs. Management:** Modern management literature often focuses on "leadership" as self-perfection and vision, implying followers will naturally emerge [01:16:55]. However, effective strategy requires clear management – telling people what to do, assigning responsibilities, and ensuring coherent action [01:18:01].
*   **Nokia Example:** Nokia, once a dominant smartphone maker, lost its market position partly because it replaced engineers with lawyers and accountants who lacked a feel for hardware/software issues [01:19:56]. Additionally, a matrix organization diffused power, making it difficult for anyone to take charge and respond to market changes like the advent of the iPhone [01:20:13].

Effective strategy requires a mechanism for decision-making, where a decider can resolve disagreements and commit to a clear path, even if it means stepping on toes [01:11:06].

### [[building_strategy_skills_and_effective_goals | Building Strategy Skills]]: Developing Strategic Insight

Developing strategic insight, the ability to see a way to solve a difficult problem, is crucial but not guaranteed [01:08:52].

*   **Importance of History and Analogy:** Since strategy isn't an exact science like physics, it relies heavily on analogy to previous human experiences [01:47:57]. Reading business history, biographies, and world history can provide valuable context and examples of how others have faced and overcome challenges [00:47:29].
*   **Thinking Again:** A critical intellectual tool is to re-evaluate your diagnosis [00:52:03]. After an initial understanding ("plank"), actively seek alternative ways to look at the situation or a "bigger piece of wood" to cling to [00:52:17].
*   **Focusing on the Crux:** Strategic insight often comes from immersing oneself in the "crux" – the hardest part of a problem [01:03:01]. By focusing on what makes a situation difficult, a way around the obstacle can emerge, as seen in the design of the Louvre Pyramid or SpaceX's reusable rockets [01:06:22].

### [[strategy_in_startups_and_large_organizations | Strategy in Startups]]: Action Agendas for Founders

For startups, especially pre-product market fit, strategy involves dealing with significant uncertainty [01:20:57].

*   **Making a Bet:** Founders are essentially making a bet on a particular product-market solution [01:21:05]. This involves identifying a target market and a solution to their problem [01:22:17].
*   **Adaptation and "Switching":** Research shows that successful startups often "switch" their initial focus, realizing that a different customer or solution is more viable [01:22:35]. This requires being both convinced of success and willing to adapt when things aren't working [01:23:14].
*   **Identifying "Value Denied":** A useful exercise for founders is to identify "value denied" – things that people *should* be able to buy or experience but currently cannot, or things that could be significantly better [01:26:46]. This approach, combined with "engineering" (thinking about how something *ought* to be), can lead to new business opportunities [01:27:45].

In summary, strategy is not mysterious; it's about solving the most important, achievable problem you're facing, being focused, and acting consistently [01:31:20]. It's less about abstract "missions and visions" and more about concrete "action agendas" [00:58:14].

Effective [[collaboration_between_product_and_sales_teams | collaboration between product and engineering]] is crucial for an organization's success. Will Larson, CTO at Carta and former software [[engineering_leadership_and_strategy | engineering leader]] at Stripe, Uber, and Calm, emphasizes the importance of aligning incentives and fostering deep understanding between product managers (PMs) and engineering managers (EMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

## Evolution of the Engineer-Product Relationship

Historically, engineers often held significant leverage within companies, sometimes leading to a "coddling" approach where they were shielded from critical business problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This approach, while perhaps intended to boost retention, was ultimately detrimental to engineers' growth and organizational efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The shift in the market, particularly since the "zero interest rate era," has brought about a change, allowing companies to treat engineers more as peers, empowering them with senior leadership roles and holding them accountable for real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Core Challenges in EM-PM Relationships

Larson identifies two primary issues in EM-PM pairs:
1.  **Misaligned Incentives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>: While not always as simple as a PM seeking promotion by saying "yes" to sales, differing priorities can lead to friction. Engineers might prioritize maintainability or technical debt, while PMs might focus on aggressive timelines for market [[impact_in_product_management | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Mutual Understanding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>: Often, EMs and PMs argue without truly understanding each other's underlying needs or concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

### Bridging the Gap: Advice for PMs

To build more productive and harmonious relationships with engineering managers, PMs should:
*   **Seek Deep Understanding**: Before attempting to resolve conflicts or push for a feature, genuinely understand what the engineering manager cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Often, a compromise exists that satisfies all parties if true needs are uncovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.
*   **Recognize Invisible Constraints**: PMs might not always grasp the pressures EMs face, such as balancing the team's desire for interesting work with the need to ship potentially "boring" but vital experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. These "invisible constraints" can make EMs seem unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. Pushing to understand *why* an EM prioritizes certain technical tasks (e.g., a rewrite) can lead to honest conversations, even if there's no agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.

## Aligning Incentives: Performance Evaluation

To mitigate incentive misalignment, Carta has experimented with a system where EM-PM pairs generally receive the same performance rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. This approach, sometimes extending to business leadership in a "trifecta" model, encourages shared accountability for the entire set of business constraints, not just functional ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. This fosters a powerful idea of shared incentives, even if balancing them remains challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

## The Role of Strategy and Systems Thinking

Both PMs and EMs benefit from a clear understanding of strategy and the application of [[product_management_competencies | systems thinking]]:

### Engineering Strategy
*   **Always Present, Often Unwritten**: Just like product or business, engineering always has a strategy, even if it's not formally documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. The first step to improving it is to write it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Focus on Constraints**: Good strategy is often "boring" because it involves deliberate constraints that focus the team's energy on high-value problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. Examples include Uber's "no cloud" policy which enabled rapid global expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>, and Stripe's "Ruby monolith" strategy that focused engineers on building features rather than new tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   **Definition of Strategy**: Richard Rumelt's definition of strategy includes three components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>:
    1.  **Diagnosis**: Understanding the current status quo and real issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
    2.  **Guiding Policies**: How to address the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
    3.  **Actions**: How to implement those policies, avoiding "inert strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

### Systems Thinking
Systems thinking helps model reality by considering "stocks" (things that accumulate, like fish in a lake or candidates in a pipeline) and "flows" (movement between stocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Applied to a hiring pipeline, this means visualizing candidates moving through stages (sourced, screened, offered) and identifying where bottlenecks occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The goal is to understand where the mental model conflicts with reality to identify true problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Measuring Engineering Productivity

Measuring engineering productivity is critical, especially when teams are shrinking or efficiency is scrutinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.
*   **Engineer Feedback**: Good leaders talk to engineers, who often know if their teams are effective and why not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.
*   **Align with Business Goals**: Engineering evaluation should align with product and business goals, taking accountability for customer and product success rather than just novel systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
*   **Show Value**: Regularly showcase the roadmap of valuable, impactful contributions made in the last six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.
*   **Metrics as Diagnosis Tools**: While not perfect, metrics can provide insights. The DORA metrics (lead time, incident remediation time, failure rate, etc.) are valuable for diagnosing where to focus improvements, though they don't directly measure overall company success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
*   **Embrace Imperfection**: It's crucial to get comfortable measuring something imperfect rather than measuring nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. Metrics serve to educate stakeholders about the nuances of the data and guide understanding of engineering sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>.

## Defining Company Values

Company values should guide decision-making and reflect the organization's true nature:
*   **Honesty**: Values must be honest reflections of what the company actually does, not just aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. Claiming to be "users first" while making decisions that contradict this undermines confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.
*   **Applicability**: Values should be applicable to real problems and help navigate decisions, such as whether to optimize for one's team or the entire organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>.
*   **Reversibility**: Good values are reversible, meaning their opposite could also be a valid, though different, company value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. Values like "we build good software" or "we care about our customers" are often "identity values" that don't help in decision-making because their reverse is universally undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.
*   **Clear Boundaries**: Values should implicitly define who *doesn't* fit the company culture, acting as a hiring filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>.
*   **Fewer, Better Values**: Companies often have too many values; it's better to focus on a memorable few that truly describe who the company *is*, not just who it *wants to be* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

## Learning from Failure: The Dig 4.0 Rewrite

Larson recounts the challenging launch of Dig 4.0, a complete rewrite intended to add social functionality to the news aggregator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. This decision, often a precursor to [[challenges_in_product_management | failure]] in large-scale software projects, occurred as Dig was already struggling against social networks and an SEO change affecting its monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>.

The launch was disastrous; the site was effectively down for a month, requiring heroic efforts including writing a caching system from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. A subtle bug related to Python variable initiation caused ongoing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. While the team eventually stabilized the site, the company ultimately declined, undergoing layoffs and eventually selling for parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>. Despite the business failure, Larson views this experience as foundational to his career, providing an accelerated learning opportunity in leadership and problem-solving under extreme pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. These "type two fun" experiences, while difficult in the moment, often become the most memorable and impactful learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>.

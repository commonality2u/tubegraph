Among these insights, Doshi also highlighted the critical, yet often overlooked, aspect of [[effective_feedback_and_listening_strategies | effective listening]] in leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Shas Doshi's Bonus Question: "Am I Really Listening?"

Shas Doshi presented a "bonus question" he wished he had asked himself earlier: "Am I really listening?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. He admitted that this was perhaps the hardest question for him to confront, as he initially believed himself to be a good listener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. His previous understanding of good listening involved active techniques like recapping, making eye contact, and reiterating what was heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

### The "Other Level" of Listening

Doshi realized that there is "an entirely other level to listening" beyond these conventional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. This deeper understanding of listening is crucial for [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | leaders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

He emphasizes that comprehending and practicing this advanced form of listening is what truly enables an individual to become a world-class leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. Doshi encourages leaders to consistently ask themselves, "Am I really listening?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.

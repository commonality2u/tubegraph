Building a strong product requires teams to be aligned and bought into a shared direction. This process involves clearly defining the problem, vision, and strategy, and effectively communicating these elements to all stakeholders.

## The Importance of Vision for Alignment
A clear vision is a powerful tool for product managers to [[importance_of_product_vision_and_strategy_alignment | align teams]] and enhance product success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Without a clear destination, teams might be working hard but without a shared purpose or direction, much like a pilot flying without knowing the destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

A good vision helps the team understand the future state they are building towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Elements of a Good Vision
A product or company vision should possess four key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>:
1.  **Lofty:** It should be ambitious and inspiring, almost scary in an exciting way, motivating people to strive for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Realistic and Attainable:** While lofty, it shouldn't feel so "pie in the sky" that it's out of reach for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
3.  **Devoid of Current Limitations:** It should be imagined in a vacuum, without the constraints of today's technology or limitations, as these might change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This allows for forward-thinking about what needs to be fixed or put in place to achieve the future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
4.  **Grounded in a Potent Problem:** The vision must address a clear and exciting problem that people care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Mission vs. Vision
It's important to distinguish between mission and vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>:
*   **Vision:** A picture of the future; what the world will look like when the goal is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. For example, Uber's vision of "a world where you get to this continuous trip so that you do not need parking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Mission:** The purpose, or "why," the company or team exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. For example, Uber's mission "to make Transportation reliable everywhere for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## [[steps_to_develop_and_align_on_product_positioning | Steps to Develop and Align on Product Positioning]]

Developing a vision involves three key phases: Empathize, Create, and Evangelize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>.

### 1. Empathize (Understand the Problem)
The first step is to deeply understand the customer and the problem being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. This means performing "understand work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>:

*   **Dogfooding and Catfooding:** Actively use your own product ("dogfooding") and competitor products ("catfooding") to build intuition and identify pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
*   **Leverage Research:** Use research to identify foundational problems that are a few cycles out, rather than just immediate needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. Product managers should also trust their gut and intuition, informed by their mental model of the customer and their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>.
*   **"Top 10 Things You Should Know" Document:** Create a living document that lists the top 10 known problems for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This document should be revised quarterly and can include qualitative, quantitative, and even technical debt problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
    *   **Involving Stakeholders:** During strategic planning, invite stakeholders (marketing, operations, content strategy, etc.) to contribute their "top 10 problems" using this template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. This helps gather a multifaceted view of problems and fosters buy-in as they feel heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
    *   **Strategic Sessions:** Dedicate time (e.g., three-day strategy sessions) to deeply explore these problems. The first day focuses on insights and "understand work," with product, engineering, design, and often data science leads participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.

### 2. Create (Define the Vision)
Once the problems are clearly understood, the next step is to create the vision. This involves defining what the world will look like if these problems are solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. Effective communication of the vision is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

Tactical ways to communicate the vision:
*   **"Once Upon a Time" Framework (Mad Libs Approach):** A simple storytelling structure for the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
    *   "Once Upon a Time, [problem/current state]..."
    *   "...and because of that, [consequence]..."
    *   "...and one day, [vision/big change]..."
    *   "...and as a result of that, [impact/new world state]..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>
*   **Future News Article:** Write a headline and subtitle (or even a full article) as if the vision has come to pass in a publication like TechCrunch or The New York Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This forces clarity and helps socialize the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   **Visualizations:** Create sketches, mocks, or even mock App Store screenshots of what the product would look like in the envisioned future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. While designers are helpful, product managers should not wait for a designer and can sketch it themselves to bring the narrative to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

### 3. Evangelize (Share and Gain Buy-In)
After creating the vision, it must be evangelized to ensure everyone is rowing in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>. This requires patience, as the process can take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

The evangelization process typically follows concentric circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>:
1.  **Core Team:** Ensure the immediate team understands and is bought into the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. This involves repeated presentations and sharing living documents with open comments, allowing for discussion and refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.
2.  **Stakeholders and Adjacent Teams:** Present the vision to these groups, including their managers. Their perspectives can highlight missing pieces or potential challenges, which helps refine the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. The fact that their initial problems were heard during the "Empathize" phase makes this easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
3.  **Leadership:** Go as high as possible with the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. Encourage leadership to amplify the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>.

This evangelization is for long-term, "Evergreen" visions (3-5 years out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. For shorter-term plans (next 6 months), simpler communication methods like a "tweet" or a mock App Store screenshot are sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>.

## Clarity and Conviction: The Core of Product Management
The "craft" of product management is defined by two key elements: [[Developing Conviction and Gaining BuyIn | Clarity and Conviction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

*   **Clarity:** Involves simplifying and making transparent the problem and the proposed solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. The "insights, strategy, big rocks" narrative structure helps achieve this by clearly defining "why we're doing what we're doing, how we're going to do it, and what we're going to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. This narrative should be a concise, typically two-page document, detailing insights, strategy (or approach), and the 3-5 big rocks (key deliverables) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.
*   **Conviction:** This is the feeling of what the world should be like, a belief in the right path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>. It's about picking a lane and committing to it, even if uncomfortable, and then gathering more certainty through research and discussion rather than avoiding difficult decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

## Building Team Culture for Alignment
The culture of a company significantly impacts how products are built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>. Similarly, every team has its own culture, which product managers and leaders are responsible for cultivating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

Key cultural elements that foster alignment and buy-in:
*   **Freedom of Responsibility:** Provide freedom, but expect responsibility. This means empowering individuals to own their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.
*   **Informed Captain:** Clearly designate an "informed captain" or "decider" for each decision. This person gathers all context and input but is empowered to make the final decision, preventing chaos and encouraging thoroughness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability as Strength:** Encourage an environment where people can be vulnerable and connect as humans, not just roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>. This builds trust and allows for tough feedback to be received constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>.
    *   **Being Loved, Not Just Liked:** Focus on extending oneself for the "spiritual growth" of oneself or others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This means having hard conversations, knowing that care has been genuinely demonstrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Personal Connection:** Learn about teammates beyond their role, such as their birthdays, work anniversaries, and career aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:35">[01:24:35]</a>. This fosters personal bonds and enhances [[importance_of_trust_and_collaboration_in_team_environments | trust building and impact focus in product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a>.
*   **Internal Collaboration:** Encourage teams to share their work (e.g., PRDs) internally before sharing with external partners. This allows for internal feedback and shaping, fostering collective ownership and improving the final output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>.

## Final Advice for Developing Vision and Alignment
To improve at creating vision and fostering alignment, focus on:
1.  **Visceral Problem Understanding:** Be able to clearly and crisply articulate the top 3-4 problems that keep you up at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. This list should be constantly evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.
2.  **Sketch Solutions:** Start sketching what the solution to these problems would look like, even if it's just on a Post-it note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>. This initial visualization helps solidify the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.
3.  **Practice:** Engage in "product management" before formally becoming a PM by analyzing favorite apps, identifying problems, and envisioning solutions. This builds product sense over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.

This tactical approach helps product managers move from vague ideas to concrete plans that can be clearly communicated and adopted across the organization.

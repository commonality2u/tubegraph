Product managers often find themselves overwhelmed and stressed due to an endless to-do list, struggling to make a significant dent in their workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. This often stems from treating all tasks equally, regardless of their potential impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>. To overcome this, product managers can leverage the LNO framework, which categorizes tasks based on their impact-to-effort ratio.

## The LNO Framework

The LNO framework classifies tasks into three types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>:

1.  **L-Tasks (Leverage Tasks)**: These tasks yield a significantly higher return than the effort invested, often 10x or 100x the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. For these, a product manager's "inner perfectionist" can shine, as the increased effort translates to disproportionately greater results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
2.  **N-Tasks (Neutral Tasks)**: For these tasks, the impact is roughly equivalent to or slightly more than the effort put in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
3.  **O-Tasks (Overhead Tasks)**: These tasks generate much less impact than the effort required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. An example of an O-task is an expense report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.

The key insight of the LNO framework is that not all tasks are created equal, and ambitious individuals often default to treating them as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>. By understanding and applying this distinction, product managers can spend less time on N-tasks and O-tasks, freeing up valuable time for L-tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.

It's important to note that the same type of activity can fall into different categories depending on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. For instance, filing a bug report or taking meeting notes can be an L-task, N-task, or O-task depending on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>.

## Identifying L-Tasks

Product managers often implicitly know what their L-tasks are because these are the tasks that bother them the most, often due to procrastination or not being addressed adequately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>. Common examples of procrastinated L-tasks include:

*   **Getting the strategy right**: Product managers often complain about not having time for strategy due to constant firefighting and [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | execution]] issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>. This procrastination often stems from a deep-seated fear of not being able to formulate a good strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **Writing detailed Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)** for difficult features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.
*   **Aligning two teams** where collaboration would create significant impact, but the effort is perceived as difficult or requires tough conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.

These are the "caves you fear" that contain the "treasure you seek" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>; where it's most difficult is often where the biggest opportunity lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>.

## Tactics for Prioritizing L-Tasks

To effectively tackle L-tasks and combat procrastination, two tactics can be highly effective:

1.  **Placebo Productivity**: Intentionally spend a couple of days before tackling an L-task by doing N-tasks and O-tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. This "tricks" the mind into feeling productive, making it easier to transition to the demanding L-task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:58">[00:51:58]</a>.
2.  **Change of Location**: Working from a different environment, such as a coffee shop or co-working space, can force a new level of focus and shift in mindset, helping to complete L-tasks efficiently and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

## Broader Application and Planning

The LNO framework also applies to broader planning for teams and organizations, specifically when considering [[strategies_for_simplifying_and_prioritizing_tasks_as_a_pm | prioritization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>. In high-leverage roles, the focus should shift from simply pursuing work with a positive Return on Investment (ROI) to minimizing opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>.

*   **ROI Mindset**: Focusing on ROI often leads to prioritizing "quick wins" or "low-hanging fruit" because they take less time (decreasing the denominator in the ROI formula) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. While not inherently bad, this approach can fill up the plate with minor gains, causing the team to miss larger, transformative opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Cost Mindset**: This involves asking: "Is this the *best* use of my time?" rather than just "Is this a *good* use of my time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. This subtle yet profound shift encourages tackling ambiguous but potentially game-changing projects that might be ignored if only a positive ROI is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

Leaders can facilitate this shift by providing clear guidance during planning, allocating percentages of time to different types of activities, similar to Google's classic 70/20/10 rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>. For example, a leader might suggest allocating 60% of time to incremental features (high ROI), 30% to big new initiatives (minimizing opportunity cost), and 10% to stability and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. This empowers teams to pursue significant, long-term opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.

By consciously [[decision_making_in_product_management | deciding]] to focus on L-tasks and thinking in terms of minimizing opportunity cost rather than just maximizing ROI, product managers can significantly increase their [[balancing_output_and_impact_in_product_management_roles | impact]] and [[building_high_agency_in_product_management_roles | agency]], leading to more meaningful contributions and reduced stress.

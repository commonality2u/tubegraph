Toby views his role as a builder, with his primary energy source being dissatisfaction with the status quo, and a desire to build products that lead to progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He believes that today is the dystopia of the future, emphasizing the need to build products that drive progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The "Toby Tornado" and Direct Feedback

The "[[Empowering product teams and the concept of context over control | Toby Tornado]]" refers to a rapid process of change management, conversation, or conflict resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. If a project isn't working, Toby will have a conversation, and if the reasoning behind it isn't "steel-manned," he updates his understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This can lead to projects being stopped, with the team becoming founders of the next version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This approach compresses time to prevent wasting effort on initiatives that won't succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, as not stopping such projects is seen as an abdication of CEO and founder responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Direct and sometimes "hard to hear" feedback is a means to maximize an individual's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Toby believes that no one is close to their maximum potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, and constantly reminding people of their own potential is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. He states that he is often right about people's potential more than they are themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Holding people to a high standard often enables them to achieve things they never imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, and his product's mission is to help people be more successful than they thought they could be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Unquantifiable Factors in Performance

Toby suggests that the most powerful, unquantifiable things in business are fun and delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. If people are having more fun, even if metrics are pointing down, he believes that metrics will eventually start to go up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. This approach contrasts with the aesthetic of sophisticated business people who focus on metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. Optimism often sounds naive, while pessimism sounds sophisticated, but the "alpha" in the world is often found in things that are unobvious but true, or things people dismiss as naive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

Shopify operates without specific KPIs or OKRs in the traditional sense, but they are "extremely data-informed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. They have invested heavily in systems that provide real-time data, allowing them to "dig into basically every constituent part that makes up the cohort that just got formed 15 minutes ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. The company aims not to "overfit" for the quantifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. The highly quantifiable aspects of a product represent only about 20% of its potential value, leaving 80% in unquantifiable areas like taste, quality, passion, and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

### Goodhart's Law and Overfitting
The concept of "overfitting" in machine learning, where a model learns to cheat on a benchmark, applies to business through Goodhart's Law: "Any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a good metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. School systems, for example, often optimize for "marks" rather than maintaining curiosity, which can lead to "overfitting" or "cheating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

## Thinking from First Principles

Toby approaches problems by thinking from first principles, which he sees as deriving solutions from the "atomic building blocks" or "physics" of a problem, rather than relying on existing solutions that are path-dependent and based on past compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. He emphasizes the need to understand the power and composability of all currently available building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. It's crucial to "rerun" decisions and foundational assumptions periodically, as changes in core conditions (like "are people allowed to leave their house?") can invalidate entire decision trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

*   **Be in the details:** Toby believes that understanding the "atomic building blocks" of computers and software is essential for making informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. He actively codes and is involved in the engineering details, finding it his "happy place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>.
*   **Avoid sunk cost fallacy:** Businesses should inoculate themselves from the sunk cost fallacy to see better solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. This means being willing to stop projects, even if effort has already been invested, if it's determined they won't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.
*   **Challenge assumptions:** Toby becomes "extremely suspicious" of pitches that aim to do "a good version of the same thing everyone else does" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. He believes that if you want to do something world-class, you cannot do it like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

### Disagreement and Courage
Toby actively encourages disagreement, finding it valuable because it requires courage and builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. When someone disagrees, he immediately stops to understand the "unstated foundational assumptions" that lead to the divergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. He sometimes plays "devil's advocate" to prompt deeper arguments for decisions, especially if a proposal is predictable or unsurprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>. This process of rigorous debate builds trust and improves collective decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.

## Long-Term Vision and the Infinite Game

Toby emphasizes a "100-year vision" for Shopify, focusing on the company's mission rather than short-term software projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. This long-term focus guides decision-making, ensuring actions are "most long-term valuable" for the company's pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>.

*   **Positional vs. Tactical Game:** In business, as in chess, there's a positional game (long-term strategic advantage, like building trust and expanding influence) and a tactical game (short-term gains, like conversion rate optimizations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. While tactics are necessary to avoid failure, the "sum total of all the value" is held in the positional game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>. The priority is to avoid dying (short-term survival) and then to focus on the positional game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>.
*   **Positive-Sum Games:** Playing "positive-sum games" with customers is the ultimate growth hack over a long enough timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. This means being on the same side of the table as customers, supporting their success rather than extracting maximum value in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.

## Enabling Entrepreneurship

Shopify's mission is to make entrepreneurship more common, by making it easier to start new online businesses than in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. They avoid being "written into the story" and instead focus on "pushing from behind" to empower entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>.

A key insight is that every time a complex process is made simpler, more businesses are created on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. Software should empower people, not make them feel dumb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Simplifying complexities like taxes, payments, or fraud, and making them automatic, directly leads to more entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>. This reduction of complexity lowers the amount of courage needed for an entrepreneur to launch a business, which is a significant barrier given societal discouragement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>.

## Personal Growth and "Talent Stacks"

Toby emphasizes that individuals are "products" engaging in their own entrepreneurship, essentially "Talent as a Service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. Career success is not primarily about mentors or promotions, but about becoming "too good to ignore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:37">[01:35:37]</a>.

He encourages individuals to focus on their unique talents and curiosity, leading to opportunities by building a "talent stack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Finding a unique intersection of three different things and excelling in that niche is often more effective than trying to compete in broad, popular areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:54">[01:32:54]</a>.

## Role of Product Leaders

Product leaders have a crucial role in ensuring their teams "give a shit" about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:32">[01:37:32]</a>. It's impossible to make great products if the creators don't care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:27">[01:37:27]</a>. This requires the product leader to be "exothermically infectious" with their own care for the product, which can lead to a 10x better product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. They must also "look around corners" and understand the product better than anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>. This mindset is akin to "founder mode," which involves pumping heat into systems and fostering innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:56">[01:39:56]</a>.

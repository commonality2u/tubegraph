Naomi Gleit, Head of Product at Meta and employee number 29 at Facebook (now Meta), has been with the company for almost 20 years, seeing it scale from 30 employees to a $1.5 trillion business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. She was central to foundational products, including the early growth team and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## The Legendary Growth Team

The Facebook growth team is considered legendary, possibly the first real growth team in tech, developing core growth levers and techniques still used by companies today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

### Focus on Retention over Acquisition

Initially, the growth team focused heavily on acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. However, using a "growth accounting" framework, they realized that churn and resurrection rates were much larger than new user acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. This implied that retention was their biggest lever for net growth, leading them to shift their focus towards engagement and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. This fundamental insight, common knowledge today, was a significant realization at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

### The "Seven Friends in 10 Days" Metric

A well-known activation metric for Facebook's growth team was "seven friends in 10 days" (or "10 friends in 14 days") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. This metric represented the point on the retention curve where a user's likelihood of being retained significantly increased, as they had experienced the core value of Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. The importance was less about the exact numbers and more about having **extreme clarity** around a shared goal to optimize towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

## Core Growth Frameworks and Principles

### 1. Data-Driven and Product-Driven Approach

The growth team pioneered integrating a data-driven and product-driven approach into what was historically a business function (marketing and communications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. They realized the product itself was the biggest lever for growth, leading to product and engineering teams optimizing flows like registration, invitations, and new user onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.

### 2. "Understand, Identify, Execute"

This framework, a key "Naomism," emerged in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.
*   **Understand:** In January 2009, the growth team paused other roadmap items to focus solely on data instrumentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. This involved instrumenting every step of the registration and new user onboarding flows to identify drop-off points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **Identify:** With the data, they could identify key opportunities for growth, such as increasing friending in the new user experience or addressing a 20% drop-off at the email confirmation step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
*   **Execute:** They would then build products to address these identified opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

This approach was later expanded to other areas like social impact, where instead of a traditional Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) wing, they built a product to enable community-based fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. Similarly, for translations, instead of hiring professional translators, they built a product that allowed the community to make in-line translations, leading to support for over 100 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

### 3. Removing Barriers (Macro and Micro)

Facebook's growth efforts, especially from the growth team, were often about removing barriers to usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>.
*   **Macro Barriers:** These were large-scale barriers. Early examples include:
    *   Expanding beyond college students to high school students, then work networks, and eventually to anyone with an email address (open registration in 2006) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
    *   Addressing the lack of smartphone access by building a rich experience for feature phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.
    *   Initiatives like internet.org aimed to remove barriers to internet access and data plan affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.
*   **Micro Barriers:** These involved optimizing flows to remove friction. An elegant example was addressing the 20% drop-off from users not confirming their email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. Instead of solely relying on the confirmation email, they allowed unconfirmed accounts to receive notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. If a user clicked on *any* notification, it would count as an account confirmation, as it proved email ownership, thus removing a micro-barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.

### 4. Importance of Onboarding

When Facebook expanded beyond college students, a new user onboarding experience became crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Early college users understood the product through osmosis, but as it opened up to a wider audience, a guided experience was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. This onboarding focused on essential steps like uploading a profile picture to be found and finding friends, which was critical for achieving the activation metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. These core principles of enabling connections remain relevant in onboarding processes today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## Reflecting on Growth Success

Naomi Gleit acknowledges that while the growth team put in significant effort, a large part of Facebook's success was due to strong product-market fit and high user demand from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>. The growth team primarily focused on optimizing existing demand rather than creating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

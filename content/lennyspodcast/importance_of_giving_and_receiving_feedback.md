Giving and receiving feedback is a crucial aspect of professional and personal growth, leading to stronger relationships and improved performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. According to Kim Scott, author of "Radical Candor," effective feedback fosters better work environments and personal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## What is Radical Candor?

Radical Candor is achieved when you **care personally** and **challenge directly** at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This framework is often best understood by examining its antitheses:

*   **Obnoxious Aggression** occurs when you challenge directly but fail to care personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This approach is inefficient because it puts the recipient into a "fight or flight" mode, preventing them from truly hearing the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Ruinous Empathy** happens when you care personally but fail to challenge directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This is the most common mistake people make, often due to a desire to be "nice" or avoid hurting feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. It creates false harmony that ultimately leads to worse outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
*   **Manipulative Insincerity** is the worst quadrant, where there's neither personal care nor direct challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This is often a self-protective behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

Most people (around 90%) tend to fall into the "ruinous empathy" bucket, making mistakes by not delivering candid feedback when it's needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Benefits of Effective Feedback

Developing the skill of radical candor has significant positive impacts:
*   **Improved Relationships and Work Quality** [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | Developing leadership skills and understanding feedback]]: It helps build stronger interpersonal connections and leads to higher quality work outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Increased Success and Happiness**: Individuals and teams are more successful and feel greater satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Retention of Top Performers**: Failing to give direct feedback can lead to the loss of your best team members, as they become frustrated by underperformance going unaddressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **"Relationship Hygiene"**: Providing timely feedback is like "brushing and flossing" for relationships, preventing larger problems down the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. An "ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

### Kim Scott's Personal Story

Kim Scott shares an impactful experience early in her career at Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. After a presentation, her boss told her she said "um" a lot and offered a speech coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. When Kim brushed it off, her boss directly stated, "When you say 'um' every third word it makes you sound stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This direct feedback, though harsh-sounding, was the "kindest thing" her boss could have done because it was delivered with genuine care and helped Kim improve a significant career impediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### The Story of Bob

Kim Scott also recounts her failure with an employee named Bob, illustrating the pitfalls of ruinous empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. Bob was well-liked but consistently produced sloppy work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. Instead of giving direct feedback, Kim would offer vague, "nice" comments like, "Bob, this is such a great start, you're so awesome... maybe you can make it just a little bit better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This went on for 10 months, driven by Kim's desire to be liked and fear of hurting Bob's feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. Ultimately, Kim had to fire Bob, who then asked, "Why didn't anyone tell me? I thought you all cared about me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. This experience highlighted how ruinous empathy can be more painful and damaging in the long run than direct criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.

## Giving Feedback

When providing feedback, remember the "HIPCORE" framework, focusing on how to give feedback constructively.
*   **Humble**: Approach the conversation as a dialogue, not a monologue. "Cander" implies your understanding of the situation, while also being open to the other person's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. You might be wrong, and that's okay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Helpful**: State your intention to be helpful; you're giving feedback to support their growth, not to dominate or punish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Immediately**: Deliver feedback as soon as possible. Delaying often means you'll never say it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
*   **Personally/Synchronously**: In-person or synchronous communication (like a phone call, preferred over video) allows you to gauge how the feedback is landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Avoid email or text for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **Private (for criticism), Public (for praise)**: Criticize in private to avoid shaming, and praise in public to highlight good examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Not about personality**: Focus on specific behaviors, not character traits. Use the "CORE" structure:
    *   **Context**: Where and when it happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
    *   **Observation**: What you observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.
    *   **Result**: The impact of the behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.
    *   **Next Step**: What action should be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

    For example, with the "um" story: "In the meeting (context), when you said 'um' every third word (observation), it made you sound stupid (result). Go to the speech coach (next step)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

*   **Overcoming People-Pleasing** [[overcoming_fear_of_giving_candid_feedback | Overcoming fear of giving candid feedback]]:
    *   Recognize that your job is to care about others, not to be liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
    *   Focus on doing the right thing for people, which often means providing necessary feedback for their growth, even if it feels uncomfortable in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
    *   It's "unkind in the long run" not to tell someone when they're making a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
    *   Connect feedback to their career aspirations to show you care about their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>.

## Receiving Feedback

Actively soliciting and receiving feedback is the first and most important step to improving relationships and fostering a candid culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. This applies to managers, employees, and even personal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.

1.  **Ask the Right Question** [[techniques_for_effective_feedback_and_communication | Techniques for effective feedback and communication]]:
    *   Avoid generic questions like "Do you have any feedback for me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
    *   Ask questions that sound authentic to you and elicit specific responses, like "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, or "Tell me why I'm wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.
    *   Managers should solicit feedback weekly from direct reports, cross-functional peers, and their own boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.
    *   As an employee, it's also important to solicit feedback from your boss regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.
2.  **Embrace the Discomfort (Count to Six)** [[effective_feedback_and_listening_strategies | Effective feedback and listening strategies]]:
    *   After asking, close your mouth and count to six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. This prolonged silence often prompts the other person to share something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
    *   Don't accept "no, everything's fine" as an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. If they're uncomfortable, tell them you're not perfect and want them to think of something for the next meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
3.  **Listen to Understand, Not to Respond** [[the_art_and_importance_of_listening_for_leaders | The art and importance of listening for leaders]]:
    *   Manage your natural defensive reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
    *   Ask follow-up questions to ensure you truly understand their point, rather than jumping to conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
4.  **Reward the Candor**:
    *   If you agree with the feedback, fix the problem and make your listening "tangible" by visibly acting on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.
    *   Ask for follow-up feedback: "Did I overcorrect or undercorrect?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
    *   If you disagree, acknowledge the part you agree with (even 5-10%), then state you need to think about the rest and will get back to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. Always follow up with a respectful explanation of your disagreement; unspoken disagreement harms relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. Many strong professional relationships begin with respectful disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

## Addressing Culture and Leadership Styles

Changing a company culture that isn't welcoming to direct feedback requires starting with soliciting criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>. For leaders who seem to embody "obnoxious aggression," it's vital to explain the *inefficiency* of their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. When they realize their behavior hinders their own success and results, they are more likely to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>. Sharing personal stories of your own mistakes can help them gain self-awareness without feeling judged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

It's a "false dichotomy" to believe that success requires being a "total jerk" or being "nice but incompetent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>. Radical Candor offers a third way: being highly effective without hurting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.

## Radical Respect

Kim Scott's upcoming book, "Radical Respect," serves as a prequel to "Radical Candor," emphasizing that respect for others is foundational to caring and challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. The book addresses how to combat bias, prejudice, and bullying, and how to become an "upstander" in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>. It is relevant for leaders, those harmed by bias, colleagues, and anyone who might inadvertently be part of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

## Takeaway

To start building the "muscle" of radical candor, write down your "go-to" question for soliciting feedback, practice it, and schedule a five-minute slot in your calendar to ask someone that question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.

Remember: "It's not mean, it's clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:19">[01:22:19]</a>. You do not have to choose between being successful and being a jerk; you can be a successful, kind person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.

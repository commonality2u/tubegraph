Nubank, a prominent fintech company, envisions a future for financial services that is fundamentally different from traditional banking, heavily leveraging [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] and automation to create personalized and optimized experiences for customers globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>.

## Vision for AI-Powered Banking

The core of Nubank's vision for the future of financial services is to democratize access to sophisticated financial guidance, akin to having a personal banker available to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This contrasts with the current reality where only a small percentage of the world's population, typically those with significant wealth, have access to such personalized services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. The goal is to build an experience that is better than what even the wealthiest currently receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.

### Personalized Financial Guidance

A key principle is the idea of holistic banking, providing full solutions across an individual's financial life, including spending, saving, investing, borrowing, and protecting assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] is seen as a "turbo boost" for these tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. The vision is for a system that acts like a "personal banker" who can suggest smart financial moves at different life stages, such as after having a child, getting married, buying a house, or remodeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>. This intelligent guidance would be accessible even to customers who are not highly sophisticated in financial education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>.

### Automation and Optimization

Nubank's approach aims to address the reality that "customers everywhere around the world live harshly unoptimized financial lives," regardless of income, geography, or life stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>. This includes simplifying complex tasks such as paying bills across different payment rails in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

The company believes in leveraging "social mechanics" and "self-driving automation" within financial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. This means:
*   **Automating routine tasks** such as remembering to pay bills every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>.
*   **Automating savings goals** like saving for a child's university education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.
*   **Better organizing life goals** which are currently difficult to manage, often leading to cumbersome workarounds like opening multiple bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

These problems are seen as solvable and capable of being automated, bringing insights to customers through [[ai_and_software_development | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>.

## Developing [[ai_product_development_and_challenges | AI-Native Products]]

Nubank utilizes standard [[ai_product_development_and_challenges | AI]] tools, including ring-fenced versions of ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. The initial focus for [[role_of_ai_in_product_teams | AI]] integration is on improving customer experience and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>.

### Operationalizing AI

The ambition extends beyond incremental improvements to building truly [[ai_product_development_and_challenges | AI-native products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>. This involves understanding what an [[ai_product_development_and_challenges | AI-native mindset]] means for financial services, questioning how product design would change if these powerful tools existed from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. This requires analysis rather than just analogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.

The company is working on the next phase of its products, which includes moving beyond traditional financial services, having already launched an e-commerce marketplace within their app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>. They believe the company that reinvents banking globally can come from Latin America, specifically cities like São Paulo, Mexico City, or Bogotá, challenging the traditional dominance of San Francisco, New York, or London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>. They are committed to building what they believe is the first global bank on a single codebase, drawing from Google's experience with global product launches while adapting to the local regulations and higher stakes of fintech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.

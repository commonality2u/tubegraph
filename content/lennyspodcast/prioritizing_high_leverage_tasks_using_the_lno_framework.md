The LNO framework offers a powerful way for product managers and other high-leverage professionals to categorize and prioritize their work, ensuring they focus their efforts where they yield the greatest returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. This approach helps combat feelings of overwhelm and stress that often arise from endless to-do lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

## Understanding the LNO Framework

The LNO framework classifies tasks into three categories based on their leverage:

### L (Leverage) Tasks
These are tasks where a small amount of effort can yield a 10x or 100x return in terms of impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. They represent the highest potential for growth and positive outcomes for the product or organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>.

### N (Neutral) Tasks
For neutral tasks, the return on effort is roughly proportional to the input, or slightly more, e.g., 1x effort yields 1.1x impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. These are necessary tasks that keep things running but don't offer exponential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.

### O (Overhead) Tasks
Overhead tasks yield significantly less impact than the effort put into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. These are often administrative or low-value activities that consume time without contributing much to core objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.

## The Problem of Treating All Tasks Equally

Many ambitious and perfectionist individuals, including product managers, implicitly treat all types of tasks the same way, leading to stress and inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>. Before discovering the LNO framework, Shreyas Doshi experienced constant overwhelm at Google, feeling highly dissatisfied because his to-do list was endless and he couldn't make a significant dent in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>.

The key insight is that the same type of activity can fall into different categories (L, N, or O) depending on the specific situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.
*   **Filing a bug report**: Can be a high-leverage task requiring a very detailed report, or an overhead task with minimal detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.
*   **Taking notes**: Can be a high-leverage task (e.g., for a contentious CEO product review where clarity is paramount) requiring perfection, or an overhead task (e.g., for standard meetings where only action items matter) that can be sent immediately without polish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>.

## Prioritizing for Leverage

To maximize impact, product managers should:
1.  **Identify L-tasks**: Recognize the few tasks that offer disproportionate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.
2.  **Focus on L-tasks**: Tackle these when feeling most productive and energetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. Allow your inner perfectionist to shine here, as the return on effort is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
3.  **Minimize time on N and O-tasks**: Redirect time from neutral and overhead tasks to free up capacity for high-leverage activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. For overhead tasks like expense reports, avoid over-investing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>.

> "Many people who are ambitious or are perfectionists like myself they by default treat each of these types of tasks the same way and therein lies the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>

### Why L-tasks are often Procrastinated

L-tasks are frequently procrastinated because:
1.  **Awareness of Impact**: People know these are significant tasks with real impact, which can be daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
2.  **Requires Dedicated Attention**: They demand focused, uninterrupted time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.
3.  **Fear of Inadequacy**: A deep-seated fear that one might not be able to formulate a good strategy or solution often leads to procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. "Time" becomes a convenient excuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>.
    *   Examples of procrastinated L-tasks include: getting strategy right, writing a PRD for a difficult feature, or aligning two teams for significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.

### Tactics for Tackling L-Tasks

[!TIP] To overcome procrastination and effectively tackle L-tasks:
1.  **Placebo Productivity**: In the days leading up to an L-task, intentionally fill your schedule with N and O tasks. This "tricks" the mind into feeling productive, making it easier to transition to the demanding L-task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.
2.  **Change of Location**: Work from a different environment than usual (e.g., a coffee shop, co-working space). This change of place forces focus and shifts mindset, helping to complete the L-task quickly and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

## Connecting to Broader Product Concepts

The LNO framework is closely related to other critical aspects of product management:

### [[balancing_impact_execution_and_optics_in_product_management | Impact, Execution, and Optics]]
The framework helps understand why different stakeholders prioritize different levels of work. A CEO might focus on impact, while a PM might default to execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. The LNO framework allows for a more objective conversation about what level of work is most important given the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. For example, early-stage teams might prioritize execution to validate hypotheses, while a platform team facing availability issues might need to focus on [[balancing_impact_execution_and_optics_in_product_management | optics]] to communicate effectively with dependent teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

### [[Reframing prioritization by focusing on minimizing opportunity cost | Minimizing Opportunity Cost]]
In high-leverage roles, there are hundreds of tasks that could provide a positive Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. However, chasing positive ROI often leads to prioritizing quick wins or low-hanging fruit (decreasing the denominator in the ROI formula), causing teams to miss out on larger, transformative opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.

Instead, the focus should be on minimizing [[Reframing prioritization by focusing on minimizing opportunity cost | opportunity cost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. This means identifying the optimal options and prioritizing them, even if they require more work and are initially ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>. This mental shift from "is this a good use of my time?" to "is this the best use of my time?" helps identify the true L-tasks that can significantly change business trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>.

[!TIP] Leaders can enable teams to focus on minimizing opportunity cost by providing clear guidance on time allocation, such as Google's classic 70/20/10 rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>. For example, allocating 60% of time to incrementals (high ROI), 30% to big new initiatives (high leverage, minimizing opportunity cost), and 10% to stability and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>. This structure provides the necessary space and permission for teams to pursue impactful, less obvious opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.

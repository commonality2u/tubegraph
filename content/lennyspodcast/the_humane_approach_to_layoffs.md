Leading a company requires making difficult decisions, and one of the most challenging is conducting layoffs. While the act of reducing workforce might seem impersonal, the way it's handled can significantly impact not only those leaving but also the morale and future performance of the remaining team [00:00:00, 00:22:11]. According to Matt Mashari, an executive coach who has advised numerous CEOs through such processes, the ability to fire people humanely is one of the most important skills a leader can develop [00:23:44 - 00:23:51].

## The Crucial Difference: Personal vs. Impersonal Delivery

The biggest marker differentiating a botched layoff from a successful one lies in how the news is delivered [00:00:00 - 00:00:05, 00:47:11 - 00:47:18].

*   **Successful Layoff:** The individual hears the news from their manager in a one-on-one conversation [00:00:13 - 00:00:17, 00:47:25 - 00:47:29]. This approach makes the situation manageable [00:00:21, 00:47:33].
*   **Botched Layoff:** The individual learns they no longer have a job via email, group chat, or any situation where they are hearing it along with others [00:00:23 - 00:00:34, 00:47:34 - 00:47:46]. This impersonal delivery is "terrible" and often leads to anger, public outcry on social media, or engagement with media [00:00:37 - 00:00:46, 00:47:48 - 00:47:58]. It feels dehumanizing and like a lack of courtesy [00:00:49 - 00:00:56, 00:48:00 - 00:48:07].

Furthermore, an impersonal delivery method, like an email or group announcement, prevents the person from expressing their emotions, which is crucial for processing the news [00:00:57 - 00:01:03, 00:48:07 - 00:48:15].

## Preparing for and Delivering the Difficult Conversation

Managers often struggle with layoffs because they perceive they are hurting the person being let go [00:24:03 - 00:24:08, 00:27:27 - 00:27:31]. However, a framework shared by We Dang of Clipboard Health suggests separating the decision from the implementation [00:24:29 - 00:24:34]:

*   **The Decision:** Focus on what the customer or business needs. Customers generally want the best employees, meaning those not performing effectively should not be there [00:24:40 - 00:24:51].
*   **The Implementation:** This is where humanity comes in. Minimize harm to all stakeholders (the employee, the manager, and the rest of the team) [00:24:52 - 00:25:06].

### The Conversation Script

Matt Mashari provides a tactical script for delivering layoff news in a humane way, emphasizing [[using_empathy_as_a_communication_strategy | empathy]] and transparency:

1.  **Prepare the Person for Difficulty:** Start by stating, "This is going to be a difficult conversation. I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself. You are not going to enjoy this" [00:30:00 - 00:30:11, 00:49:47 - 00:49:51]. This pre-warning helps prevent the amygdala from being triggered by surprise, allowing the person to process emotions more calmly [00:30:16 - 00:30:31].
2.  **Deliver the News:** Clearly state, "I'm letting you go," and provide the reason [00:30:51 - 00:30:53, 00:49:51 - 00:49:53].
3.  **Encourage Emotional Release:** Acknowledge the likely emotions: "My guess is you're feeling a lot of anger right now, fear, sadness. Is that true? And if so, would you be willing to share with me what you're feeling and what you're thinking?" [00:31:09 - 00:31:21, 00:49:53 - 00:50:00].
4.  **Actively Listen:** Allow them to express their feelings without interruption, making them feel heard. This shows you're not avoiding their pain and are willing to sit with them through it [00:31:23 - 00:31:45].

> [!INFO] Making People Feel Heard
> To ensure someone feels truly heard, repeat their thoughts and feelings back to them, even if they are stronger than what was verbally expressed. For example, "I think what I'm hearing you say is you're pissed off and you're thinking screw you Matt, how dare you..." [00:33:53 - 00:34:04]. This validates their internal experience, even if they soften their language. Then, explain your perspective honestly [00:34:11 - 00:34:43].

## Becoming an "Agent" for the Departed

After the initial conversation, the critical step in humane layoffs is actively helping the person find their next opportunity [00:20:41 - 00:20:47, 00:26:22 - 00:26:30].

> [!NOTE] Active Support vs. Passive Reference
> This means becoming their "agent," akin to a talent agent, actively reaching out to your network to connect them with potential employers [00:26:30 - 00:26:42]. Simply offering a reference is passive and not sufficient [00:26:44 - 00:26:47]. This process typically takes only one to two hours of your time [00:26:52 - 00:26:54].

Even if the person was a "bad performer," Matt Mashari believes they are good at something. The manager's role is to help them identify their passions and skills, then recommend them for roles that truly need what they offer [00:27:04 - 00:27:22].

## Navigating Large-Scale Layoffs

When a company undergoes a large-scale layoff, such as during economic downturns, the principles of humane delivery still apply, scaled across the organization [00:45:55 - 00:46:16].

### Strategic Planning for Mass Layoffs

1.  **Define the Scope:** The leadership team (inner circle) determines the total cost reduction needed [00:48:22 - 00:48:31]. It's better to specify a dollar amount rather than a number of people, as focusing on people might lead to letting go of the cheapest or most junior employees, who are often doing critical work [00:48:47 - 00:49:00].
2.  **Empower Managers:** Instead of dictating who to lay off, managers should be given a budget reduction goal and choose who to let go within their teams [00:49:09 - 00:49:15, 00:49:23 - 00:49:26]. This helps prevent resentment and ensures the best people are retained [00:49:17 - 00:49:23]. This decision-making phase should be swift, ideally 48 hours [00:49:26 - 00:49:28].
3.  **Cut Deep, Cut Once:** It is crucial to cut deeply enough to avoid multiple rounds of layoffs [00:50:58 - 00:51:00]. Repeated layoffs (trauma one, trauma two, trauma three) create "PTSD" in an organization, leading to persistent fear and instability among the remaining team [01:06:03 - 01:06:10]. A single, decisive cut allows the company to confidently tell the "stay team" that their jobs are safe and they are the core team moving forward [00:50:43 - 00:50:56].

### The Implementation Day

On the day of the layoff:

1.  **Manager One-on-Ones:** Managers schedule back-to-back 15-minute one-on-one meetings to deliver the news using the humane conversation script [00:49:34 - 00:50:00]. In these meetings, managers should also schedule a follow-up hour for the next day to begin the "agent" support [00:50:00 - 00:50:10].
2.  **All-Hands for Remaining Team:** In the afternoon, hold an all-hands meeting for the "stay team" [00:51:14 - 00:51:19]. The CEO or leader informs them about what occurred and addresses their concerns, which typically revolve around fear, job security, fairness, and the company's future [00:51:22 - 00:51:38].

### Supporting the "Stay Team"

After the initial announcement, the emotional impact on the remaining team must be addressed [00:51:24 - 00:51:28].

1.  **Individual Manager One-on-Ones:** Each manager must hold a one-hour one-on-one meeting with *every* person on their "stay team" [00:51:34 - 00:51:39].
2.  **Focus on Feelings and Thoughts:** The sole purpose of these meetings is for the manager to ask, "I'd like to know your thoughts and feelings," and then actively listen, making the employee feel heard [00:51:43 - 00:51:50, 00:51:50 - 00:52:09]. This process doesn't eliminate emotion entirely, but it reduces it significantly (by about 25%), which is enough to prevent rash decisions like quitting or spreading negativity [00:52:11 - 00:52:31].

## Benefits of Humane Layoffs

While difficult, executed humanely, layoffs can lead to surprising positive outcomes for the company:

*   **Improved Performance:** Companies that implemented layoffs, even poorly, observed improved performance within two months [00:53:52 - 00:54:07]. Companies that handled them humanely saw improvements in as little as two weeks [00:51:20 - 00:51:24].
*   **Increased Productivity:** Paradoxically, with fewer people, organizations often operate better, putting out more features and code, and seeing increases in metrics like NPS [00:21:35 - 00:21:42, 00:45:17 - 00:45:37].
*   **Reduced Overhead and Friction:** Every additional person in an organization causes increased overhead, leading to geometrically increasing friction in information flow and potential morale problems if people don't feel heard [00:21:50 - 00:22:17]. Staying lean, like companies such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and Notion, are considered true success stories [00:22:38 - 00:22:50].
*   **Morale Boost:** By addressing emotions and transparently communicating, the morale of the "stay team" recovers faster, leading to a more engaged and higher-performing workforce [00:52:31 - 00:52:40].

Matt Mashari points out that most successful founders struggle with fear, which often gives bad advice [00:08:08 - 00:08:10, 00:09:02 - 00:09:04]. Layoffs are no exception. The fear of hurting others or of negative backlash often prevents leaders from making necessary, though difficult, decisions [00:08:38 - 00:08:50]. By understanding that acting against fear, when dealing with ego-based fears (not physical danger), can lead to positive outcomes (e.g., increased trust from investors by being transparent about problems [00:11:01 - 00:11:41]), leaders can approach layoffs with a more clear-headed and compassionate strategy.

Effective [[customer_engagement_and_product_development | stakeholder engagement]] is crucial in product planning, ensuring alignment and success. Product leaders like Ab Atod emphasize that this process involves deeply understanding problems, crafting a compelling vision, and consistently communicating it across different levels of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

## Key Principles for Engagement

The "craft of product management" is defined by two core principles: Clarity and Conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
*   **Clarity** involves defining transparency and simplicity of understanding, removing all polluting elements to reveal the core truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.
*   **Conviction** is a strong feeling about what the world should be, not necessarily certainty, but a robust sense of what is right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>.

Bringing these two elements together helps guide decision-making and [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | strategy execution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

## The Three-Phase Approach to Vision and Strategy

A three-phase framework can be used to develop and communicate a product vision effectively, heavily relying on [[customer_engagement_and_product_development | stakeholder engagement]] throughout:

1.  **Empathize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>
2.  **Create** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>
3.  **Evangelize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>

### 1. Empathize: Understanding the Problem and Customer

This phase focuses on gaining a deep understanding of customer problems and needs. It involves:

*   **Dogfooding and Catfooding:** Actively using one's own product ("dogfooding") and competitor products ("catfooding") to build intuition and expose oneself to good product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Research:** Using user research to update the mental model of the customer and their problems, rather than just dictating what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.
*   **The "Top 10 Things You Should Know" Document:** A living document where product managers and their teams list the 10 most critical problems with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. These problems can be qualitative, quantitative, or even technical debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. This document is periodically revised and updated, ensuring that core problems are universally understood across product, engineering, and design teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

    > [!TIP]
    > To involve external stakeholders in this process, provide them with the "Top 10 Things You Should Know" template and ask them to stack-rank their perceived problems. This puts the work on them to provide specific, prioritized input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. This fosters buy-in as they feel heard and understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

### 2. Create: Developing the Vision

The "create" phase involves defining what the world looks like if the identified problems are solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Key elements of a good vision include:

*   **Lofty but Realistic:** It should be inspiring and exciting, yet attainable and within reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Vacuum from Current Limitations:** The vision should initially be free from today's technical or resource limitations, allowing for future possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.
*   **Grounded in a Potent Problem:** It must address a clear and significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Various methods can be used to concretely articulate the vision:

*   **Mad Libs Framework (Once Upon a Time):** A simple storytelling structure:
    *   Once Upon a Time (state of the world) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>
    *   (the problem) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>
    *   And because of that (consequence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>
    *   Then one day (the big change/solution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>
    *   And as a result (the new state of the world/impact) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>
*   **"Working Backwards" - News Article:** Write a future news article (e.g., TechCrunch, New York Times) with the headline and subtitle that would announce the vision's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This forces clarity on the core impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   **Visualization/Mock-ups:** Sketch or mock up what the product looks like in the future. This can be as simple as hand-drawn sketches or mock-ups of app store screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Designers can enhance these, but even low-fidelity drawings help tell the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A vision is distinct from a mission. The mission is the purpose ("why you exist"), while the vision is the detailed picture of the future state ("what it looks like when you get there") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Visions should be evergreen, lasting at least 3-5 years, with micro-visions for shorter time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

### 3. Evangelize: Communicating the Vision

Evangelizing the vision involves communicating it effectively across concentric circles of influence:

1.  **Core Team:** The vision must first be understood and bought into by the immediate team (PMs, engineers, designers) who will build the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Regular presentations and open documents with comments (not just view-only) allow for discussion and polishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.
2.  **Stakeholders:** Next, the vision is shared with key internal stakeholders and their teams, including marketing, operations, support, and adjacent product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. This phase is crucial for addressing concerns and gaining buy-in, as these teams play a part in the product's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.
3.  **Leadership:** Finally, the vision is presented to leadership, aiming as high as possible in the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. Leaders can then amplify the story, which also helps in hiring and internal alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> When evangelizing, focus on the "narrative" â€“ the story of why the product exists, the problem it solves, and the strategy to solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. This narrative should be concise (e.g., a two-page document) and include the "big rocks" (3-5 core initiatives) that will deliver the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. This narrative framework is distinct from the [[developing_and_communicating_a_product_vision | vision]] itself, which is the picture of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.

## Company Culture's Impact on Engagement

Company culture significantly shapes how product is built and how stakeholders engage:

*   **Uber's "Principal Confrontation" and "Toe-Stepping":** Uber's culture empowered employees to challenge the status quo and push for ideas (like cash payments) based on data, even if it meant confronting leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. This autonomy fostered a strong, hands-on approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.
*   **Netflix's "Freedom and Responsibility":** Netflix's "no rules rules" culture encouraged structured debate and radical transparency, allowing for the evolution of core tenets (e.g., introducing advertising) if supported by strong arguments, with a clear "informed captain" making the final [[decision_making_in_product_management | decision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>.
*   **Google's "Microcultures":** Google's looser macro-culture allows for diverse "microcultures" within different product areas (e.g., Search vs. Assistant), each with its own norms for [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | execution]] and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. This flexibility allows different products to thrive based on their unique needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.

Regardless of the overarching company culture, product leaders should intentionally cultivate a positive team culture based on principles like "owner, not a renter" and "vulnerability is strength," fostering an environment where team members feel comfortable giving and receiving candid feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>. This relational foundation strengthens internal alignment and makes stakeholder engagement more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>.

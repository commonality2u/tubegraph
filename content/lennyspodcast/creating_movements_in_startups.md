Startups succeed by creating movements, which fundamentally differ from traditional marketing approaches [01:05:19]. Business is never a fair fight, as incumbents hold an inherent advantage [01:11:55]. To win, a startup must "fight unfair" by proposing a radically different future that disorients the incumbent [00:39:41]. This strategy involves changing the subject and denying the premise of existing rules, rather than simply being "better" [01:13:28].

## What is a Startup Movement?

A movement is a distinct method of developing a market, unlike conventional marketing strategies [01:05:19]. It leverages the grievances of a minority against the "tyranny of a majority" [01:05:37]. The goal is to animate people in a way that leads to an emotional commitment to move towards a different future [01:05:46].

Early adopters—whether customers, employees, or investors—are motivated by belief rather than pragmatism [01:05:54]. They align with what the founders believe [01:06:11].

A movement is essentially a group of people who share the same belief and are collectively moving towards a different future [01:06:14]. It crystallizes choice; individuals either believe in the new vision or they don't [01:06:30]. Over time, what was once considered "heresy" can become accepted conventional wisdom as more people join the movement [01:07:28].

### Key Characteristics of Startup Movements

*   **Higher Purpose:** Great movements appeal to a higher purpose rather than merely claiming to be "better" than existing solutions [01:10:10]. For example, Tesla's mission is to "accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy," not just to be a better car company [01:09:54].
*   **Turning Weaknesses into Strengths:** A movement can turn the greatest strength of the status quo into its biggest weakness [01:10:55]. For example, Airbnb created a movement around "living like a local," which implicitly highlighted how traditional hotels offered a uniform, predictable experience, contrasting it with a more authentic local immersion without directly criticizing hotels [01:11:08].
*   **Radical Difference:** Startups win by being radically different, avoiding the "comparison trap" [01:12:42]. For instance, when Lyft launched ride-sharing, nobody compared it to taxis; its difference was self-evident [01:12:42]. Similarly, the Tesla Cybertruck forces a choice rather than a comparison to existing trucks, polarizing opinions but magnetizing those who value its unique advantages [01:12:41].
*   **Solving Desperate Needs:** Successful movements address problems for "desperate people" by offering something unique and irresistibly empowering [01:01:10]. Customers must be so desperate for the solution that they are willing to do business with a startup, even if it means tolerating imperfect execution [01:03:38].

## How to Create a Movement

Creating a movement involves several key actions:

### 1. Harness Inflections and Insights

Movements are often built upon [[role_of_inflections_and_insights_in_startups|inflections and insights]].

*   **Inflection:** An external event that creates the potential for radical change in how people think, feel, and act [01:15:34]. Examples include the iPhone 4S with its GPS chip enabling ride-sharing apps like Lyft [01:15:52], or improved smartphone cameras and network speeds facilitating Instagram [01:17:12]. Inflections can be technological, regulatory (e.g., tele-medicine law changes during COVID-19) [02:25:06], or belief-based (e.g., permanent shift in telemedicine adoption during COVID-19) [02:35:05].
*   **Insight:** A non-obvious truth about how one or more inflections can be harnessed to change people's behavior [01:28:12]. Insights must be non-consensus and "right" [01:29:45]. If an idea is consensus, it's likely not radical enough [01:30:08]. The best startup ideas are often disliked or met with indifference by most, but deeply loved by a subset of people [01:30:27]. This involves "backcasting"—looking for radically different futures and working backward, rather than forecasting the future as an extension of the present [01:31:09].

### 2. Embrace Disagreeableness

All startups are fundamentally disagreeable acts, representing a disagreement with the existing patterns of how things are done [01:25:05]. Founders must be willing to persuade others to change their habits through "pattern breaking actions" [01:25:35].

<div class="callout">
Great founders, like Jonathan Livingston Seagull, are willing to pursue their obsessions and sacrifice their status for the mission [01:25:05]. To stand out, one must be different [01:25:32].
</div>

Founders must possess the courage to be disliked, as their ideas may initially be perceived as stupid or lonely [01:30:16]. This extends to interactions with advisors and investors; a founder should listen but ultimately pursue their own "different truth" if they believe in it [01:26:56].

### 3. Master Storytelling

Storytelling is a crucial element for inspiring early believers [01:12:30]. A powerful narrative distinguishes the "world that is" from the "world that could be," creating an irresistible desire to move to that different future [01:13:50].

<div class="callout">
**The Founder as Obi-Wan:** In the "hero's journey" of a startup, the early believers (customers, employees, investors) are the heroes, and the founder is the mentor (like Obi-Wan Kenobi) [01:16:00]. The founder's job is to craft stories that motivate these heroes to undertake their transformative journeys and co-create the future [01:16:12].
</div>

Different audiences (employees, investors, customers) have different "hero's journeys" and motivations, so the story must be tailored to resonate with each group [01:16:20]. Effective storytelling can be seen in Steve Jobs' iPhone launch, which masterfully transitioned between highlighting the flaws of current phones and the transformative potential of the iPhone [01:17:33].

## Living in the Future

To find breakthrough ideas and catalyze movements, founders must "get out of the present" [01:55:52]. The future is already here, just not evenly distributed [01:56:08].

<div class="callout">
If you're not living in the future, your opinion about it is irrelevant [01:56:52].
</div>

This means immersing oneself in new technologies and cutting-edge developments, actively savoring surprises, and adopting a mindset tuned to discover the undiscovered [03:46:00]. This can be achieved by:

*   **Building for oneself:** Like Mark Andreessen making the Mosaic browser more useful for himself and his team [00:48:21], or Justin Kan initially building Justin.tv for his own reality show [01:13:11].
*   **Working with "Lighthouse Customers":** These are customers who are already living in the future and can illuminate unmet needs [00:58:35]. Solving their problems can lead to solutions desired by many others later [00:59:02].
*   **Proactively Seeking New Futures:** Actively seeking out opportunities to experience different future states, such as a chief of staff shadowing influential figures who visit the future frequently [00:57:32].

This approach generates "earned secrets"—insights gained from getting one's hands dirty at the cutting edge, noticing possibilities that most people overlook [00:17:17]. These secrets become the unique foundation for a startup's radical proposal.

## Internal Chaos and Growth

It's common for successful startups to experience internal chaos and messiness, as movements themselves are often messy [01:31:02]. While [[the_importance_of_velocity_in_startups|execution]] is important, a startup doesn't win by executing *better* than a large company; it wins by proposing a radically different future that disorients the incumbent [01:31:33]. This environment allows for the necessary ambiguity and iteration required to find product-market fit [01:32:02].

## Applying Principles in Large Companies

Even within large companies, the principles of pattern breaking can be applied:

*   **Separate Entities:** Treat pattern-breaking ideas as completely separate entities from the core business, like Apple did with the iPhone or Lockheed with Skunk Works [01:36:59]. This prevents them from being absorbed back into the "tractor beam" of the existing corporate structure [01:37:21].
*   **Small, Discrete Bets:** Instead of expecting a new idea to quickly become a third of the business, make small bets that are allowed to fail frequently [01:35:12]. This willingness to fail enables breakthrough success [01:38:44].
*   **Autonomous Leadership:** These projects should be led by Mavericks with absolute power and discretion, operating somewhat invisibly from the main organization [01:37:11].

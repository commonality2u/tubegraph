Melton Coron Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, emphasizes that company culture comprises two key components: what team members bring to the company and what the company gives back to them [00:55:11]. This reciprocal relationship is crucial for fostering a thriving environment, particularly in rapidly scaling businesses.

## Core Values at Deel

Deel's culture is built around specific values that are publicly shared and consistently reinforced [00:57:54]:

### Deel [[cultural_practices_in_rapidly_scaling_companies | Speed]]
Deel's version of [[cultural_practices_in_rapidly_scaling_companies | velocity]] is "Deel [[cultural_practices_in_rapidly_scaling_companies | speed]]" [00:55:26]. This means acting with urgency regardless of the team's size [00:55:30]. Examples include:
*   Responding to customer problems within 24 hours [00:55:38].
*   Building out new products that many customers request in a fraction of the time competitors would take [00:55:44].

Team members are expected to constantly push themselves to find the quickest and most proper solutions to problems [00:55:57].

### Default [[the_importance_of_optimism_and_joy_in_business | Optimism]]
In a new and evolving business space, [[the_importance_of_optimism_and_joy_in_business | optimism]] is vital [00:56:09]. Deel needs team members who approach challenges with a positive mindset, asking "how can this work?" rather than "why won't this work?" [00:56:20]. This helps in identifying and solving risks proactively [00:56:27].

### Customer Care
A profound care for the customer is fundamental [00:56:35]. Recognizing that the product deals with human livelihoods, such as payroll and legal contracts, makes it incredibly personal [00:56:42]. The focus is not just on improving software, but on enabling businesses to pay their employees so individuals can live their lives and the business can continue growing [00:57:00]. This deep sense of responsibility drives the team's efforts [00:57:09].

## What the Company Gives Back
In return for these commitments, Deel provides its team members with flexibility [00:57:23]. Employees have the freedom to choose where and when they work, allowing them to structure their lives as they wish, provided they contribute effectively to the company's goals [00:57:28].

This culture, while intense, is what sets Deel apart [00:57:39].

## Evolution of Values
Deel's core values were formalized about a year into the company's existence [00:58:08]. Terms like "Deel [[cultural_practices_in_rapidly_scaling_companies | speed]]" were already in common use by the CEO, making it natural to define and formalize them [00:58:17]. The culture organically developed before the official values were set in stone [00:58:47]. This approach reflects the idea that values should represent who a company already is, rather than who it aspires to be [00:59:04].

## Importance of Urgency
A constant sense of urgency is crucial because it keeps people engaged and prevents boredom [00:59:59]. When work moves quickly and accomplishments are visible, it leads to less burnout and greater fulfillment [01:00:13]. Challenging situations, like working on a Sunday during the SVB crisis, can feel like a "war room" experience that, while demanding, makes employees feel "alive" [01:00:37]. These intense, purposeful moments can be incredibly memorable and meaningful [01:01:01].

## Remote Work and Culture
Deel has been a remote-first company from day one, offering the option to work from co-working spaces but otherwise allowing employees to work from home [01:03:32]. This environment fosters authenticity, as colleagues meet pets and partners, building sincerity and camaraderie that might otherwise take longer in a traditional office setting [01:04:42]. This approach allowed the company to build a strong team culture even before many members met in person [01:04:50].

Stripe has been utilizing machine learning (ML) and advanced ML techniques at the core of its products since its early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. This includes solutions like Radar, which addresses payment fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>. The company heavily employs ML to identify and counteract bad actors, such as fraudsters and fraudulent businesses, underscoring its essential role in Stripe's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. Stripe's ability to operate effectively is dependent on these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

More recently, the focus has shifted to Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly the applications of large language models (LLMs) which are built on Transformer technology, a development that originated from Google about four to five years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>. This technology has had a profound [[Impact of AI on product development | impact on Stripe's ability to solve user problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.

## [[Impact of AI on product development | Impact on Product Development]]

Stripe sees two main dimensions to the [[Impact of AI on product development | application of LLMs]]:
1.  **Enabling AI Startups**: AI startups often require monetization from day one due to the high cost of compute resources (e.g., GPU machines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>. Stripe provides the financial infrastructure, such as handling subscriptions, revenue tracking, and financial operations, which allows these startups to focus their valuable engineering resources on core innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Many AI businesses, including OpenAI, utilize Stripe for monetization of products like ChatGPT Plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. This frees up engineers from building reconciliation and subscription systems, allowing them to concentrate on the rapid innovation within the AI space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.
2.  **Enhancing Internal Operations and User Services**: Stripe is leveraging AI internally to better serve its users and improve efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

### Specific AI Applications at Stripe

*   **Documentation**: Stripe is implementing GPT-4 to read and store all its documentation as embeddings, allowing developers to ask questions in natural language and receive answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. This feature is currently in early release within their documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.
*   **Sigma**: This product allows users to write SQL queries to interrogate their Stripe data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>. With LLMs, users can now ask questions in natural language, and the system will generate the SQL query for them, making it more accessible to non-developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
*   **Internal Tools**: AI technologies are being applied to improve internal efficiency, such as answering user questions and facilitating internal collaboration more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. Stripe built an internal integration and UI for GPT-4 to allow its employees to use the models while ensuring data sensitivity and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. This includes shared "presets" or prompts that different teams, including marketing and user support, can use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

### [[Impact of AI on software development | Impact on Engineer Productivity]]

Stripe has made Copilot available to its engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>. A rigorous trial confirmed its effectiveness in boosting productivity and enabling engineers to focus on higher-level problems, such as how components fit together, rather than micro-level tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>.

While it's too early to quantify the specific productivity gains, especially for experienced engineers, Copilot is proving particularly valuable for generating test cases due to the boilerplate code involved in writing comprehensive test suites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. This allows engineers to dedicate more thought to the critical aspects of testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. David Singleton, Stripe's CTO, enjoys writing code with Copilot as it enables him to concentrate on the more important parts of the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

The **[[the_future_of_ai_in_product_management | future of AI in product management]]** and development promises significant innovation in how companies serve users and operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>.

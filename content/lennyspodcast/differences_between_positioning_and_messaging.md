[[April Dunford's methodology for effective positioning | April Dunford]], a renowned expert in product positioning, highlights a common misunderstanding between positioning and messaging in the marketing world. While often confused or used interchangeably, these two concepts serve distinct purposes and have a foundational relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.

## What is Positioning?

Positioning defines how your product is the best in the world at delivering specific value to a well-defined set of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. It is a fundamental marketing concept that outlines:
*   The alternatives to your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
*   How your product is different from those alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
*   The unique value your product can deliver that no other product on the market can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
*   The specific target audience that cares deeply about that unique value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
*   The market category you intend to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

Positioning is about defining how you win in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

## What is Messaging?

Messaging, in its most common understanding, refers to the text on a product's homepage or other marketing materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. It is the articulation of your product's value proposition and how it communicates to the target audience.

## The Relationship Between Positioning, Messaging, and Branding

[[April Dunford's methodology for effective positioning | April Dunford]] stresses that positioning is a fundamental input to messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. You cannot effectively write messaging until you clearly understand:
*   Who the message is for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.
*   Your product's value proposition against its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>.

Similarly, positioning is distinct from branding, though they are often confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. Before defining what a brand should stand for, you must first understand your target buyer and your product's differentiation from market alternatives. Positioning must be figured out first, and then practically everything done in marketing and sales flows downstream from that clear positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Key Takeaway
> Positioning is the strategic foundation that defines your product's unique place in the market. Messaging is the tactical execution of that positioning, communicating your defined value to your target audience.

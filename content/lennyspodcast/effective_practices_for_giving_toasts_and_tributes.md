Toasts and tributes are among the most frequent forms of public speaking events, occurring in various settings like weddings, bar mitzvahs, anniversaries, retirements, or company celebrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. Mastering this skill can be a significant asset in both personal and professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls

Many people dread giving toasts or fail to deliver them effectively. Common complaints include toasts that are too long or focus more on the speaker than the event or the person being honored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.

## Key Principles

The good news is that anyone can improve their ability to give impactful toasts and tributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. While individuals may experience [[techniques_to_manage_public_speaking_anxiety | anxiety]] before giving talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, effective preparation and application of specific techniques can help reduce nervousness and enhance delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

### The "WHAT" Acronym

A useful acronym to structure a toast or tribute is **WHAT** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>:

*   **W - Why are we here?** Briefly state the purpose of the gathering or celebration. While obvious at a wedding, in a work setting (e.g., an all-hands meeting), it's beneficial to explicitly state the reason for the tribute, such as celebrating a product launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.
*   **H - How are you connected?** Explain your relationship to the event or the person being honored. This helps the audience understand your perspective and relevance. For example, "I've known the groom for 25 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.
*   **A - Anecdote.** Share a relevant, concise story or quick example. This is where the core content of the tribute often lies, demonstrating insights and connection to the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. The best [[techniques_for_better_storytelling | storytelling]] often shows emotion rather than just stating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.
*   **T - Thanks/Gratitude.** Conclude by expressing gratitude or thanks. This could be a simple "cheers" at a celebratory event or a more formal expression of thanks to a team or individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.

### Be Brief

A universally appreciated quality of a toast is its brevity. "Nobody has ever complained about a toast that's too brief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. While it's acceptable to include a couple of anecdotes, especially in a work environment for teaching and learning, the overall message should be concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

### Use Emotion Effectively

Emotion, when genuine and authentic, connects powerfully with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. However, excessive emotion can overshadow the message. The most effective way to convey emotion is "through the anecdotes you use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>. Instead of saying "I am so sad," tell a story that evokes sadness, demonstrating the emotion rather than merely stating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>.

### Practice and Get Feedback

Applying the concept of "minimally viable communication," it's beneficial to test your toast, especially for significant events like a company all-hands meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. Practice the toast and get [[methods_for_providing_constructive_feedback | feedback]] from a few trusted individuals. Ask them if it has too many anecdotes or if another story would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. This iterative process, involving repetition, reflection, and feedback, is crucial for improving communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

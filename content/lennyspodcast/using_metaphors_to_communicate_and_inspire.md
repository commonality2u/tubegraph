Metaphors and imagery are powerful tools for communication, capable of rallying teams, simplifying complex ideas, and fostering shared understanding. Amy Vora, Chief Product Officer at Fair, emphasizes their utility in various professional contexts, from product reviews to team alignment.

## The Power of Metaphors and Imagery
Using metaphors and imagery is a skill that helps to rally a team, get points across, and ensure people understand what is being said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:27">[02:26:27]</a>. As a team scales, narrative becomes increasingly important, as it can "carry so much weight and water" by creating a story everyone agrees on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a>. This shared narrative means people naturally know "what to do" without needing individual instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:13">[03:11:13]</a>. This aligns with [[how_storytelling_creates_memorable_communication | how storytelling creates memorable communication]].

## Practical Applications and Examples

### The "Dinosaur Brain" Metaphor for Product Reviews
In product reviews, Amy uses the "dinosaur brain" metaphor to set expectations for executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>. She explains that executives, like a "little tiny dinosaur brain," can only hold about three facts at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. This metaphor helps product teams understand that their best service is to provide clear recommendations rather than overwhelming information, enabling executives to focus on pattern matching and broader context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:52">[01:34:52]</a>.

### The "Hill Climb" Metaphor for Change and Growth
The "hill climb" metaphor illustrates the difference between a local optimum and a global optimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>. It describes the challenge of leaving a comfortable, optimized current state (the top of a hill) to pursue a significantly better, but distant, future state (a mountain). This often involves "climbing down your hill, crossing an unknown chasm, and then climbing back up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:07">[02:57:07]</a>.

This metaphor is useful for:
*   **Setting expectations** that periods of change might feel like a "slog" because "you're still in the valley" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:55">[02:58:55]</a>.
*   **Motivation**, by remembering "what the summit feels like" once the arduous journey is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
Examples include companies transitioning from desktop to mobile platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:59">[02:57:59]</a> or personal decisions like new jobs or relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:55">[02:58:55]</a>.

### "Putting on the Coat of the Job" for Career Decisions
When considering job opportunities, Amy uses the metaphor of "putting on the coat of the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This means emotionally simulating what it would be like to work there, asking questions like:
*   "What would it be like if I were doing this job?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>
*   "What would I think about on my commute?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
*   "Who would I have lunch with? Do I like them?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>
*   "What problems am I going to solve today?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>
This emotional response is often more telling than a spreadsheet analysis of career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### "Face-to-Face Communication" for WhatsApp
For WhatsApp, the product metaphor was "face-to-face communication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:13">[03:11:13]</a>. The goal was to make everyone in the world feel connected, even when geographically distant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:19">[03:17:19]</a>. This involved designing the app to:
*   **Step back from communication:** Allowing the app to fade into the background, similar to how one doesn't think about "what tool do I have to learn" when talking face-to-face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:51">[03:32:51]</a>.
*   **Create intimate spaces:** So users could easily map their app experience to real-world scenarios like a "kitchen table" or "living room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:39">[03:31:39]</a>.
*   **Subtle cues:** Small details like typing indicators or two check marks lighting up reinforce the feeling of presence and being heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:04">[03:41:04]</a>.

## Tactical Advice for Crafting Metaphors

*   **Focus on User Feeling:** When developing a metaphor or analogy for a product, think about "what you want your users to feel when you're using the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.
*   **Identify Similar Feelings:** Then, ask "when else have they felt that same feeling?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. If the desired feeling is "sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday," that analogy informs design and communication to ensure consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
*   **Build "Emulators" for Others:** Amy recommends building "emulators" in one's head for different leaders or colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:11">[03:00:11]</a>. This involves asking: "How would [person's name] approach this problem?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:11">[03:03:11]</a>. This technique provides a fresh lens and access to diverse "toolkits" or skill sets, like understanding "principle decision making" (Bos) or "look at the dashboard" (Rob Goldman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:05">[03:05:05]</a>.
This strategy enhances problem-solving and understanding of different perspectives. This approach aligns with [[techniques_for better_storytelling | techniques for better storytelling]].

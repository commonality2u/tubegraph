Melissa Perri, through her extensive experience in speaking, consulting, interim CPO roles, and teaching at Harvard Business School and online, has worked with over 4,000 to 5,000 product managers and hundreds of companies, deeply consulting with more than 30 organizations on [[the_operating_model_in_product_management | transformation]], setting up product management work, strategy, and roadmaps [00:03:16 | 00:03:53]. Her primary focus is on [[product_management_career_advice | training and education]] in [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product management]] [00:04:28].

## Common Organizational Problems

Many organizations mistakenly believe their issues stem primarily from a lack of [[coaching_and_mentoring_in_product_management | training]] for their people [00:00:03 | 00:00:05]. However, 99% of the time, the problem lies in how goals are set and strategy is deployed [00:00:10 | 00:00:11]. Without proper context for what to work towards, training is ineffective [00:00:13 | 00:00:17].

When product teams face problems, it's often due to a lack of a clear, prioritized strategy [00:08:33 | 00:08:44]. Teams may be working excessively, but metrics aren't moving, leading executives to question what the product and tech teams are actually doing [00:21:56 | 00:22:20]. This indicates a "missing middle" where the connection between tactical work and company-wide objectives is absent [00:25:21 | 00:25:30]. This problem also manifests as executives having different goals, leading to internal conflict rather than unified efforts towards business goals [00:28:51 | 00:29:32].

## Key Product Leadership Roles

### Chief Product Officer (CPO)

A Chief Product Officer is essential when a company needs to unify its product strategy and ensure strong communication between product teams and the executive team [00:10:22 | 00:10:28].

**Signs a CPO is Needed:**
*   **Executive Disconnect**: Executives or the board express that they don't understand what's happening in tech or product, or if goals are being achieved [00:10:31 | 00:10:43].
*   **Lack of Strategic Alignment**: If product teams don't know why they are building certain features or if their work ladders up to a clear company strategy [00:11:11 | 00:11:22].
*   **Scaling Challenges**: Companies transitioning from a single product to a multi-product portfolio, managing complex portfolios, or needing to scale rapidly [00:08:13 | 00:08:20].
*   **Strategic Focus**: When a company needs to rethink its entire strategy, prioritize, and focus amidst many choices [00:08:20 | 00:08:36].
*   **Plateauing Growth**: When successful companies plateau and need to re-prioritize and rethink their approach [00:09:15 | 00:09:19].
*   **Hiring Difficulties**: Trouble hiring [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product managers]] suggests a need for a strong leader who can provide learning opportunities and direction [00:11:57 | 00:12:03].
*   **Growth Milestones**: Often needed when a company exceeds $10 million in ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), especially around $20 to $30 million in a high-growth company [00:12:41 | 00:12:46].
*   **Company Events**: Expansion into new markets, major transformations or pivots, or significant mergers of companies [00:13:03 | 00:13:18].
*   **Product Manager Count**: Typically when a company has around seven or eight product managers, though this can vary [00:13:30 | 00:13:40].

**CPO Responsibilities and Qualities:**
*   **Product Strategy**: Pulling together an all-encompassing product strategy [00:10:22 | 00:10:24].
*   **Communication**: Ensuring great communication with the executive team [00:10:26 | 00:10:28].
*   **Financial Acumen**: Deeply understanding financials to create revenue projections based on product roadmaps and strategy [00:15:06 | 00:15:15].
*   **Executive Navigation**: A fantastic executive navigator who can manage relationships with other executives [00:15:35 | 00:15:39].
*   **Cross-Functional Leadership**: Overseeing multiple functions beyond just product, such as design, product operations, analytics, and sometimes even engineering, especially if there's a lack of strong engineering leadership [00:14:40 | 00:14:59].

### VP/Head of Product

A VP of Product or Head of Product serves as a functional leader for [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product management]] [00:14:47 | 00:14:49]. They are good at implementing processes for smooth product operations [00:14:53 | 00:14:58]. They can pull together roadmaps across product managers and often train junior team members [00:14:58 | 00:15:03].

The main difference from a CPO is their scope; VPs of Product are great at growing one or two products, but a CPO is needed for multi-product or complex platform strategies [00:15:56 | 00:16:07]. They may have design reporting to them, but not necessarily [00:14:51 | 00:14:52].

### Product Managers

At the early growth stage, the focus for [[product_management_roles_and_overhiring | product managers]] is rapid execution and experimentation [00:10:07 | 00:10:11]. Junior [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product managers]] need a clear [[coaching_and_mentoring_in_product_management | training path]] and process to follow [00:12:05 | 00:12:16].

## Bringing in External Help

Consultants or interim CPOs can be beneficial when a CEO is unsure about hiring the right product leader or how to address challenges related to product development [00:16:47 | 00:17:16]. An interim CPO can help keep things on track during a hiring period, ensuring continued delivery and growth, setting a roadmap, and implementing some processes, typically for a temporary period of around three months while a full-time CPO is being sought [00:19:11 | 00:19:55].

It's crucial for companies to be ready to take action and embrace potentially drastic changes when bringing in external help, including changing people or re-evaluating strategy [00:20:25 | 00:20:56]. If a company is unwilling to listen to advice, nothing will change [00:18:12 | 00:18:15].

## The Emerging Role of Product Operations

Product operations is an emerging role aimed at scaling product management, ensuring that processes and insights keep pace with a growing organization [00:44:00 | 00:45:14].

**Components of Product Operations:**
1.  **Internal Data and Insights**: A team that surfaces data from financial systems and user analytics to help track OKRs, monitor strategy progress, and make informed decisions [00:45:34 | 00:46:02].
2.  **Customer and User Insights**: Focuses on external data like market research and standardizing customer research approaches [00:46:04 | 00:46:17]. This prevents multiple teams from bothering the same customers and helps streamline user research to make it more scalable and efficient [00:47:04 | 00:47:27].
3.  **Process Standardization**: Standardizing check-ins, cadences for strategy reviews (e.g., monthly roadmap check-ins, quarterly planning sessions), and processes that interact with other divisions like sales and product marketing [00:47:31 | 00:48:32]. It doesn't standardize internal team processes like stand-ups [00:48:10 | 00:48:15].

## Advice for Product Managers on Strategy and Learning

To get better at strategy, product managers should:
*   **Imagine Being a CPO**: Pretend to be in a CPO's position and consider what actions they would take, asking questions and digging into data for practice [00:39:13 | 00:39:36].
*   **Talk to Leaders**: Engage with Chief Product Officers and other leaders to understand their process for setting priorities and their thought process [00:39:50 | 00:40:05].
*   **Consult Other Departments**: Speak with sales to understand market dynamics, competitor wins/losses, and customer issues [00:40:24 | 00:40:48].
*   **Utilize Data and Research**: Leaders need to start with data from everywhere, including internal data (with the help of a data analyst) and customer research [00:41:10 | 00:41:55].

A good strategy involves making the best-informed decision possible at the time, given all available information, and being willing to correct course if it's found to be the wrong one [00:42:33 | 00:42:57].

For [[product_management_career_advice | continuous learning]] and avoiding burnout from information overload, [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product managers]] should:
*   **Focus on Execution**: Prioritize doing their job well [00:49:36 | 00:49:38].
*   **Self-Retrospection**: Analyze what's working and not working in their own role [00:49:40 | 00:49:42].
*   **Targeted Deep Dives**: Select specific areas for improvement and deep dive into those topics to fill skill gaps (e.g., user research, data analytics) [00:49:44 | 00:50:34].
*   **Adapt Frameworks**: Understand that while core product principles remain, different frameworks and opinions exist, and it's essential to find what works for them and adapt it if it doesn't serve their needs [00:51:12 | 00:52:12]. If a process doesn't serve a team, it should be changed [00:51:43 | 00:51:44].

Organizations often face issues that are mistakenly attributed to a lack of training for their people. However, 99% of the time, these problems stem from the way goals are set and strategy is deployed [00:00:06]. Without a clear context for their work, even trained individuals struggle to contribute effectively [00:00:13]. Developing a robust [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | product strategy]] is crucial for the success of product organizations and overall organizational transformations [00:00:20].

Melissa Perri, having observed countless product organizations through her consulting, teaching, and interim CPO roles, highlights the common problems faced by product teams and how to overcome them [00:00:38], [00:00:44].

## Common Problems with Strategy

A significant issue for scaling SaaS companies, particularly as they transition from a single product to a multi-product portfolio and rapid scaling, is the need to rethink their entire [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | strategy]], focus, and prioritize [00:08:11]. This often marks the first time such companies must form and deploy a comprehensive, prioritized strategy to hundreds or even thousands of employees [00:08:40]. Similarly, companies that plateau often face the same challenge, requiring a strategic re-evaluation and reprioritization [00:09:15].

The core issue frequently boils down to how to set and deploy [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | strategy]], ensure it is well-communicated, and confirm that all tech and product team efforts align with a well-prioritized company strategy [00:09:19].

Signs that a team or company lacks or isn't effectively using its strategy include:
*   **Exhausted teams, stagnant metrics** Teams work excessive hours, constantly crunching and releasing, but key metrics remain unmoved, leading executives to question productivity [00:21:56], [00:22:08].
*   **Product as a "black box"** Executives have little visibility into what tech or product teams are doing or how it contributes to business goals [00:22:10], [00:22:44].
*   **Missing middle** A disconnect exists between low-level tasks (e.g., feature enhancements) and the company's overarching vision and objectives [00:22:25], [00:25:21].
*   **Lack of context for work** Product managers frequently ask "why are we building this?" indicating a failure in leadership to explain the purpose of their work [00:28:25].
*   **Misaligned executive goals** Different executives pursue conflicting goals, leading to internal conflicts instead of working as one cohesive team [00:28:51].
*   **Inconsistent understanding** When asked about the company's vision or goals, different people across the organization provide varying answers, indicating a lack of alignment [00:23:48], [00:23:50].

## Developing and Deploying Strategy

To develop a clear [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | strategy]]:
1.  **Interrogate stakeholders** Ask leaders questions like: "What does good look like for you?" [00:23:40], "Where is the vision?" [00:23:43], "Where are we going?" [00:23:44], "What numbers will change if we release this?" [00:23:28].
2.  **Define a clear vision** A vision should be concrete enough for people to visualize it, lofty enough to require iteration and testing, and distinct from the current state [00:36:14], [00:36:37]. It should articulate how the company will be different, the value it will bring, and who the target customers are, including future customers [00:37:09], [00:37:42], [00:37:49]. Crucially, a good vision also states what the company *will not* do [00:38:16], [00:38:19].
3.  **Prioritize Strategic Intents** Clearly define the big business movers for the next two to three years (e.g., expanding into new markets, innovating new opportunities) [00:24:53], [00:25:02].
4.  **Connect all levels** Ensure that tactical work at the team level (solutions) ladders up to product initiatives (big problems for customers), which in turn connect to the business's strategic intents and vision [00:25:26], [00:31:33], [00:32:02].
5.  **Write it down** Document the vision, market positioning, current product state, and priorities [00:31:05]. Two-pagers are effective for vision and strategic intents [00:24:29], [00:31:03]. Use visuals and diagrams alongside writing for powerful communication [00:34:46].
6.  **Communicate consistently** Everyone in the organization should be able to tell a similar story about what they are working on, why, and how it contributes to the business metrics and overall vision [00:27:54].

When strategy is correctly deployed and there is a culture of executive alignment, trade-off discussions become objective rather than emotional, as everyone shares the same business goals [00:29:33], [00:29:51]. This also reduces infighting among stakeholders and makes it easier to manage priorities and push back on misaligned requests [00:30:10].

## Improving Strategic Thinking as a Product Manager

For [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | product managers]] aiming to enhance their strategic thinking:
*   **Practice "what if" scenarios** Even without the formal role or scope, imagine being the Chief Product Officer and consider what strategic decisions you would make [00:39:10]. This builds experience in asking strategic questions [00:39:33].
*   **Talk to diverse experts** Engage with individuals who deeply understand the market, financials, and other departments (e.g., sales for win-loss analysis) [00:39:43], [00:40:24]. They possess a wealth of knowledge on market trends and competitor innovation [00:40:38].
*   **Understand leadership's thought process** Ask your product leadership about their process for setting strategy, how they arrived at specific priorities, and what data they considered [00:39:50].
*   **Leverage data and analytics** Strategic decisions at higher levels heavily rely on market data, customer insights, and financials [00:40:12]. Product leaders often need to hire data analysts to gather and surface internal data, as well as collect external market and customer research [00:41:01], [00:41:20], [00:46:08].
*   **Embrace decision-making** Strategy is about making informed choices, even if not 100% certain. Be willing to make the best decision possible with available information, and be prepared to correct course if new information suggests a different direction [00:42:13], [00:42:33], [00:42:46]. This iterative approach is key to great strategy [00:42:53].
*   **Learn from other companies** Analyze how successful companies formulated and executed their strategies. Understanding different frameworks and approaches helps build a versatile toolbox [00:43:22]. The common thread is always asking critical questions, analyzing data, and deeply understanding the market and customers [00:43:45].
*   **Focus on execution and introspection** The best learning comes from doing the job, then analyzing what worked and what didn't [00:49:34]. Identify specific skill gaps (e.g., user research, data analytics) and deep dive into those areas to fill them [00:50:36].
*   **Adapt frameworks** While basic product management principles (talking to users, iterative development, measuring success) remain constant, the specific "how" can vary [00:50:58], [00:51:14]. Be flexible and willing to adapt or abandon processes that don't serve your team or help you improve [00:51:41], [00:51:53].
*   **Product Operations** The emerging role of Product Operations addresses the challenges of product management at scale [00:44:00], [00:45:11]. This function helps by:
    *   **Providing internal data and insights:** Surfacing data from financial systems and user analytics to track strategy progress and OKRs [00:45:34].
    *   **Facilitating customer research and user insights:** Standardizing approaches for customer interviews and market research, ensuring efficient data collection and preventing customer fatigue [00:46:02].
    *   **Standardizing processes and cadences:** Establishing consistent check-ins for roadmaps and planning sessions, and ensuring smooth interactions with other divisions like sales and marketing [00:47:31].

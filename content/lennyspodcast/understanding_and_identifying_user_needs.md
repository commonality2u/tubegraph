Bengali Kaba, a seasoned product leader with experience at Facebook, Instagram, Instacart, and YouTube, emphasizes the critical importance of deeply understanding user needs to drive product impact and growth. He champions a framework centered on "understand work" to prevent building products that fail to meet user expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

## The "Understand, Identify, Execute" Framework

Kaba highlights a common "anti-pattern" in product development:
> "Someone says, 'Hey, you know what, this would be great to build,' and you go pull data to go justify why that would be great to build... and then you spend an ungodly amount of time working on it in order to make it work but it ultimately doesn't succeed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>

He calls this "identify, justify, execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

Instead, Kaba advocates for the "understand, identify, execute" framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. This approach prioritizes genuine comprehension of the problem space:
> "First you have to really understand from first principles what is actually going on." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>

### Why "Understand Work" is Crucial
[[The role of empathy and user insights in product management | Understand work]] is an "intentional affordance" in execution, meaning it's a planned activity that helps to de-risk a project and gain crucial insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. By dedicating time to understanding, teams can:
*   Clarify root causes of problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.
*   Identify the true [[understanding_the_jobs_to_be_done_framework | Jobs to Be Done]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   Determine the right use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   Enable teams to challenge proposed ideas by asking what needs to be understood first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.

This leads to a "velocity multiplier" over time, as subsequent sprints are based on better data and clearer insights, resulting in higher win rates for shipped products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

## Operationalizing Understand Work

To effectively implement understand work:
*   **Allocate Dedicated Time**: It should be a planned, intentional part of the roadmap or sprint, not an assumed background activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.
*   **Balance with Execution**: Initially, a team might spend more time on understand work (e.g., 40%), shifting towards more execution (e.g., 80-85%) as the problem space becomes clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. This allows for parallel paths of work, where teams execute on high-conviction items while gaining clarity on future initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
*   **Involve Cross-Functional Partners**: Understand work should involve all relevant functions, including product, design, data science, engineering, go-to-market, and marketing, to ensure a holistic view of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.

### Examples of "Understand Work" Activities
*   **Data Science**: Pulling funnels, analyzing different user connection types, or defining proxy metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>.
*   **Engineering**: Instrumenting logging to gather necessary data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, looking at code for refactoring needs and scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.
*   **Product Management**: Defining partnership strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>, or even "doing a cheap test" to quickly learn and inform future decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

## The Adjacent User Theory

Kaba developed the [[identifying_and_targeting_best_fit_customers | Adjacent User Theory]] during his time at Instagram, a hyper-growth company where the user base constantly evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>. The theory posits that:
*   It's crucial to understand who your current users are and their motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.
*   Just as important is to identify the "next user" â€“ those who *could* be using the product but currently aren't, and understand their barriers to adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>. These users might be less tech-savvy, have different device capabilities, or reside in new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>.

### Applying the Theory: Dogfooding and Observing
To understand the [[interview_techniques_for_identifying_customer_needs | adjacent user]], teams must:
*   "Dog food" the product as if they were a new or different type of user (e.g., creating a new Gmail account to experience YouTube as a first-time user) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.
*   [[interview_techniques_for_identifying_customer_needs | Watch how they use the product]], [[interview_techniques_for_identifying_customer_needs | talk to them]], and literally [[interview_techniques_for_identifying_customer_needs | see what they're doing in real time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.

This theory is mandatory for hyper-growth companies and very helpful for companies seeking to capture more market share from a stagnant user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>.

## Real-World Applications and Impact

### Instagram: Prioritizing Human Connections over Celebrity Follows
Early Instagram's machine learning optimized for celebrity follows, as they generated more clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. However, [[strategies_for_effective_user_research_and_its_business_impact | data showed]] that users would retain initially but then drop off after 7-9 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>. This was because they primarily followed celebrities, and when they made their first post, none of their friends were following them, leading to an "echo chamber" experience and disengagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>.

Through "connections pivot" [[the_integration_of_user_research in_product_development | understand work]], Instagram shifted its focus to prioritizing [[importance_of_timing_and_user_perception_in_product_adoption | getting regular human connections]] for new users in their first few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. This significantly impacted retention, effectively doubling it over a year and a half, by making users feel validated and part of a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.

Another key insight from [[strategies_for_effective_user_research_and_its_business_impact | understanding user needs]] was how frustrating it was for hundreds of thousands of users daily to be unable to log back into their accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:24">[01:20:24]</a>. The product team realized users logged out for valid reasons (e.g., prepaid phone plans, sharing devices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. Instead of preventing logouts, they simplified the login process (e.g., an "Omni box" for email/phone/handle, SMS codes for trusted devices) and added credential saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. This solution not only added 15-20 million monthly active users per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a> but unexpectedly led to more content creation from users accessing multiple accounts, which then spurred the creation of the multi-account team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>.

### Instacart: Simplifying Reordering through User Needs
At Instacart, Kaba observed that despite 90% of repeat orders being the same after five uses, the reordering process was cumbersome, requiring many clicks and only allowing full past orders to be reordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. By [[understanding_the_jobs_to_be_done_framework | understanding the user's job]] (e.g., needing ingredients for "Taco Tuesday" rather than searching for individual items), Instacart made it easier for people to find ingredients related to a meal or simply reorder specific past items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### Facebook India: Understanding Cultural Context of Friending
As the PM for people recommendations at Facebook in 2014, Kaba observed that users in India had significantly fewer common friends and higher rates of friending/unfriending compared to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:21">[01:26:21]</a>. Traditional data analysis and A/B tests failed to provide breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:39">[01:26:39]</a>. This prompted [[interview_techniques_for_identifying_customer_needs | extensive understand work]]: taking teams of engineers to India to observe users in their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>.

They discovered that Facebook's profile page, with its Western-centric fields (school, job title, affiliations), was irrelevant to many Indian users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>. Common names like "Amit Kumar" made it difficult to identify friends without additional context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:49">[01:28:49]</a>. Users instead relied on pictures to identify friends (e.g., "Is this my friend's car or animal?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:26">[01:28:26]</a>. This deep [[understanding_customer_emotions_and_building_empathy_for_product_design | cultural context]] was crucial for developing effective solutions.

Yuki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, emphasizes that a significant part of being a great product manager involves being a great storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>. He considers [[storytelling_and_drawing_in_product_management | storytelling]] such a critical skill that it often appears in performance reviews for his direct reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>.

## Core Aspects of [[the_power_of_storytelling_in_communication | Storytelling]] for Product Managers

Yamashita highlights two specific aspects of [[the_power_of_storytelling_in_communication | storytelling]] that are particularly important in product management:

### 1. The Power of Synthesis
[[Storytelling]] requires the ability to synthesize disparate information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. This means:
*   Distilling many opinions and observations into a cohesive message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>.
*   Creating frameworks or "lenses" to understand and talk about a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>. Yamashita draws parallels to literary commentary, where observations are distilled into a thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>.

### 2. Driving Action and Memorability (Mimification)
A story's effectiveness is measured by its ability to drive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. In a world of constant distraction, it's crucial to tell something powerful that sticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. Yamashita calls this "mimification," where insights (data, research) become so impactful that leaders spontaneously reference them in meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>. This process is key to how knowledge is transferred and action is compelled within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:57">[01:57:57]</a>.

## Cultivating Storytelling Skills

To improve [[the_power_of_storytelling_in_communication | storytelling]], Yamashita suggests:
*   **Resetting your internal computer**: Approach the story from scratch, assuming the audience has no context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.
*   **Escaping the curse of knowledge**: Put yourself in the shoes of a user or stakeholder who knows nothing about the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.
*   **Using [[the_role_of_metaphors_and_imagery_in_product_management | real-world metaphors]]**: Make complex topics accessible, similar to how he learned to explain concepts while teaching computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>.
*   **Compelling others**: A great product manager can make even a seemingly boring problem sound exciting and compel a team to rally around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:48">[01:49:48]</a>.

## Connecting [[the_role_of_storytelling_in_business | Storytelling]] to Owning the "Why"

Yamashita believes that while the "what" and "how" of a product can be shared, the [[role_of_product_managers_in_owning_the_why | PM is uniquely responsible for owning the "why"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:44">[01:42:44]</a>. This philosophy developed at YouTube where, unlike Microsoft's detailed specs, product managers had to empower large teams to make local decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:56">[02:00:56]</a>.

> "If everyone has an understanding of why we're doing this, what problem we're solving, then people can make really great decisions. It's the only way you can really scale." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:56">[02:00:56]</a>

He applies the "five whys" technique, borrowed from Figma's engineering team, to understand the root cause of customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a>. By asking "why" repeatedly, PMs can uncover the underlying condition that created the problem, leading to opportunities for bigger product impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:47">[02:17:47]</a>. This deeper understanding of the "why" is crucial for effective problem-solving and strategic decision-making.

## [[Importance of Communication and Prioritization for Product Managers | Communication]] and Influence

Ultimately, [[the_power_of_storytelling_in_communication | storytelling]] is about [[importance_of_communication_and_prioritization_for_product_managers | communication]] and influencing others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>. It helps PMs convey purpose, inspire action, and ensure alignment across teams, leading to higher quality products and more effective problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:59">[03:59:59]</a>.

>[!INFO] Key Takeaway
>Effective [[the_power_of_storytelling_in_communication | storytelling]] in product management involves not just presenting information, but synthesizing complex ideas, making them memorable, and clearly communicating the "why" behind product decisions to drive action and empower teams.

Michael Tru, co-founder and CEO of Any Sphere, the company behind Cursor, envisions a future for software development that moves "after code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Cursor, recognized as a leading AI code editor, aims to revolutionize how engineers and product teams build software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

## Envisioning "After Code"

The core goal of Cursor is to invent a new type of programming, a fundamentally different way to build software that distills down to describing intent to the computer in the most concise way possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This vision contrasts with two common perspectives:
*   **Traditional Text Editing:** The belief that software building will remain largely the same, focusing on text editing formal programming languages like TypeScript, Go, C, and Rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Chatbot-Style Interaction:** The idea of simply typing requests into a bot, similar to a chatbot or Slackbot interacting with an engineering department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Michael Tru argues that both these visions have problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The chatbot style lacks precision, as humans need more control to specify exactly what they want changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The belief that nothing will change is also deemed incorrect due to the rapid advancements in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

The future of software development, "after code," will feature a representation of software logic that looks more like English or an evolution of programming languages towards pseudo-code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This will allow for high-level editing, making the software more concise and easier to navigate than millions of lines of impenetrable code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The human will remain in the driver's seat, maintaining complete control over all aspects of the software and having the ability to make changes very quickly with a fast iteration loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Evolving Skills in the Tech Industry

In this new paradigm, the skills valued in the tech industry will shift:

### The Rise of "Logic Designer"
Being an engineer will increasingly feel like being a "logic designer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The focus will be on specifying intent for how everything should work, shifting from the "how" (implementation details) to the "what" (the desired outcome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Emphasis on "Taste"
"Taste" will become increasingly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. While taste often relates to visual design (UI/UX), it will extend to the logic of how software works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This means having the right idea for what should be built and effortlessly translating that vision into a working product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. The painstaking, labor-intensive translation layer of current coding will diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>.

### From Carefulness to Taste
The need for extreme carefulness in software engineering, currently a crucial skill, will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. While issues with trusting AI for too many things exist today, the future will allow engineers to be less meticulous and rely more on their "taste" for defining software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.

### Vibe Coding and Control
The concept of "vibe coding" – generating a lot of code without fully understanding the details – is related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. However, current vibe coding can lead to limitations and unwieldy code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>. The challenge is to give users continued control over all details even if they don't fully understand the underlying code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>.

## Cursor's Strategy: The IDE Path

Cursor chose the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) path over merely offering a model or a plugin for existing coding environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

### Human Control
The core belief is to give humans complete control over all decisions in the end product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. While AI is rapidly maturing, it still has "massive issues" and cannot do everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>. This realism, rooted in dogfooding their own product, confirmed the necessity of humans in the driver's seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>.

### Beyond Plugins
The decision to build a full IDE stems from the conviction that programming will flow through AI models and the act of programming will change significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. Existing coding environments have limited extensibility, meaning a full IDE is needed to control the entire application and facilitate the necessary UI and form factor changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.

### The Role of AI Agents
While Cursor is an IDE, the ability to seamlessly move between foreground (direct interaction) and background (AI agent-driven) work is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. For tasks that are easy to specify and verify for correctness (e.g., bug fixes), background AI agents are especially useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>. However, this is not the entirety of programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.

### Managing AI "Reports"
The challenge of becoming "engineering managers with a lot of reports that are just not that smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:46">[01:22:46]</a> is addressed by chopping up tasks into smaller bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:08">[01:24:08]</a>. Instead of large upfront specifications, users should specify a little, get a little work, review, and repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>. This "autocomplete" approach has been most successful for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15">[01:24:15]</a>.

## The "Ensemble of Models" Approach

A counterintuitive learning for Cursor was the necessity of its own model development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. Initially, they thought existing models would suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. However, "every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>.

Cursor utilizes an "ensemble of models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>, combining large generative models (like Sonnet, Gemini, GPT) with its own specialized models:
*   **Custom Models for Speed and Cost:** For use cases like autocomplete, where speed (completion within 300 milliseconds) and cost efficiency are critical, Cursor trains its own models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. These models are highly specialized for predicting series of "diffs" (changes) in codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.
*   **Complementing Foundation Models:** Other custom models assist the larger foundation models. On the input side, they act like a "mini Google search" to find relevant parts of a codebase to show the big models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. On the output side, smaller, faster models "fill in the details" by taking high-level sketches from the smartest models and turning them into full code diffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

This pragmatic approach involves starting from the best pre-trained models, often open-source ones, and tuning them for specific needs, rather than reinventing the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Defensibility

In the AI space, defensibility is less about traditional moats like lock-in and more about continuous innovation and product excellence.
*   **High Ceiling, Constant Evolution:** The ceiling for what can be built with AI is "really high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. This means continuous effort is needed to build the best thing, as leapfrogging is always possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
*   **Consumer-Like Market:** The market for AI tools resembles consumer markets or historical tech shifts like search engines (late 90s) or personal computers (70s-90s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. Switching costs are low, favoring the most innovative product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.
*   **Massive Market Opportunity:** The market for programming tools is much larger than in the past, as AI enables the automation of "busy work" and knowledge work, making workers more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **One General Winner:** While there will be many niche solutions, Michael Tru believes there will be one company that builds the general tool for almost all the world's software, which will be a "generationally big business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

## Tips for Using AI Coding Tools

To maximize success with AI coding tools like Cursor:

### Develop a "Taste" for Model Capabilities
Users need to develop an intuitive understanding of what AI models can do—their complexity handling, necessary specification, and where their gaps exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. This "gut feeling" might need to be rebuilt with each new model launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.

### Chop Up Tasks
Instead of giving the model a large task to complete in one go, break it into smaller, manageable bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>. Specify a little, get a little work, then specify again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. This iterative approach is more successful and avoids disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

### Experiment in a Safe Environment
Explicitly try to discover the limits of what these models can do by being ambitious in a "safe environment," such as a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>. Many users underestimate AI's abilities, and pushing boundaries can lead to surprising results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.

## Impact on Engineering Roles

While AI will automate much of coding, the demand for engineers will likely increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.
*   **Engineers Needed:** Professionals will still be essential to decide what the software looks like, maintaining human control over the end state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.
*   **Increased Productivity:** Engineers will be able to accomplish much more, leading to a surge in software demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.
*   **Reducing Friction:** The high cost and labor intensity of building software today, even for simple things, means there's vast unmet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. AI will reduce this friction, allowing for the creation of far more tools and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.

## Staying Focused in a Rapidly Evolving AI Landscape

Operating at the "white hot center" of the AI space requires deliberate strategies to maintain focus amidst constant launches and chatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:24">[00:59:24]</a>.
*   **Hiring Philosophy:** Hiring people with the right disposition is crucial: those less focused on external validation, more on building something great and high-quality, and generally level-headed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>. This allows the company to operate leanly with less process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.
*   **Leading by Example and Discussion:** Regularly discussing the core vision and setting an example helps keep the team aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>.
*   **Building an "Immune System":** Having professionally worked in AI since 2021-2022, the Cursor team has witnessed a "sea change" of technologies and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. This experience has built an "immune system" to discern truly impactful events from mere chatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. Much progress in AI is attributed to a few simple, elegant ideas, with the vast majority not having staying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

## Misunderstandings about AI's Future

Michael Tru believes people still misunderstand where things are heading with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Extremes:** It's important to avoid the extremes of thinking AI will happen very fast or that it's all "bluster and hype" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.
*   **Consequential and Multi-Decade Shift:** AI represents a technology shift "more consequential than the internet" and "since the advent of computers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. This shift will take a while, spanning multiple decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.
*   **Independent Problems:** Progress requires knocking down numerous independent problems, from improving models (science side) to refining the human experience of working with AI (product experience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Consequential Companies:** Companies that automate and augment specific areas of knowledge work by building both the underlying technology and the product experience will be highly consequential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>. These will be "very, very big businesses" that push the technology forward at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

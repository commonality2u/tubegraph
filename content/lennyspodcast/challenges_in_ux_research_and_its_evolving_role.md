User-centered performance is a practice often seen as symbolic rather than genuinely focused on learning, commonly used to signal customer obsession without necessarily aiming to make different decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A prime example is when a product manager (PM) requests a quick user study at the end of a product process merely to validate assumptions, at which point it's "too late to matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This highlights a prevalent issue in the user research field, which Jud Anon, former Head of Research at Airbnb and consultant, believes is undergoing a "reckoning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Jud Anon has an extensive background in user research, having helped build the practice at Facebook and serving as a longtime Head of Research at Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. His direct reports have gone on to lead research teams at major companies like [[challenges_and_lessons_in_product_management_at_figma | Figma]], Notion, Slack, Robinhood, Duolingo, and Fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Currently, he consults with companies on organizational challenges, product strategy, design, research, hiring, onboarding, and crisis management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The User Research Reckoning
Anon concludes that the user research discipline, as practiced over the last 15 years, is "dying," but it "can still survive and thrive" by adapting quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This "reckoning" is partly triggered by significant layoffs in UX and UX research teams, indicating that the system may be "broken" and research might not be driving its potential value or impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

A core issue is that too much of the "wrong type of research" is being conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Anon attributes this to a "zero interest rates phenomenon" where, during times of easy money, companies hired many researchers but often failed to properly integrate them or leverage their full potential, treating them as a "service function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Jud Anon's Research Framework
Anon proposes a framework categorizing research into three types: Macro, Middle-Range, and Micro research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>:

*   **Macro Research:** This is big-picture, strategic, business-focused, and forward-looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. It involves understanding the overall competitive landscape, concept car projects looking ahead, strategic planning, and Total Addressable Market (TAM) studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **Micro Research:** This type focuses on highly technical usability, enabling a high-quality, pixel-perfect product, and analyzing A/B test results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. It can provide significant business value very quickly, sometimes revealing solutions in as little as 48 hours, such as identifying a confusing button text that, once changed, led to millions of dollars in increased conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.
*   **Middle-Range Research:** This is a "blob place" where research questions are at a "middle altitude," often focused on user understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Anon argues that this type of research, while often interesting to researchers, is "not impactful enough for the business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. It can lead to "post-hoc bias" where results seem obvious, and it can become a form of [[user_centered_performance | user-centered performance]] that doesn't drive actual change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Middle-range research is often requested by PMs to justify decisions they're reluctant to make, by designers because it fits their process model, and by executives who don't fully grasp research's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.

### Qualities of a Great Researcher
To be impactful, researchers need to evolve. The best researchers are "multi-method" and possess five key tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>:
1.  **Formative or Generative User Experience Research:** Forward-looking, innovation-focused, open-ended, often ethnographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
2.  **Evaluative Research:** Such as usability testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.
3.  **Rigorous Survey Design:** The best scaled way to get responses from communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
4.  **Applied Statistics:** Essential for understanding A/B test results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
5.  **Technical Skills:** Historically SQL for running queries; now potentially prompt engineering for interacting with generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

When evaluating candidates, Anon looks for researchers who can propose multi-method approaches to open-ended questions, demonstrating a "Swiss army knife" of skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

## Rethinking the Role of Research

### [[ensuring_business_orientation_in_user_research | Business Orientation]]
A significant challenge is the historical focus of UX practice on user empathy without sufficient attention to business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Researchers need to be more explicit about finding the overlap between user needs and business profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. This includes understanding the company's financial reports, internal strategy documents, OKRs, metrics, and conversion funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. By doing so, researchers can frame their insights in the language of business, making their contributions more impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

### [[importance_of_integrating_ux_research_in_product_development | Integration and Collaboration]]
The root of many problems is that research is often treated as a "service function" that is called in reactively, usually at the end of a product process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. To maximize impact, research must be deeply integrated from the beginning, with researchers involved in ongoing conversations and participating in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. A researcher's role is not just to provide data but to act as a "repository of insights" for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

Integrating research means:
*   **Constant Engagement:** Researchers should have consistent relationships with product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Shared Metrics:** Research teams should share the same success metrics (OKRs) as PMs, engineers, and designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **Influence:** A researcher's success metric is when teams "cannot have that decision-making meeting without the researcher there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

### [[user_centered_performance | User-Centered Performance]]
This phenomenon describes customer obsession or user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than genuinely focused on learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. It's work done to signal customer obsession, not to make different decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. Examples include:
*   **End-of-Process Validation:** PMs asking for quick user studies to validate assumptions when it's too late for real change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
*   **"Check the Box" Research:** Doing research merely to fulfill a requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **Executive Listening Sessions:** Well-intentioned but often performative engagements that don't drive better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

User-centered performance stems from cognitive biases, confirmation bias, and ego. A key mantra for effective research is "we don't validate, we falsify" â€“ seeking to be proven wrong to uncover actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Many PMs and designers, however, are not in this mindset and seek validation, contributing to this performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.

## Addressing Common PM/Designer Tropes about Research

Jud Anon addresses several common complaints or "tropes" about user research from product managers and designers:

1.  **"Research just slows us down / Research is too slow."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>
    *   **Rebuttal:** A good research team can conduct research in a day, a week, or a month, depending on the need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. Getting it wrong and having to fix it is slower than taking the time to get it right initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. Micro-level research, for instance, can provide results in 48 hours and drive significant business value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.
2.  **"I can do my own research; why do I need researchers?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>
    *   **Rebuttal:** While product people should engage with customers, merely talking to a user doesn't constitute research or insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>. A single user's feedback, while potentially powerful, can also be idiosyncratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. Researchers know how to deeply understand conversations, situate them, and avoid biases from unguided feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
3.  **"A/B test everything."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>
    *   **Rebuttal:** A/B tests are valuable for establishing causal claims about products but rarely explain *how* or *why* things happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. Without understanding the "how and why," it's difficult to avoid making the same mistakes or to build a better product beyond the narrow scope of the A/B test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. Strong partnerships between data scientists and researchers are essential to combine causal understanding with deep qualitative insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>.
4.  **The Apocryphal Henry Ford Quote: "If I'd asked my users, they would have said faster horses."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>
    *   **Rebuttal:** This quote, which turns out to be apocryphal, fundamentally misunderstands what researchers do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. Good researchers do not ask customers what they *want* but rather observe and understand their behaviors, needs, and pain points to inform innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
5.  **"We knew this already; that was obvious."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>
    *   **Rebuttal:** This reflects "hindsight bias," where information seems obvious after the fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. People tend to selectively remember and construct narratives to make past events seem predictable, a phenomenon known as the "narrative fallacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. Great researchers help to expose biases and expand horizons, constantly improving intuition with evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

## Optimizing Research Integration and Staffing
For companies, integrating different insights disciplines (UX research, consumer insights, market research, data science, customer service feedback) into a unified function can overcome information silos and provide a clearer picture for product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.

Regarding the ideal number of researchers, there's no single ratio. The key is to have enough researchers so that every essential product team has a consistent research partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Instead of trying to cover every product space thinly, it's better to pair researchers with partners who will involve them in a consistent, engaged process and protect their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>. This creates a "pain of loss" for other teams, driving demand for more researchers based on demonstrated impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.

Even early-stage startups can benefit significantly from hiring a researcher, as a good researcher can help companies go faster and drive impact by answering questions impossible to address otherwise, especially during critical iterations or pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>.

## The NPS Critique
Jud Anon holds a strong opinion against Net Promoter Score (NPS), calling it "the best example of the marketing industry marketing itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>. He argues that NPS is fundamentally flawed from a survey science perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>:
*   The likelihood to recommend question is problematic (0-10 scale, often unlabeled, 11 items which decreases precision, especially on mobile where options may be below the fold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>.
*   The question often doesn't align with natural user behavior (e.g., how likely are you to recommend an operating system?) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.
*   Despite claims of indicating loyalty, customer satisfaction (CSAT) is a simpler, more precise, and more reliable metric that correlates better with business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.
*   NPS benchmarks between companies are often inconsistent due to idiosyncratic scores and variations in how the question is asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>.

## The PM's Role in Research Collaboration
The relationship between product managers and researchers is often one of the most challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. To be better partners and leverage research more effectively, PMs should:
*   **Create Integrated Processes:** Ensure user researchers are involved from the very beginning to the end of product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Ruthlessly:** Help researchers focus on a manageable number of high-impact projects, ideally around two big and one small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>.
*   **Engage Directly:** Take the time to participate with researchers, even going into the field for studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>. This direct experience helps burst "bubbles" of assumption and provides powerful, immediate insights that can be more impactful than statistical significance alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.
*   **Be Wary of Own Intuition:** While dogfooding a product is important for PMs, they must recognize that their experience is not like the average user's due to biases and contextual differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. Prioritizing identified issues should involve external research, not just personal judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.

### For Researchers
Despite challenges, the future for the discipline is bright. Researchers should:
*   **Develop Diverse Skills:** Master the "five tools" of research (formative, evaluative, survey design, applied statistics, technical skills) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Deepen Business Knowledge:** Understand business language, metrics, and strategy to apply insights like a scalpel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.
*   **Build Strong Relationships:** Foster partnerships that allow for active participation rather than being a service function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
*   **Learn to Say No:** Focus on fewer, higher-impact projects in collaboration with partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Be Excellent Communicators:** Effectively convey insights to diverse audiences, from PMs to executives, in appropriate language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>.

The evolution of UX research requires both companies to adopt a more inclusive model and researchers to proactively develop skills and influence, moving beyond a "powerless" mindset to drive significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

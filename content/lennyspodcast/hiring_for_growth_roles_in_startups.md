Hiring for growth roles in a startup requires a strategic approach, focusing on internal evolution and a deep understanding of the company's specific [[developing_growth_models_for_startups | growth model]]. It's crucial to avoid common pitfalls like premature hiring or expecting quick fixes from external hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:50">[53:50]</a>.

## When to Hire for Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:19">[55:19]</a>

Growth discussions and hiring should only commence once a company has achieved strong [[challenges_and_strategies_for_creating_successful_startups | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:28">[55:28]</a>.
This means:
*   **Demonstrable Retention:** There must be evidence of customer retention, ideally measured over at least six months to a year post-initial offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:36">[55:36]</a>.
*   **Acquisition and Monetization Potential:** The company should show "green shoots" or initial ability to acquire and monetize customers, indicating distribution potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50">[55:50]</a>.

Hiring a growth person to *figure out* the [[developing_growth_models_for_startups | growth model]] from scratch is often a mistake and a delegation of the founding team's core responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:10">[56:10]</a>. The founding team should establish the initial growth model themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31">[56:31]</a>.

## Where to Find Your First Growth Hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:00">[52:00]</a>

The philosophy behind growth is one of "evolution, not revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:18">[52:18]</a>. The goal is to evolve the organization to adopt a growth mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21">[52:21]</a>.

### Prioritize Internal Talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:27">[52:27]</a>
It is often more beneficial to find an internal candidate for the first growth hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:29">[52:29]</a>. This could be:
*   A finance or planning analyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:31">[52:31]</a>
*   An existing product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:32">[52:32]</a>
*   A data analyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:34">[52:34]</a>
*   An engineer who is business-connected and technically inclined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:36">[52:36]</a>

#### Benefits of Internal Hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:36">[53:36]</a>
*   **Product Familiarity:** Internal hires are already familiar with the product and how its [[developing_growth_models_for_startups | growth model]] should function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:55">[52:55]</a>.
*   **Authenticity:** A [[developing_growth_models_for_startups | growth model]] should be authentic and local to the product offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:03">[53:03]</a>. An external hire might try to "slap their previous company's gross model" onto a new product, which often leads to a high failure rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:10">[53:10]</a>.
*   **Quick Wins:** Internal hires can often provide quicker initial wins due to their existing context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:36">[53:36]</a>.

### Considerations for External Hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:43">[52:43]</a>
Bringing in an external hire, especially as the first growth hire, carries significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:51">[52:51]</a>.
*   **Time for Understanding:** External hires require substantial time (3-6 months or more) to understand the product's [[developing_growth_models_for_startups | growth model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:26">[53:26]</a>.
*   **Pressure to Perform:** If under pressure for immediate acceleration, external hires may resort to "copy-pasting" previous successes, which rarely works effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:08">[54:08]</a>. Even direct competitors might have vastly different [[developing_growth_models_for_startups | growth models]] that wouldn't translate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:25">[54:25]</a>.
*   **Failure Rate:** Copy-pasted success patterns have an "extremely high failure rate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:52">[54:52]</a>.

[!WARNING] **Avoid the Trap:** Do not hire externally simply because growth is slowing, expecting an outside person to "fix it." This often leads to short tenures and little step-function change in growth trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:47">[53:47]</a>.

## Modern Approaches to Leadership Hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50">[11:50]</a>

The traditional method of hiring leaders through recruiting agencies or direct CEO outreach can be "broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04">[12:04]</a>.

### "Try Before You Buy" Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00">[13:00]</a>
A more effective approach for both the company and the candidate, especially for optimizing retention in leadership roles, is a "try before you buy" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57">[12:57]</a>.
*   **Advisory Roles:** Starting as an advisor can help a candidate gauge the fit before committing to a full-time role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02">[13:02]</a>.
*   **Interim Gigs:** Interim leadership roles allow the individual to keep the "bus moving," help the company understand the type of leader it needs, and facilitate the transition to a full-time hire, essentially "succeeding myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55">[10:55]</a>. This allows the leader to gauge accountability and impact while the company secures a good hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10">[11:10]</a>.
*   **Conversion to Full-Time:** After a trial period (advisory or interim), a candidate can then convert to a paid full-time contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08">[13:08]</a>.

This approach addresses the mismatch often seen in leadership hiring, where both sides "sell rainbows and unicorns" and avoid discussing existing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30">[12:30]</a>. It's a riskier bet for the candidate, as a role makes up a "large chunk of your career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17">[12:17]</a>.

## General Tips for Driving Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:55">[56:55]</a>

When thinking about growth, focus on:
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Understand how to find patterns in the problems being solved, rather than treating each issue individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:07">[57:07]</a>.
*   **Framework-Based Solutions:** Develop and apply frameworks for problem-solving. This makes solutions more scalable, repeatable, and sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:23">[57:23]</a>.
*   **Minimize Context Switching:** The ability to minimize context switching in problem-solving is key to creating a repeatable, sustainable, and competitively defensible [[developing_growth_models_for_startups | growth model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:57">[57:57]</a>. This also fosters a growth culture and mindset that people can grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:07">[58:07]</a>.

The field of user research is currently undergoing a "reckoning," which necessitates a shift in how companies utilize and integrate user experience (UX) research within product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This reckoning is partly driven by widespread layoffs in UX and UX research, signaling that the current system may be broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. The core issue is that user research often fails to drive the value or impact it should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.

## User-Centered Performance: A Misguided Practice

A common phenomenon observed in product development is [[challenges_in_ux_research_and_its_evolving_role | user-centered performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This refers to a customer-obsessed or user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than genuinely focused on learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It's often work done to signal [[developing_user_empathy_and_gathering_insights_for_product_development | customer obsession]] without intending to make different decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

For example, when a Product Manager (PM) asks a researcher to run a quick user study at the end of a product process "just to validate our assumptions," that's user-centered performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. It's too late for the research to genuinely impact the decision, as the product is ready to ship, and the goal is simply to "check the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Many PMs and designers are looking to validate their ideas rather than to be proven wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

> "We don't validate, we falsify. We are looking to be wrong." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>

## The Three Levels of Research

Research can be categorized into three types:

*   **Macro Research:** This is big-picture, strategic, [[ensuring_business_orientation_in_user_research | business-focused]], and forward-looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. It involves looking at market trends, competitors, and long-term product direction, often for [[innovations_in_product_design_and_user_experience | innovation]] and strategic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
*   **Micro Research:** This type of research is highly technical and focused on usability, ensuring a high-quality, pixel-perfect product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. It's used for laser-focused insights, such as understanding A/B test results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Micro research can be incredibly fast and derive significant business value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:16:00">[35:16:00]</a>. For example, changing seven characters on a button's call to action resulted in millions of dollars for Airbnb, based on micro-level user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>.
*   **Middle-Range Research:** This is where many problems lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. It addresses questions that are "middle altitude," often focused on user understanding, such as how a specific group of people thinks, feels, or behaves with a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. While often interesting to researchers, this type of research can be less impactful for the business because the questions are not pointed enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. It can lead to insights that are hard to operationalize, trigger hindsight bias ("we knew that already"), and fulfill the need for [[developing_user_empathy_and_gathering_insights_for_product_development | user-centered performance]] without driving real change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

## The Vicious Cycle of Misintegrated Research

Many companies hired researchers with good intentions but failed to properly integrate them into product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>. Research was often treated as a "service function," called in reactively at the end of a process, with limited input on framing questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:04]</a>. This leads to less impactful research, causing executives to conclude that researchers aren't valuable, resulting in sidelining or layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>.

## Reorienting Research for Impact

To move beyond the reckoning, both researchers and companies must adapt:

### For Researchers: Developing Diverse Skills and Business Acumen

Great researchers possess a "Swiss Army knife" of skills, extending beyond traditional qualitative methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>:

1.  **Formative/Generative UX Research:** Forward-looking, [[innovations_in_product_design_and_user_experience | innovation-focused]], open-ended, and ethnographic approaches to understand where the product should go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>.
2.  **Evaluative Research:** Focusing on usability testing and evaluating products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.
3.  **Rigorous Survey Design:** The best-scaled way to gather responses from communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>.
4.  **Applied Statistics:** Essential for interacting with A/B testing and quantitative data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.
5.  **Technical Skills:** Historically SQL for querying data, now potentially [[innovations_in_product_design_and_user_experience | prompt engineering]] for generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>.

Researchers also need to be much more [[ensuring_business_orientation_in_user_research | business-oriented]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>. This means:
*   Understanding quarterly reports, shareholder calls, and business language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>.
*   Knowing the company's OKRs, metrics, and conversion funnel inside and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>.
*   Framing research questions in terms of business impact, such as identifying opportunities in the funnel or responding to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:33]</a>.

### For Companies and Product Teams: Deep Integration and Collaboration

The solution lies in restructuring how products are made to more fully integrate research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. This means:
*   **Consistent Relationships:** Researchers and their insights should be part of the product process from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.
*   **Proactive Engagement:** A researcher's participation in conversations from the outset can help frame the right questions for maximum business and product improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>.
*   **Shared Metrics:** Teams (PMs, engineers, designers, researchers) should have the same metrics for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>.
*   **Unified Insights Function:** Avoid siloing different insights disciplines (UX research, consumer insights, market research, data science, customer service feedback) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>. Instead, integrate them to fuel a single, coherent insights machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:05:00">[50:05:00]</a>.

## Debunking Common Tropes about Research

Common misconceptions about research that hinder its effectiveness include:

*   **"Research just slows us down"**: A great research team can deliver results in a day, week, or month, depending on the need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:00">[33:52:00]</a>. Good research actually speeds up product development by preventing costly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:32:00]</a>.
*   **"I can do my own research"**: While anyone can talk to a user, this doesn't constitute rigorous research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>. Researchers possess the expertise to avoid biases, turn feedback into actionable insights, and understand nuances that non-experts might miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:51:00">[39:51:00]</a>.
*   **"A/B test everything"**: A/B tests tell you *what* happened but rarely *why* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:08:00">[40:08:00]</a>. Research explains the "how and why," which is crucial for building better products and avoiding future mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>.
*   **"If I'd asked my users, they would have said faster horses" (Henry Ford quote)**: This quote is apocryphal and misrepresents what good researchers do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>. Researchers do not simply ask customers what they want; they uncover needs and behaviors to inform [[importance_of_design_and_functionality_in_product_development | product development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:56:00">[42:56:00]</a>.
*   **"We knew this already; that was obvious" (Hindsight Bias)**: This is a form of self-gaslighting, where people selectively remember and construct narratives to feel like they already knew an outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:18:00">[43:18:00]</a>. The book "Everything is Obvious If You Already Know the Answer" by Duncan Watts highlights this cognitive bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:24:00">[43:24:00]</a>.

## Balancing Intuition with Evidence

While intuition is valuable in product development, it's also where biases and blind spots lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a>. To check intuition, engage in "system two" (slow, methodical) analytic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a>. Additionally, bring in the "wisdom of the crowd" by gathering diverse sources of information and judgment from different individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:00">[30:58:00]</a>.

Researchers, when consistently involved in the product process, can help expand horizons and ensure intuition is constantly improving, leading to better product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>.

### The Problem with Dogfooding

Relying solely on one's own product usage or "dogfooding" can be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. PMs are not like typical users; their expertise and context bias their perception of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>. While dogfooding is good for identifying potential issues, prioritizing those issues and understanding their impact requires external, unbiased insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.

## Empowering Researchers and Building Strong Partnerships

The biggest challenge for UX researchers often lies in their relationship with product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>. To overcome this:

*   **For Product Managers:** Create processes that integrate user researchers and insights from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. Be willing to partner on ruthless prioritization, allowing researchers to focus on fewer, more impactful projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:44:00">[51:44:00]</a>. PMs should actively participate in research activities, even accompanying researchers into the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:09:00">[52:09:00]</a>.
*   **For Researchers:** Develop diverse research skills, deepen [[ensuring_business_orientation_in_user_research | business knowledge]], and build strong relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>. Learn to say no and focus on the most important things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:42:00">[48:42:00]</a>. Effective communication, tailored to the audience, is crucial for impact and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.

There isn't a fixed ratio for the number of researchers needed, as it depends on product stage and company context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:10:00">[57:10:00]</a>. However, a good indicator is when product teams experience "the pain of loss" if a researcher is not available, showing they recognize the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:05:00">[58:05:00]</a>. Even in early-stage startups, a researcher with a "Swiss Army knife" of tools can provide incredible value, helping founders make evidence-based decisions rather than relying solely on guesswork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the future of user research is bright, but it requires both companies to build more inclusive models and researchers to proactively develop diverse skills and influence to drive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

### On NPS (Net Promoter Score)

Jud Anon holds a strong opinion that NPS is an unreliable metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>. According to survey science consensus, NPS makes several mistakes:
*   The "likelihood to recommend" question is flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>.
*   It uses a 0-10 scale that is often unlabeled, and 11 items, which reduces precision (precision generally goes down after 5-7 items) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.
*   The question itself is fundamentally flawed, as not everyone is inclined to recommend operating systems or similar products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   NPS is idiosyncratic and inconsistent in how it's asked, making apples-to-apples comparisons across industries unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>.

A simple customer satisfaction (CSAT) metric, such as "Overall, how satisfied are you with your experience with [product/service]?", is more precise, has better data properties, and correlates more strongly with business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.

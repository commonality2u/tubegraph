Effective [[the_relationship_between_product_managers_and_user_researchers | collaboration between research and product teams]] is crucial for building cutting-edge AI products, especially in a rapidly evolving technological landscape where models are constantly improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

## OpenAI's Evolution and Collaborative Model

OpenAI's journey highlights the dynamic interplay between research and product development. Originally a pure research company, it evolved into a product company as offerings like ChatGPT grew in popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. The Chief Product Officer, Kevin Weil, emphasizes that OpenAI must remain both a world-class research company and a world-class product company, with the two functions working hand-in-hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.

The company has deliberately focused on improving this collaboration over the past six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

### Dangers of Separation
Treating research and product functions separately can lead to product and engineering teams merely consuming models as if they were external APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. This approach misses the opportunity for deep, iterative improvement.

### Integrated Approach
The ideal model involves product design and research working together as a single team to build novel things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. This means:
*   **Iterative Feedback Loop** Teams engage in a constant cycle of understanding problems, designing solutions, and building evaluations (evals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Fine-Tuning** Evals are used to gather data and fine-tune models, improving their performance for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. This ensures models become better at the problems they are intended to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.
*   **Early and Public Iteration** OpenAI adopts an "iterative deployment" philosophy. They ship products even without knowing the full capabilities, learning and co-evolving with society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

## Future of Product Teams and Research Integration

Kevin Weil predicts that in the future, researchers will be integrated into every product team, not just at foundational model companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>. This is driven by the increasing importance of fine-tuning models for particular use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.

### The Role of Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuning involves providing a model with thousands of examples of problems and good answers, teaching it to be much better at a specific task than its base capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. This process will become a core workflow for building most products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>.

### Hybrid Roles
Product teams will increasingly need "quasi-researcher" or "machine learning engineer" types to handle fine-tuning and specialized model applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>.

### Ensemble of Models Analogy
Kevin Weil likens a company to an "ensemble of models" (humans) who have been fine-tuned by their education and careers to possess different skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>. Grouping these diverse "models" (people) together leads to better collective output than any single individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:14]</a>. This analogy extends to how AI models can be used in concert:
*   **Specialized Models** Different models or fine-tuned versions can be used for specific problems based on latency or cost requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:20]</a>.
*   **Custom Prompts** Using custom prompts for each task helps teach the model to excel at specific sub-problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:34]</a>.
*   **Problem Decomposition** Breaking down a broad problem into more specific tasks allows for more effective application of specialized models, including fine-tuned ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:42]</a>.

For example, in customer support, OpenAI uses an ensemble of models, some of which are specialized or fine-tuned, to automate responses and manage incoming tickets efficiently. Human answers to unresolved queries then serve as fine-tuning data for the models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:02:23]</a>.

### Impact on Product Manager Role
OpenAI maintains a "PM-light" organizational structure, believing that too many Product Managers can hinder execution by focusing on decks and ideas rather than output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:33]</a>. This philosophy empowers engineers to make decisions and encourages [[integrating_user_research_effectively_into_product_development | product-focused engineers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:57]</a>.

Product Managers at OpenAI are expected to be:
*   **High-Agency** Proactively identifying and solving problems without waiting for permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:05]</a>.
*   **Comfortable with Ambiguity** Operating in an environment where problems are often ill-formed and solutions are discovered iteratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:43]</a>.
*   **Decisive** Knowing when to defer to the team and when to make a critical decision to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:52:09]</a>.
*   **Skilled in Influence** Leading through influence, especially when collaborating with self-directed research teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:51:16]</a>.

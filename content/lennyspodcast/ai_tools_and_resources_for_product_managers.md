From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Marily Nika, a Product Lead at Meta focusing on metaverse avatars and identity, and formerly at Google working on Google Glass, computer vision, and machine learning around speech recognition, shared her insights on the evolving landscape of AI in product management on Lenny's podcast. She also teaches a popular course on AI and product management on Maven. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>

## Core Principle: Solving Problems with AI

Marily emphasizes the importance of using AI to solve actual problems, rather than just doing AI for its own sake. She refers to this as avoiding the "shiny object trap." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> Product managers should identify a specific pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way before considering AI implementation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>

## AI's Impact on Product Management

### The Future of Product Management: AI by Default
Marily believes that in the future, every product manager will be an [[ai_product_management_strategies | AI product manager]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> This is because all products will eventually need personalized experiences, effective recommender systems (e.g., Netflix recommendations), and enhanced automation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> AI will be baked into every product to help users and make products work better. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>

### Partnering with Research Scientists
A key aspect of this future is that product managers will need to be comfortable partnering with research scientists. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a> These scientists are crucial for producing smart models that enable automation, personalization, and recommendations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>

> [!NOTE] The Product Perspective
> Marily suggests thinking of product development with AI in terms of three intersecting "bubbles":
> 1.  **Desirable by users** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>
> 2.  **Viable business** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>
> 3.  **Feasible from a research scientist and technical perspective** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>

## Practical Applications of AI for Product Managers

### Leveraging ChatGPT
Marily uses ChatGPT daily in her workflow to enhance her output. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>

*   **Crafting Mission Statements:** She uses ChatGPT to rewrite mission statements, finding its output superior for broad audiences including leadership, junior staff, stakeholders, and even competitors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>
*   **Creating User Segments/Personas:** ChatGPT can generate detailed user segments with motivations and pain points that a human might not consider. For example, when creating a fitness band without a screen, it could identify target users like young professionals with limited time or individuals who don't want to charge devices daily. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   **Generating AI-Enhanced Ideas:** It provides ideas for products or features that can be enhanced with AI. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>

> [!CAUTION] Augmentation, Not Replacement
> Marily stresses that she uses ChatGPT to **enhance** her work, not to do her job for her. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> She engages with the tool after having a clear mission and objective in mind. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> She firmly believes that AI will not replace product managers; instead, it will free up time for more strategic work. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>

### When to Adopt AI (and When Not To)

#### The "Shiny Object Trap"
As mentioned, it's crucial not to pursue AI simply because it's a popular trend. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> Always start by identifying a clear problem and pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>

#### When to Use AI
AI is most beneficial when you have data on user behavior that can be used for:
*   Making features smarter (e.g., security, personalization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>
*   Fraud detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
*   Improving ethics (e.g., in healthcare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>
*   Increasing speed or accuracy (e.g., in shopping recommendations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>
*   Leveraging existing data, especially from adjacent products, to create meaningful features like recommendations or automation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>

#### When Not to Use AI (MVP, Insufficient Data)
*   **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Do not use AI for an MVP. It's a waste of time and resources. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a> Instead, create a Figma prototype and manually "fake" the AI functionality to get user feedback and market validation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>
*   **Insufficient Data:** The amount of data needed for AI/ML varies significantly. Simple classification (e.g., cat vs. dog) might only need 15-20 labeled photos, but complex NLP or voice recognition requires thousands. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> Startups often lack the massive datasets needed to build their own models. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>
*   **Building Your Own Model vs. Using Existing Tools:**
    *   **Build Your Own:** Recommended for big tech companies offering services like speech recognition or their own GPT-like capabilities, where diversifying data and quality are crucial for differentiation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>
    *   **Use Existing Tools:** More suitable for most startups or smaller teams that can leverage public models like ChatGPT or Midjourney. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>

### Understanding AI Models and Training

*   **What is a Model?** A model is likened to a child's brain. Just as a child learns to identify animals after repeated exposure (e.g., "here's what a rhino looks like"), an AI model takes an input (like an image) and recognizes it, outputting a probability of its certainty (e.g., "that looks like a rhino, I'm 70% sure"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a> This concept applies to various inputs like text (ChatGPT), video, or voice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>
*   **Training a Model:** This involves providing large datasets (thousands of images, for instance) with labeled information. The model processes this information, learns patterns in a "smart way" that humans may not fully understand, and then outputs predictions or probabilities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a> For example, a speech recognition model takes audio input and outputs a text transcription. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>

> [!EXAMPLE] Cool AI Application: Google Glass Language Translation
> Marily worked on an AR/VR team at Google that developed a Google Glass application demonstrated at Google I/O. The glass could take audio from one person speaking a language, transcribe and translate it, and display it on the screen for another person speaking a different language. This unlocks communication barriers in real-time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>

## Developing Your [[improving_product_management_skills | Product Management Skills]]

### Overcoming Intimidation
Product managers should not be overwhelmed or intimidated by AI technologies, even without a technical background. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a> It's not necessary for a PM to actually train or code models, though there are no-code approaches for model training. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>

### Recommended [[skills_for_modern_product_managers | Learning Paths and Resources]]

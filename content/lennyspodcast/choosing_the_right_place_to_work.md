Bengali Kaba, a seasoned product leader with extensive experience at Facebook, Instagram, Instacart, and YouTube, offers a powerful framework for individuals navigating their careers and seeking to maximize their professional impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. His insights stem from a personal struggle at Facebook to objectively decide his next career move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## The Impact Equation
Kaba's foundational framework, outlined in his "How to Choose Where to Work and What to Work On" blog post, posits that impact is the most crucial variable for career success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Impact, he argues, is the true driver of compensation and professional leveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

The core equation is:
**Impact = Environment x Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>

This means that to achieve significant impact, individuals must analyze and optimize both their work environment and their personal skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### The Environment
The "Environment" component refers to the external factors influencing your ability to have an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Kaba identifies six key variables within the environment:

*   **Manager** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>: A great manager can significantly influence other environmental factors like scope and team composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. While you don't always have to "like" your manager, respect and a learning opportunity are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Understanding what your manager is optimizing for can help align your work and find synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Resources** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>: This includes having an appropriately staffed team and sufficient budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Scope** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>: The extent of your responsibilities and control over important areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Having too much or too little scope can hinder impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Team** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>: The relative skills and composition of your immediate team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Compensation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>: Feeling fairly compensated is important for finding your work meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Company Culture** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>: Whether the culture supports and includes you, allowing you to do your best work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Kaba recommends annually scoring each of these variables (on a scale from 0 to 2, with 2 being highly beneficial) to objectively assess where you are hindered and where you have control to make changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Your Skills
The "Skills" component focuses on your personal abilities that contribute to your impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Key skills include:

*   **Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>: The most impactful skill, enabling you to tell a compelling story and rally support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   **Influence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>
*   **Leadership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>
*   **Strategic Thinking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>
*   **Execution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>: The ability to actually get things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

To develop these skills, Kaba advises:
*   **Be a voracious reader:** Consume podcasts, blogs, and thought leadership to build your toolkit of frameworks and mental models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   **Cultivate a "stable of mentors":** Instead of one mentor, aim for three or four, meeting each monthly on different weeks to ensure consistent support and diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. When seeking a mentor, clearly articulate the specific challenge or skill you want to learn from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   **Learn from others' practice:** Observe how experienced product managers or leaders conduct meetings, land frameworks, and communicate messages, then integrate those techniques into your own approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

## Related Concepts for Driving Impact

### The Importance of [[understand_work | Understand Work]]
A crucial strategy for driving impact and avoiding wasted effort is dedicating intentional time to what Kaba calls "understand work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. This contrasts with the "identify, justify, execute" anti-pattern where teams build based on assumptions and then seek data to justify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

Instead, the process should be "understand, identify, execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. Understand work is a planned, intentional time for the team to de-risk a project and deeply learn what's happening from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. It involves activities like:
*   Data scientists pulling funnels and analyzing different user types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.
*   Engineers instrumenting logging for better data visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   Product managers strategizing partnerships before launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   User research and gathering feedback from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.

While it might seem counterintuitive to "slow down to speed up," dedicating time to understand work leads to a "velocity multiplier" over time, increasing the win rate of shipped products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. Kaba notes that teams might start with a 60% execution / 40% understand work split, shifting to 80-85% execution as their understanding deepens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

### Coaching and Team Building
Kaba emphasizes that product management is a "team sport," where the product manager acts as a coach to enable and maximize team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. He draws parallels between teaching and product management, noting that both require strong communication, a clear vision, and the ability to influence others to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.

He applies Bloom's Taxonomy, an educational framework, to assess where team members are struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. This pyramid-like framework includes levels of thinking:
1.  **Knowledge**
2.  **Comprehension**
3.  **Application**
4.  **Analysis**
5.  **Synthesis**
6.  **Evaluation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>

By identifying whether a team member lacks core knowledge, struggles with application, or can't synthesize information, leaders can tailor support and build skills effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

Additionally, Kaba stresses the importance of building a "coaching tree" â€“ fostering and growing subordinates who go on to achieve significant roles, reflecting on your legacy as a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.

### Understanding the "Adjacent User"
For driving growth, particularly in hypergrowth companies, Kaba highlights the concept of the "adjacent user" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>. This refers to the potential user who *could* be using your product but, for some reason, isn't finding it suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>.

Instead of focusing solely on existing power users, product teams should:
*   Understand the personas and motivations of current users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.
*   Identify the next wave of users and what prevents them from adopting the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.
*   "Dog food" the product as an adjacent user (e.g., creating a new account to experience the onboarding flow) to identify friction points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.
*   Observe and interview these potential users to understand their needs and how the product fits into their daily "jobs to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>.

For instance, at Instacart, understanding that users wanted to make "taco Tuesday" rather than just buy "tortillas, tomatoes, and avocado" led to a focus on the real "job to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Similarly, making it easier to reorder frequently purchased items had a massive impact on retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Lessons from Experience

### Instacart: Misaligned Expectations
Kaba identifies his time at Instacart as perhaps not his "best time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>. He joined with a vision for the product but realized he was out of sync with the company's DNA, which prioritized tactical, in-the-weeds operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. His desire to build systems and processes for institutionalizing work clashed with the immediate need for hands-on, rapid execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a>.

**Lesson:** Before taking a new role, conduct "understand work" not only with current employees but also with former employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>. Former employees often provide a "raw and different" perspective on the company culture and what is truly needed, helping to triangulate the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>.

### Instagram: Beyond Virality
While Instagram is often associated with virality and word-of-mouth growth, Kaba reveals that strategic partnerships and SEO were crucial early growth drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>:
*   **Celebrity Partnerships:** A savvy partnerships team taught celebrities how to use Instagram to tell their stories and build their brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. This set platform norms and generated media coverage, driving attention to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.
*   **SEO:** News articles linking to celebrity Instagram accounts and specific posts created a powerful SEO engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>. The launch of Instagram's web presence was critical, increasing growth by 10% and creating canonical SEO tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:44">[01:13:44]</a>.

Another key lesson from Instagram's growth was the "connections pivot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. Initially, the platform treated every follow equally, leading to new users following many celebrities but few friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. This resulted in users feeling isolated when they made their first posts, leading to churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. Prioritizing genuine "human connections" during onboarding, by ensuring new users connected with friends, fundamentally shifted retention and doubled it over 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

### Facebook: Cultural Context Matters
At Facebook, Kaba's team discovered that the people recommendation engine was "broken" in India, with users having fewer common friends compared to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>. Through intensive "understand work" involving on-the-ground visits to homes in Delhi and Mumbai, they found that Western-centric profile fields (like school or job title) were irrelevant in the local context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. Common names like "Amit Kumar" further complicated identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:49">[01:28:49]</a>. Users instead relied on photos to identify friends' cars or animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>.

**Lesson:** [[company_culture_and_remote_work | Cultural context]] profoundly impacts product usage and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:29:06]</a>. To build world-class, hyper-growth products that scale globally, one must be inclusive of diverse voices and learn from different cultural norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:16">[01:40:16]</a>.

By meticulously analyzing these factors and adopting Kaba's frameworks, individuals can make more informed career decisions and maximize their impact in any role.

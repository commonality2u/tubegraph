Ian McAllister spent 12 years at Amazon, a period he describes as foundational for building his product and [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | leadership toolbox]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. He observed that many employees stay at Amazon for extended periods, attributing this to the company's structured thinking, focus on measurable success, and continuous learning environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. The company's DNA, characterized by a "fitness function" or metric-driven approach, resonated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.

## Core Amazonian Principles and Culture

Amazon's culture fosters a "hundred heads down" mentality, though it was historically a "secretive" and "private" environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Key aspects of its culture and principles include:

*   **Impact-Driven**: The guiding light for employees, especially leaders, should be to wake up every day trying to have the biggest impact possible in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This focus on impact, rather than promotion or politics, naturally leads to career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.
*   **Structured Thinking & Communication**: Amazon values clear thinking and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This is reinforced through practices like writing detailed documents instead of slide decks, leading to richer discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement**: An operational mindset and rigor are crucial, not just for building new things but for effectively running existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. Paying close attention to product operations provides insights for improvements, doubling down on successes, or mitigating issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>.

## Lessons from Jeff Bezos

Ian McAllister had opportunities to present to Jeff Bezos, particularly during the development of Amazon Smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. His key takeaways from Bezos include:

*   **Encouragement**: Bezos was consistently encouraging, even when discussions didn't immediately yield solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.
*   **Focus on Problem**: Bezos taught the importance of having a clear problem statement. If a proposed concept lacked a "problem paragraph," he would suggest it wasn't solving a legitimate problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. This directly ties into the "working backwards" methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.
*   **Investment Criteria**: Bezos's criteria for investing in something new are three-fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>:
    1.  Is it a **big idea**? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>
    2.  Is it something **Amazon should be doing** (i.e., does it fit with the company's mission and capabilities)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>
    3.  Is there a **legitimate plan to succeed**? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a> All three must be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.

## Lessons from Jeff Wilkie

Jeff Wilkie, known internally as "Jaw," was considered the "consummate operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>. Ian McAllister highlights several aspects of Wilkie's [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | leadership]]:

*   **Operational Mindset and Rigor**: Wilkie fostered a strong operational muscle throughout the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. This involved a continuous improvement mindset and rigorous attention to how products already built are run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.
*   **Weekly Business Reviews (WBRs)**: Wilkie led the weekly business reviews, a crucial mechanism for accountability and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. These meetings involved reviewing key metrics across various business units, requiring leaders to be prepared to speak to variances and trends in their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. This cascaded down, encouraging teams to build similar muscles in understanding their own insights and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **"Tough Love" Approach**: Wilkie wasn't afraid to deliver "tough love" professionally and respectfully, which helped build immense respect from his team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.
*   **Teaching the "Why"**: Beyond making decisions, Wilkie excelled at teaching the "why" behind his decisions, sharing the mental models that informed his thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. This approach empowers individuals to apply lessons to future situations and fosters greater understanding and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

## The "Working Backwards" Process

The "working backwards" process is a fundamental aspect of product development at Amazon, designed to ensure customer obsession and problem-first thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.

### Core Concept: Problem Obsession
The essence of working backwards is to obsess about the problem first, allowing it to guide the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. The most common mistake teams make when attempting to adopt this process is starting with a solution they want to build and then retrofitting a problem to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. Ian McAllister's own early experience with a "Jeff project" called "ACIN to ACIN linking" taught him this lesson when the solution-first approach failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.

A tell-tale sign that a team isn't truly working backwards is if discussions begin by talking about "pieces in the pantry" â€“ existing technologies or services that *could* be combined, rather than a compelling customer problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

### Mechanism: The Press Release and FAQ (PR/FAQ)
While the core is problem-first thinking, Amazon enforces this through a specific mechanism: the internal press release and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.

*   **Press Release**: This document includes a problem paragraph, a solution paragraph, and a customer quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. It forces product managers to articulate the customer problem before detailing the solution.
*   **FAQ**: The FAQ section of the document assesses whether there is a "legitimate plan to succeed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>. This involves thinking through internal components, finances, technical hurdles, and other practical aspects of implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. It builds trust that the product manager has been thoughtful enough to deserve resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.

### Implementation and Adaptability
The PR/FAQ mechanism is effective for new and significant products due to its inherent overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. While Amazon often enforced these "working backwards reviews" as gates for approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>, the spirit of working backwards can be applied in various formats in other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>. Product leaders can adapt it to their team's processes, using documents to foster deeper discussions, even if the broader organization uses a different communication culture (e.g., slides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. The key is to consistently start with the problem you're trying to solve for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.

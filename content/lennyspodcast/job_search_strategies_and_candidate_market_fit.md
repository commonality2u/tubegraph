Phil Terry, author of "Never Search Alone," shares his insights on navigating the job market, emphasizing a "product lens" approach to job searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. His methods aim to help individuals find fulfilling careers, particularly in challenging economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Terry's background includes being part of the founding team of Amazon's first acquired company in the 90s and serving as CEO of Creative Good, a pioneering product and customer experience consulting firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Job Search Councils (JSC)

Job Search Councils are support groups comprising six to eight job seekers who commit to supporting each other throughout their job search process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This concept, emerging from the product community, is a core component of Terry's "Never Search Alone" methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Philosophy and Impact
Everyone, regardless of seniority, feels insecure and anxious during a job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Doing it alone magnifies these feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. JSCs are designed to flip this anxiety and fear into hope, motivation, accountability, and confidence by encouraging openness, vulnerability, and asking for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The most important thing to manage during a job search is one's emotional balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

Terry envisions JSCs as a private safety net addressing the negative unintended consequences of "creative destruction" inherent in capitalism, where new products and services disrupt old ones, leading to job insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

### Structure and Operation
*   **Application:** Individuals apply at phil.org <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Matching:** Applicants are matched into groups based on their status:
    *   **Slow Seekers:** Individuals currently employed but looking for a new job, having a slower pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   **Fast Seekers:** Individuals who are out of work and looking more actively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Moderators:** Each council needs a moderator, a job seeker who volunteers for the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Volunteering to moderate offers faster matching and additional training and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Meetings:** Councils typically meet twice a week for fast seekers and every two weeks for slow seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Resources:** Participants receive an orientation program, a 100-page workbook with templates, guides, and questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, and access to a Slack community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Cost:** JSCs are completely free, funded by Phil Terry's book sales and personal investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Candidate Market Fit (CMF)

[[Product Market Fit]] is a critical concept adapted for job seekers to understand their position in the job market, especially in a down market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. It's about recognizing that market conditions, like an abundance of supply (e.g., many product directors after layoffs), can push down the level of roles one might be a fit for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This is a market reality, not a personal failing, offering relief to job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

### The Manukan Two-Pager
The first step in defining CMF is to articulate what one wants and doesn't want in a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This is known as the "Manukan Two-Pager," named after Allison Manukan, who developed it within one of Terry's product councils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. Most people, especially when laid off, tend to "spray and pray" with job applications rather than thinking strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. This initial "slow down to go fast" approach helps define a clear strategy, similar to how product people approach new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. The draft is shared within the job search council for feedback and refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

### The Listening Tour
After drafting the Manukan Two-Pager, individuals embark on a "listening tour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Since the job seeker is the "product" (skills and experience) in the market, this tour gathers [[Strategies for achieving productmarket fit | customer feedback]] on their fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

Types of conversations during the listening tour:
*   **Reverse Exit Interviews:** Conversations with former colleagues to understand strengths and fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
*   **Broader Network:** Asking trusted friends and connections for their perspective on fit, especially using the "golden question": "If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Recruiters:** Engaging recruiters by asking for their advice on fit, rather than immediately asking for a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. Building relationships with recruiters even when not actively looking is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

The listening tour helps refine the Manukan Two-Pager, provides market research on what the market wants, and creates "listening posts" â€“ a network of people invested in the job seeker's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. This process can be challenging, as feedback might be hard or even inappropriate (e.g., sexist comments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. The job search council helps parse and interpret this feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.

### Narrowing the Focus
A key principle of [[identifying_and_targeting_best_fit_customers | Candidate Market Fit]] is to define a very narrow, clear focus, similar to how product people aim for a specific audience (a "spear" not a "net") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. This focus typically involves three to four attributes like stage of company, industry, level of role, function, and desired culture (e.g., "director of product role in a healthcare series B startup in San Francisco") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

The counter-intuitive benefit of a narrow focus is that it allows others to be expansive on your behalf; they can identify related opportunities that you might fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. A broad statement like "I'll take any product job" is forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. Once the CMF statement is finalized and approved by the council, it should be shared with the listening tour network and posted on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.

This CMF can and should iterate as market conditions change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. For example, in the current tech market, more jobs exist in startups than in established companies due to recent layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. Sometimes, a "two-step strategy" is necessary, accepting a lower-level or different role (e.g., from EVP to Individual Contributor) to gain experience closer to the "technology frontier" and enable future advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

## Playing to Win

Phil Terry advocates for a proactive, "play to win" mindset during interviews and negotiations, rather than passively "playing not to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.

### Job Mission with OKRs
Instead of solely relying on often-poor job descriptions, candidates should privately create their own "job mission with OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)" for the role they are interviewing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. This document outlines what the candidate believes they will be accountable for and the outcomes they plan to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

Benefits of this approach:
*   **Develops Interview Questions:** Drafting the job mission helps generate insightful questions to ask the hiring manager, demonstrating engagement and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
*   **Impresses Hiring Managers:** After a few interviews, sharing this draft (preferably live, not via email) with the hiring manager shows proactivity and a deep understanding of the role, often leading to immediate positive impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. An Amazon executive noted that if someone did this, it would "blow my mind" and lead to a hire on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.
*   **Clarifies Expectations:** It helps both parties ensure they are aligned on the role's responsibilities, preventing "Job A turning into Job B" scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>.
*   **Signals Initiative:** It demonstrates initiative, accountability, and the ability to make things happen, differentiating the candidate from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

### Negotiation Strategies
The job mission with OKRs also sets the stage for effective negotiation by framing requests around success in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>.
*   **Focus on Success Enablers:** Before discussing salary, candidates should discuss resources and support needed to achieve the defined OKRs, such as budget for addressing technical debt, training for the team, or additional hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. This shows commitment to the company's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. If the company is unwilling to support these needs, it's a "huge red flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.
*   **Asking for More Money:** Even in a tough market, candidates should ask for more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>. Phrasing it as "Are you open to [desired amount]?" makes the request low-risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. Most of the time, companies are open to further discussion or a slight increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.
*   **Live Conversations:** Whenever possible, discussions about the job mission and negotiations should be held in person or over the phone with the hiring manager, rather than via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. This fosters better relationships and allows for back-channel support from recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.

## Asking for Help

Asking for help is a transformative yet often resisted aspect of career development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Phil Terry attributes much of his success to learning this skill from his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>.

### Counter-Intuitive Rules of Asking for Help
1.  **Not a Sign of Weakness:** Asking for help requires and strengthens confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>. Senior leaders consistently credit asking for help for their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>.
2.  **A Giving Activity:** When done well, asking for help provides the helper with a sense of purpose and value, making it a mutually beneficial exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>. People feel "given to" when their expertise is valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>.
3.  **Leads to Independence:** Engaging others for help paradoxically fosters greater independence and accountability, enabling a more effective job search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>.
4.  **Improves Reputation:** It builds trust and strengthens relationships, improving one's professional reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>.

### How to Ask for Help Effectively
*   **Do Your Homework:** Avoid "asking poorly" by expecting others to do the work for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>. Be thoughtful and prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.
*   **Be Open and Vulnerable:** Authenticity encourages others to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.
*   **Respect Relationships:** Understand the context of the relationship before asking for a favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.
*   **Be Honest:** Clearly state what you are asking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>.
*   **Leverage Councils:** JSCs provide a safe space to practice asking for help and receive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>.

Examples of asking for help:
*   "Defining reality" by seeking diverse perspectives on a situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.
*   Reviewing emails or documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>.
*   Conducting "peer coaching calls" for specific challenges or career evolution, such as a "first 90 days call" when starting a new job or a "career evolution call" to transition roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>.

## Other Key Strategies and Advice

*   **Manage Emotional Balance:** Beyond resumes and networking, managing one's emotional state is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.
*   **The Gratitude House Exercise:** Before the listening tour, reflect on everyone who has helped you. This reminds you that you are not alone and builds confidence for interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.
*   **Debrief Interviews:** Talk through interviews immediately afterward with someone else to accurately parse what happened and counter inner critic narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.
*   **Name Your Inner Critic:** Recognize that your inner critic is often lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.
*   **Consistent Updates:** Send monthly update notes to your network, even if there's no major news, to maintain engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:44">[01:43:44]</a>.
*   **Stay Active:** Do not become passive in your job search, especially in tough markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>.
*   **Back-Channel Reference Checks:** When evaluating a potential boss or company, do your own back-channel checks through your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>. A powerful question for reference checking is: "I'm about to hire Lenny. If it would be a huge mistake if I didn't bring him on, call me back. Otherwise, don't bother." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:49">[01:43:49]</a>.
*   **Read Widely:** Phil Terry recommends reading widely, especially books that challenge perspective, as "books are machines to think with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>. He recommends "Creative Destruction" for understanding economic dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:42">[01:38:42]</a>, and "The Manual" (on Stoicism) for emotional resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:21">[01:40:21]</a>. He also recommends deeply studying authors like Marty Cagan as if they were a mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:49">[01:39:49]</a>.
*   **Develop Mentors:** Seek out "dead or distant mentors" by deeply studying individuals you admire (e.g., Steve Jobs, Warren Buffett) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24">[01:35:24]</a>.

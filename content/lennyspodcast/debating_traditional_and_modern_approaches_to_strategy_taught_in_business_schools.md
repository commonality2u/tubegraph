Strategy is considered an intellectually challenging and emotionally intimidating activity, which contributes to why many people struggle with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. A significant factor in this struggle is the quality of strategy education, particularly in Business Schools, which is often described as "generally sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## The Flaws in Current Strategy Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

According to Roger Martin, the prevailing approach to strategy taught in Business Schools has become "crazy theoretical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This shift is largely attributed to the widespread adoption of the **Resource-Based View of the Firm (RBVF)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### The Resource-Based View of the Firm (RBVF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>

The RBVF is criticized as a "silly" and "dumb theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a> that was largely embraced by academics out of "jealousy" of [[Secondorder thinking and philosophical approaches in business | Mike Porter's]] prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

Key criticisms of RBVF include:
*   **Caricaturing Michael Porter's work**: Proponents of RBVF distorted Porter's "positioning school" as being "all about finding a place that is structurally attractive and then milking it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, implying a static view of competition, which Porter himself never asserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **Focus on resources without direction**: RBVF posits that strategy is "all about building resources," akin to "if you build it they will come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. However, it fails to provide guidance on *what* resources to invest in or how to think through those decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Lack of practical application**: The theory is rarely used in the real world; Roger Martin, with 42 years of consulting experience, claims to have seen it applied only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Academic gatekeeping**: In many top Business Schools (with the possible exception of Harvard Business School), aspiring professors must "swear allegiance" to the RBVF to be hired, indicating a rigid "loyalty test" in academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Roger Martin's Approach: The Strategy Choice Cascade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>

In contrast to the dominant academic approach, Roger Martin advocates for a practical, integrated framework he calls the **Strategy Choice Cascade** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. This framework, developed over years of work, addresses the question of *how* to create a strategy that [[understanding the challenges of developing effective business strategies | compels desired customer action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

The Strategy Choice Cascade consists of five interconnected questions:

1.  **What is your winning aspiration?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>
    *   This defines what the organization aims to accomplish, providing context for subsequent choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Ideally, it's framed in terms of how customers will benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

2.  **Where will you play?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>
    *   This question defines the playing field, considering factors like target customers, product scope (finished product vs. component), and distribution channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. It also involves vertical stage choices within the value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

3.  **How will you win?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>
    *   This addresses [[differentiating between playing to play and playing to win in business strategy | how to achieve competitive advantage]]. The two primary routes are:
        *   **Lowest cost provider**: Achieving a significantly lower cost structure than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. This often requires dominant scale within the operating territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
        *   **Differentiation**: Creating unique customer value that makes customers prefer your offering over competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. This means the customer won't "flip a coin" between your product and a competitor's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Simply being "better" is not enough; the differentiation must be hard to replicate quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

4.  **What [[the role of capabilities and management systems in strategy | capabilities]] must you have in place to win?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>
    *   These are the internal strengths that enable the "how to win" theory to become a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>. These capabilities should be difficult for competitors to replicate, forming a "moat" around the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. They represent what competitors "can't do" or "won't do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.

5.  **What [[the role of capabilities and management systems in strategy | Management Systems]] are required to make sure the capabilities are in place?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>
    *   These are the systems and processes that build and maintain the necessary capabilities over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. They ensure the chosen capabilities persist and evolve, reinforcing the competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.

This integrated approach emphasizes that all five questions must "fit together and reinforce one another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Strategy Thinkers

Roger Martin positions his framework in relation to other prominent strategy thinkers:
*   **Michael Porter**: Martin sees Porter's work as defining what a good strategy *looks like* (e.g., differentiated or low cost), but lacking a clear *process* for how to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
*   **Hamilton Helmer**: Martin notes that Helmer's "Seven Powers" (types of competitive advantage) fit well within the "how to win" box of his cascade, offering categories for achieving victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Helmer's concept of "counterpositioning," where a competitor cannot replicate your strategy due to their existing business structure, aligns with finding "fault lines" that make it painful for rivals to cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.
*   **Richard Rumelt**: Martin expresses skepticism about Rumelt's "hypercompetition" theory, viewing it as an attempt to "blast Mike Porter" by misrepresenting Porter's views on competitive stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. Martin suggests Rumelt's work lacks practical business understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>.

## [[Becoming more strategic | Becoming More Strategic]] Through Betterment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>

For individuals feeling overwhelmed by strategy, Martin suggests focusing on "betterment over perfection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>. This means treating strategy as a problem-solving tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>, specifically addressing the "single most painful gap" between current and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>.

By identifying such a gap, one can apply the Strategy Choice Cascade to consider what different choices could be made in terms of aspiration, where to play, how to win, capabilities, and management systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. This iterative approach of tackling one gap at a time leads to continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>.

Ultimately, Roger Martin asserts that there is no "mythical beast called a great natural strategist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. Great strategists, like A.G. Lafley, are simply those who "practice" strategy consistently over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. The key is to start making different choices to solve problems now, rather than waiting for an ideal moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>.

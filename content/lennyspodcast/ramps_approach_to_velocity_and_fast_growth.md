Ramp, recognized as the fastest-growing SaaS business in history, has achieved remarkable success by prioritizing velocity and first principles in its product development and overall company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The company reached over $100 million in annual run rate in just two years, a feat accomplished with approximately 50 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Unprecedented Growth

Ramp's impressive [[company_growth_and_scaling_challenges | growth]] trajectory includes:
*   Hitting $100 million in annual revenue within its first two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   Growing to hit $600 million in savings for customers this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   Crossing $10 billion in analyzed spending on its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   Serving 15,000 businesses by automating finance functions like expense management, card payments, bill payments, and accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Jeff Charles, VP of Product at Ramp, highlights that the "recipe" for this success is moving quickly, thinking from first principles, and empowering individual team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Core Principle: Velocity

At Ramp, velocity is paramount; it dictates product development, team incentives, hiring, promotion, decision-making, and organizational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This focus originated during the pandemic when a small team faced a vast market opportunity, making execution speed crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Velocity is seen as a key metric for team performance, as high-velocity teams can achieve impact through continuous iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. It also attracts top talent, as many join Ramp specifically to experience fast building and shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. High velocity also de-risks decisions by making the cost of those decisions low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Examples of Ramp's Velocity
*   Within three months of Jeff Charles joining, a team of eight engineers built a competitor to MX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   Six months later, they built a competitor to Expensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   A team of three engineers, one designer, and one product manager built a competitor to Bill.com in three months, now moving billions of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Operationalizing Velocity

Ramp achieves its high velocity through several key strategies:

### 1. Small, Single-Threaded Teams
Teams are kept small with a "single-threaded" focus, meaning each individual has one primary goal to wake up and focus on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This requires removing all other distractions or requests, allowing hyper-focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. For example, a single-threaded team was solely focused on building the "Flex" product for e-commerce companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### 2. Shielding Teams from Chaos
Product Managers (PMs) and other leaders actively protect core teams from external chaos.
*   **Production Engineers** are on a rotational program to shield core teams from escalations, bugs, and issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Product Operators** protect PMs from tasks like documentation, release management, and customer requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   New product teams are typically formed by pulling individuals from different existing teams, ensuring they have no responsibilities on existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   Teams are "shielded from the chaos that is the rest of the organization" until they achieve [[growth_strategies_and_achieving_productmarket_fit_in_startups | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### 3. Lofty Goals and Design-Driven Motivation
Ramp sets ambitious goals, often looking at publicly traded competitors like Bill.com and Expensify as market comparables to motivate teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Design plays a crucial role, with significant time spent crafting visionary prototypes that excite and anchor teams on the future product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The company is very revenue-driven, using market and revenue goals to maintain momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### 4. Empowering Product Teams (Context Over Control)
Instead of micromanaging solutions, Ramp focuses on aligning teams around goals, hypotheses, and supporting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Senior leaders provide context rather than prescriptive solutions, trusting that teams closer to the ground can devise better solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. The leadership's role is to repeatedly share context, ensuring teams focus on the right goals and data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

> "Whenever things went wrong at Ramp, it was when I was being prescriptive with regards to the solution without actually explaining and aligning upstream on the goal, the hypothesis and the data." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>

The "contract" between leaders and teams is their strategy and roadmap, which they align on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Teams are expected to highlight risks and one-way decisions requiring input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

### 5. Streamlined Planning and Minimal Meetings
Ramp views extensive planning as a hindrance to execution.
> "Any second you spend planning is a second you don't spend doing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>

*   They shifted from quarterly planning that took one month (33% of the time) to a bi-annual, one-page document outlining company priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
*   Accuracy in planning is reserved for high-value activities, such as major marketing moments or product launches that require cross-functional coordination, which are a small percentage of total R&D focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.
*   Meetings are strictly for collaboration, ideation, and decision-making, not status updates, which are done asynchronously in real-time systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

### 6. Managing Quality with High Velocity
Counterintuitively, Ramp finds that quality increases with product velocity because issues can be fixed quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Control mechanisms ensure high velocity doesn't compromise the business:
*   **Voice of Customer Process**: Every negative review is shared monthly with the tech lead, PM, and designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Metrics**: NPS, CSAT, and "operational overhead" (percentage of tickets from a product area normalized by user count) are regularly reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. Teams are expected to maintain low operational burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **Bug Resolution**: Bugs are fixed as soon as they are surfaced, and direct ownership is given to engineers on call to "feel the pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **User Confusion**: If support tickets due to user confusion are elevated, teams cannot ship new features until these issues are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

## Avoiding Burnout in a Fast-Paced Culture

Jeff Charles believes velocity can help avoid burnout. Burnout often occurs when effort is put into things that aren't moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. High velocity helps people stay in a "flow state" where work is thrilling, not a chore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   Organizations often make it hard to achieve this flow state with distractions and excessive meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.
*   The key is for work to be meaningful to the individual, not just their superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. Management's role is to ensure every team member feels ownership of their goals, like running their "mini company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.

## Thinking from First Principles

Ramp's unique business model—combining credit card, payments, and software for SMBs and enterprises—requires thinking from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. This means going back to fundamentals rather than pattern-matching past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
*   It requires hiring individuals who can set aside prior experience and think deeply about novel problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
*   An example is their support team, which reports directly to product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. The first principle was: "Every support ticket is a failure of our product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This led to hiring agents focused on decreasing ticket volume and increasing deflection, resulting in an "extremely low contact rate" with over 400,000 users supported by fewer than 30 agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

## Empowering and Optimizing Product Teams

Ramp aims to maximize output with fewer PMs by distributing aspects of the PM role across the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.
*   **Empowering Everyone**: The goal is to make everyone—engineers, designers, data scientists—"think like PMs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. Designers are empowered to think about specs and priorities, and engineers are expected to take high-level directions and think through them deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.
*   **Product Operations**: A dedicated Product Operations team handles operational functions such as project management, issue management, release management, and content enablement, freeing up PMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.
*   **Cutting Low-Leverage Work**: PMs at Ramp don't write tickets. Their contract is the vision and a high-level spec; engineers are accountable for breaking down and driving projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.

The core PM job at Ramp includes:
*   Team building and fostering culture within the pod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.
*   Ensuring the team is focused on key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.
*   Protecting the team from stakeholders and being the central point of contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

## Hiring for Velocity

Ramp seeks individuals with a strong desire for impact and the ability to think deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.
*   **Desire for Impact**: They look for candidates who have left previous roles because things became "too slow" or "too bureaucratic," preferring to build and ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.
*   **Deep Thinking**: Interviewers delve deep into past decisions and trade-offs to assess how candidates approach problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.
*   **Beyond Experience**: While experience is considered, Ramp prioritizes "hunger" and the ability to think deeply, as their unique business reduces the impact of prior experience alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.
*   **Engineers' Qualities**: A-plus engineers demonstrate a desire to win in the market, understand business context, ask questions beyond engineering, execute without micromanagement, and proactively help resolve issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. They set the pace and push PMs to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.

## Leadership and Culture

Leaders at Ramp foster velocity by:
*   **Investing in R&D**: Ensuring R&D is a first-class citizen, paying top market rates, hiring the best talent, and focusing on the engineering and tech brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.
*   **CEO's Role**: The CEO sets the vision but is less opinionated about the specific execution sequence, trusting the empowered tech organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   **Eliminating Waste**: Identifying and removing time-wasting activities like excessive meetings and status updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
*   **Clear Trade-offs**: PMs must clearly communicate trade-offs to leadership, presenting a "menu of items" rather than trying to achieve everything simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.
*   **Recognition**: Leaders actively acknowledge and praise work on random project channels and design critiques, which motivates engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

### Strategic Consistency amid Chaos
Despite the internal "chaos" often present in hyper-growth startups, Ramp maintains a consistent long-term vision. Their strategy has consistently been to be "the spend management platform that helps you spend less" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. While specific timings and quarterly scopes may change, the core vision, value, and problem remain consistent, preventing teams from feeling like leaders are constantly changing their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

## Writing as a Thinking Tool

Jeff Charles emphasizes writing as a critical tool for deep thinking and problem-solving. When faced with a complex problem, he advocates:
1.  Shutting down the laptop and taking out paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.
2.  Writing the question as simply as possible at the top of the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.
3.  Spending time thinking and writing out the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.

> "If you're able to write things clearly, you're able to think through things clearly." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>

This process helps clarify thoughts, especially for scalability problems with no clear answers. It also serves as an effective communication tool and helps build thought leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. PMs, with their time available for strategic thought, can leverage this by blocking out "deep work" time for focused thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

## Personal Productivity Tips

To maintain focus and organization, Jeff Charles recommends:
*   **Robust Task Management**: At the end of every meeting, clearly write down tasks owed by oneself and others, along with due dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.
*   **Grooming Tasks**: Group tasks into logical chunks (tactical vs. strategic, important vs. less important) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>.
*   **Offloading Memory**: Use systems to record information rather than relying on memory, freeing up headspace for processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.
*   **Strategic Calendar Use**: Align daily calendars with set goals, grouping similar tasks and blocking out time for deep strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.
*   **Minimize Distractions**: Turn off notifications, quit Slack during deep work, and check emails only once a day for a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>.
*   **Master Tools**: Become proficient with tools like Slack, email, and calendar, as they are crucial for efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

Will Larson, CTO at Carta and author, shares insights on evolving [[the_role_of_engineers_in_senior_leadership_positions | engineering leadership]] and the critical importance of strategy in today's market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape for Engineers and Leaders

The market has shifted significantly from the "zero interest rate era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Previously, engineering leaders often spent half or more of their time on hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Now, with fewer interviews and a different market, other competencies are becoming more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Leaders must now get "deeper into the details" and understand team sizing and allocation, a change from an era where teams primarily grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

A key shift is the opportunity to treat engineers as peers and place them in truly [[the_role_of_managers_in_senior_leadership_positions | senior leadership roles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Historically, engineers were sometimes "coddled" or "sheltered" from real problems, which was detrimental to their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The previous era's focus on hiring and retention led to middle management coddling engineers to avoid losing team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The current environment allows for holding engineers accountable, which in turn enables their placement in senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Systems Thinking in Practice

[[first_principles_thinking_in_leadership_and_entrepreneurship | Systems thinking]] involves understanding "stocks and flows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Stocks are things that accumulate (e.g., number of fish in a lake, number of people fishing), and flows are the movement between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This approach helps in modeling reality to improve diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

A challenge with [[first_principles_thinking_in_leadership_and_entrepreneurship | systems thinking]] is when people believe "reality is wrong" if it conflicts with their model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Reality is always right; the model is always wrong if it conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Applying Systems Thinking to a Hiring Pipeline

To apply [[first_principles_thinking_in_leadership_and_entrepreneurship | systems thinking]] to a hiring pipeline:
*   **Stocks:** Potential candidates, sourced candidates, candidates in different interview stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Flows:** Conversion rates between stages (e.g., from sourced to recruiter screen, recruiter screen to hiring manager screen, offer stage to accepted offer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

By analyzing these stocks and flows, you can identify where the biggest issues are, such as:
*   Hiring managers not extending offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   Offers being extended but not accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   Not enough candidates entering the pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

This helps in making data-driven decisions to fix problems rather than relying on intuition alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Engineering Strategy

Every function, including engineering, inherently has a strategy, even if it's not written down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. The first rule of [[understanding_strategy_and_its_challenges | strategy]] is to write it down to enable improvement and debug inconsistencies in its application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

### Characteristics of Good Strategy
*   **Often Boring:** Good strategies are often unexciting but highly effective because they focus energy on what the company truly values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Examples include:
    *   **"We only use the tools we have today":** This prevents engineers from constantly introducing new technologies and instead focuses them on building features with the existing "standard kit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
    *   **Uber's "own data centers" policy:** This allowed rapid expansion into geopolitically complex regions like China, unconstrained by cloud provider presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
    *   **Stripe's "Ruby monolith" policy:** This focused engineers on innovating for users rather than building tooling for diverse programming languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   **Dictates Investment:** The goal of good [[the_role_of_strategy_in_product_leadership | strategy]] is not to appease everyone, but to dictate how limited resources are invested in problems that matter to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
*   **Focuses on Constraints:** A common theme in effective strategies is the decision to constrain options to move faster and focus on what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
*   **Richard Rumelt's Definition:** A strategy has three components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>:
    1.  **Diagnosis:** A clear understanding of the current status quo and existing realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
    2.  **Guiding Policies:** How to address the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
    3.  **Actions:** Concrete steps to implement those guiding policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.
    *   Bad [[product_strategy_and_vision_development | strategy]] often stems from a "willful disbelief" of an accurate diagnosis, leading to incoherent policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.

### Developing Strategy Skills
To get better at [[building_strategy_skills_and_effective_goals | strategy]] in general, and engineering strategy specifically, it's recommended to read:
*   *Good Strategy Bad Strategy* by Richard Rumelt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
*   *Thinking in Systems* by Donella Meadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.
*   *Technology Strategy Patterns* by Evan Bottcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   *The Value Flywheel Effect* by David Anderson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   *The Phoenix Project* by Gene Kim and Kevin Behr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.
Will Larson also addresses [[developing_a_product_strategy | strategy]] in his books, *Staff Engineer* and the upcoming *The Engineering Executive's Primer* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

## Engineering and Product Management Collaboration

The core problems in [[engineering_and_product_management_collaboration | EM-PM pairs]] often boil down to misaligned incentives or a lack of understanding of each other's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.
*   **Misaligned Incentives:** While often oversimplified as "the PM wants promotion," the reality is complex, stemming from broader business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.
*   **Lack of Understanding:** Before trying to solve a conflict, ensure a deep understanding of what the other person truly cares about. Often, a compromise solution that satisfies everyone's real needs can be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>.

### Fostering Better Collaboration
A powerful approach is for EM-PM pairs to have the *same performance rating*, fostering shared incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. This requires calibrating performance reviews between the respective functional heads (e.g., Head of Product and CTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. This system, sometimes extended to include business leadership (a "trifecta"), holds all parties accountable for evaluating and solving the entire set of constraints, not just their functional ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.

A common stressor for engineering managers is the pressure to provide their team with "interesting work" while also meeting product demands, which can lead to friction with product managers who may not have visibility into this internal constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Measuring Engineering Productivity

Measuring [[developing_a_product_strategy | engineering productivity]] is increasingly important, especially when teams are being reduced or VCs are pushing for efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.

### Approaches to Measurement
1.  **Benchmarking:** Comparing R&D or engineering spend against industry benchmarks from VC funds can provide a defensible answer to boards, but it doesn't offer insight into organizational effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.
2.  **Talking to Engineers:** Engineers often know if their teams are effective and why. Their complaints can provide "crumbs" to trace and diagnose underlying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
3.  **Aligning with Business Goals:** Engineering evaluation should be wholly accountable to product and business goals, demonstrating how engineering supports customer value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
4.  **Showcasing the Roadmap:** Regularly presenting a roadmap of "meaningful, meaty things that have impact" and explaining that impact can build confidence and space with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.
5.  **DORA Metrics:** Influential metrics from *Accelerate* by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, and Jez Humble (lead time, incident remediation time, change failure rate, deployment frequency) are good for *diagnosis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. While not perfect for direct evaluation, they can be a "good enough starting place" for reporting to leadership, providing an opportunity to educate them on nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

It's crucial to get comfortable with measuring something, even if it's imperfect. Experts often rule out all measures due to perceived inaccuracies, leading to measuring nothing. Instead, use imperfect metrics as a starting point to educate stakeholders about the rich data underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.

## Company Values

When defining company or organizational values:
*   **Honesty:** Values must genuinely reflect what the company *actually* does, not just what it aspires to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. "Users first" is a great Amazon value, but only if the company's decisions truly reflect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.
*   **Applicability:** Values should be actionable and help guide real decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>. For example, "optimize globally" (Stripe) versus "do what's good for your team and ignore everyone else" (Uber) are opposing but applicable values that influence daily operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>.
*   **Reversibility:** A good value should have an opposite that *could* logically exist, even if it's undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. Values like "we build good software" or "we solve customer problems that matter" are "identity values" – they describe who a company wants to be, but are not useful for decision-making because their reversal is unthinkable for any company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.
*   **Hiring Filter:** Effective values should clarify who doesn't fit within the company's culture, serving as a hiring filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>.

## Learning from Failure: The Dig Rewrite

Will Larson recounts the challenging rewrite of Dig version 4, a decision made before he joined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. The goal was to add social functionality to compete with social networks like Twitter and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.

The rewrite, a "decision that never works out for anyone," led to the site crashing constantly upon launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. It took a month to get the site fully functional, with user features not working properly for much of that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. A core bug causing servers to need restarting every 12 hours was eventually traced to a subtle Python variable initiation issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.

Despite the heroic effort to get the site running, the company eventually went to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>. This experience, though grim at the time, was a powerful learning moment that shaped his entire career, providing an early opportunity to manage an entire engineering team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

The ultimate demise of Dig was largely due to an SEO change from Google that reduced traffic to their monetized permalink pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>. While the product idea of social news based on friends' readings remains compelling, many have struggled to make it a successful business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>.

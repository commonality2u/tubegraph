Melton Quran Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, shares insights on establishing and expanding a growth team, focusing on early-stage prioritization, effective hiring strategies, and team structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Early Days Prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>

In the early stages, it's crucial to go back to basics, building the "skeleton before putting on the makeup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Melton advises a step-by-step approach to growth investments:
1.  **Website Presence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>:
    *   Ensure a website exists and is fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
    *   Verify that search engines recognize its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
    *   Confirm people can find it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
    *   If not, create content to improve discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  **Foundation First** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>: A successful paid ads program cannot run effectively if the website loads slowly (e.g., four-plus seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
3.  **Prioritize Low-Cost Channels**: Start with cost-effective methods like tapping into communities (e.g., Reddit, Quora) and content/SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   The focus should be on solving problems and providing value, not direct selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
    *   This "cheap channel" strategy accounted for 80-90% of Deel's early growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

> "You can't run a successful paid ads program if you have a website that's loading in four plus seconds, so really going back to the basics and starting from a good experience at the core and then expanding step by step from there is how I would suggest everybody starts and that's what I would do if I was to get hired all over again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>

## [[hiring_for_growth_roles | Hiring for Growth Roles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>

When [[hiring_for_growth_roles | hiring for growth roles]], Melton emphasizes key qualities and considerations:

*   **Commitment to Bottom-Line KPIs**: Candidates should be willing to commit to closed-won revenue goals, not just lead numbers, demonstrating care for the business's bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. Ask about their past KPIs and what they believe their KPIs *should* be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **Adaptability and Resourcefulness**: Be wary of hiring from large companies if they are not used to operating with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.
*   **"Little Hands" Concept**: Deel values individuals at all levels who are willing to engage in "nitty-gritty work" and not shy away from the smallest tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. This means a willingness to do the "tiniest of jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>.
*   **Case Study Assessment**: During interviews, ask candidates to devise strategies with varying budgets (e.g., $0, $10,000, $100,000) to gauge their ability to scale and commit to metrics at different spending levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
*   **Sincerity and Self-Awareness**: Use questions like "What would your siblings say about you?" to assess sincerity and self-awareness, looking for humbleness rather than overly perfect self-descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>.

## Growth Team Structure and Evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>

### Early Team Composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>
Deel's early growth team was built by hiring one leader to manage a part of the organization, allowing them to grow their teams from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. The first hires were:
1.  **Product Marketing Person**: Responsible for sitting between the product team and go-to-market teams to set messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.
2.  **Copywriter**: Hired to assist with messaging and tone, eventually leading creative teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.
3.  **Data Analyst**: An early and critical hire (number three on the growth team) to ensure that every dollar spent was tracked and understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.
4.  **Content Person**: Already at Deel before Melton joined, indicating early recognition of content's importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.

### Current Team Structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>
Deel now operates with a combination of regional and functional teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>:
*   **Functional Teams**: Composed of subject matter experts (e.g., product marketing, content, community, events, paid advertising, brand) who can be based anywhere in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. This structure allows for collective learning and faster skill development among technical roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **Regional Teams**: Include marketing managers for different key regions, who collaborate with functional teams to execute strategies and ensure local expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. Regional teams work with the central functional teams to run localized campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.

### Content Team Example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>
The content team, which drives approximately 50% of Deel's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>, consists of about eight full-time people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. It's led by a director and includes:
*   An operations person managing freelancers, briefs, fact-checking, and publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   Specialists focused on different product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
*   A team dedicated to new content mediums beyond written articles, such as video and educational content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

## Core Values and Culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>

Deel's culture is built on what team members bring and what the company gives back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>:

*   **Deal Speed**: A core value emphasizing urgency in addressing customer problems and building products quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. The team aims to solve customer problems within 24 hours and build products in a fraction of the time competitors would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.
*   **Default Optimism**: Maintaining a positive outlook, where people ask "I think it's going to work for these four reasons" instead of focusing on why something won't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>.
*   **Customer Centricity**: Deep care for the customer, recognizing the personal impact of their product on people's livelihoods and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.
*   **Flexibility and Freedom**: In return for these commitments, the company offers flexibility in choosing how and when they work, allowing team members to set up their lives as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.

These values, while intense, were organically developed from everyday practices and publicly shared about a year into the company's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. Melton highlights the importance of values reflecting who a company *is*, rather than who it *hopes to be* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.

[!NOTE] Melton emphasizes that a strong product is at the core of successful growth strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. Acquisition channels are ineffective if the product doesn't meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. Deel's early team composition, heavily weighted towards product and engineers, signaled a strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

Independence in business operations, as exemplified by 37signals (creators of Basecamp and Hey), presents a distinct alternative to the widely publicized venture capital-backed "go big or go home" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This approach prioritizes long-term sustainability, profitability, and the founders' ability to shape the company according to their vision, rather than external demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.

## Characteristics of an Independent Business

Independent businesses, like 37signals, operate without external investors or a board of directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. They typically have no plans to go public or sell the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. Their primary focus is on generating profit, not just revenue or rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Profitability Over Revenue
For 37signals, the key metric is profit, not revenue, because a company can generate high revenue and still go broke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. 37signals has been profitable for 24 years straight, achieving double-digit million-dollar profits annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This profit directly benefits founders and employees due to the absence of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Autonomy and Control
Independence grants the founders the freedom to make decisions without seeking permission, turning the business into a flexible "all-terrain vehicle" capable of going anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the Venture Capital (VC) route, where the singular outcome is to "go huge," often forcing companies to ignore profitable niche opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Advantages of Independence

*   **Financial Fulfillment**: Bootstrapping can be more fulfilling, fun, and even more lucrative for founders, as profits filter down to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>.
*   **Freedom to Experiment**: Healthy margins allow for [[Experimentation and decisionmaking in business growth | experimentation]] and playing with ideas without fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Focus**: The business can be designed as an "infinite game," where the goal is to continue doing enjoyable work for as long as possible, rather than pursuing a finite exit like an IPO or sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This aligns with the concept of a "stayup" – a company focused on enduring, rather than just starting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:18">[02:00:18]</a>.
*   **Avoids External Pressure**: Independent businesses are not beholden to external timeframes or expectations from investors, reducing the pressure to constantly grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This allows for flexibility and the ability to pivot without needing approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
*   **True Entrepreneurship**: For Jason Fried, being an entrepreneur means working for oneself, which is compromised when taking large investments and becoming beholden to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.

## Operational Principles of Independent Businesses

Operating independently often fosters unique and efficient ways of working, prioritizing [[Balancing startup agility and big company operations | simplicity]], focused effort, and internal satisfaction.

### Small Teams, High Efficiency
37signals operates with around 75 employees, serving over 100,000 customers and making tens of millions in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. In contrast, competitors like Slack have thousands of employees but may not achieve profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. This efficiency is achieved by:

*   **Focus on Core Products**: Avoiding complex offerings or catering to diverse enterprise needs, which would necessitate large sales and support teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. For example, Basecamp has one price for unlimited users, simplifying product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **[[Experimentation and decisionmaking in business growth | Shape Up Methodology]]**: An internally developed framework for product development, detailed at basecamp.com/shapeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. Key elements include:
    *   **Appetites, Not Estimates**: Projects are given a fixed time budget (e.g., a maximum of six weeks), forcing teams to find the simplest, most effective solution within that constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. Work expands to fill the time available, so fixing the time prevents endless projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
    *   **Two-Person Teams**: Each feature is developed by one programmer and one designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
    *   **Cool-down Periods**: After each six-week cycle, a two-week cool-down period allows for internal freelancing, bug fixing, and non-scheduled work, preventing burnout from continuous "sprints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>.

### Intuition-Driven Decision-Making
Decisions at 37signals are heavily influenced by gut, instinct, and feeling rather than strict data analysis or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. This stems from the belief that:

*   **All Decisions are Judgment Calls**: Even data-driven choices are ultimately interpreted by humans, who bring a myriad of known and unknown influences to bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.
*   **Value of Experience**: Like hiring executives for their "judgment and experience," trust is placed in individuals' accumulated insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
*   **Fostering Internal Trust**: By demonstrating trust in intuition at the leadership level, space is created for others on the team to make similar judgment-based decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. Questions like "How does this feel?" are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **Hiring for Instinct**: During hiring, particularly for designers and product people, candidates are asked to "riff on the spot" and demonstrate their raw instincts and taste, rather than just perfect execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

### No Long-Term Planning
The company avoids multi-year or even six-month plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. Work is planned in six-week cycles, allowing for adaptability and avoiding the "obligations in the future" that can lead to unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>. This "making it up as we go" approach is seen as the healthiest and most honest way to run a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

### "Work Isn't War"
37signals rejects the use of war metaphors in business, such as "conquering markets" or "destroying competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. This language is seen as depressing and counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>. The focus is instead on creation, pride, and existing by providing valuable alternatives in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.

## The Challenges of Bootstrapping

While offering immense benefits, bootstrapping a business is inherently challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>:

*   **Financial Constraints**: Without external funding, founders must be extremely resourceful and keep costs as low as possible, often performing most tasks themselves initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Scrappiness**: The abundance of capital in venture-backed models can lead to "sloppiness" and less discipline in managing costs and generating revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>. Bootstrapping forces the essential practice of making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Change**: Adopting independent principles in an existing, larger company can be difficult due to ingrained momentum and past practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>. Gradual, low-criticality experiments are recommended for adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty**: Projects, especially new ones, carry inherent uncertainty. Being at peace with the possibility of failure (negative visualization) is crucial for moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>.

## The "Once" Initiative: A New Chapter in Independence

Despite previously aiming to focus on a single product (Basecamp), 37signals pivoted to developing new products again, driven by a desire to continue creating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. This led to the "Once" initiative – a new line of non-SaaS products available for a single, one-time payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:32">[01:23:32]</a>.

The "Once" model aims to counter "subscription fatigue" and provide alternatives to expensive, recurring software fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>. Products under "Once" are:
*   **Self-Hosted**: Users download and install the software on their own servers or cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>.
*   **No Recurring Fees**: A single payment grants ownership, with updates for minor versions (e.g., 1.x) included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:55">[01:31:55]</a>.
*   **High Quality, Essential Functionality**: Designed as "generics" – simple, beautifully crafted tools that nail the 80/20 rule, focusing on core functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>.
*   **Open Code Access**: Users receive the code, allowing for modification and tweaking, which is a novel offering in business software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.

The first "Once" product is a relaunch of Campfire, an early group chat tool that predated Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>. This re-entry into a commoditized market aims to offer a high-quality, low-cost alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. It also explores opportunities for niche uses, such as air-gapped internal communication for high-security environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a>. The product aims to have very few words to be instantly available globally without localization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:44">[01:29:44]</a>.

This [[Inventiveness and innovation in business | inventive]] endeavor reflects 37signals' commitment to exploring new realms and providing different perspectives, reinforcing that [[Challenges in Business Strategy | avoiding complexity]] and maintaining independence are central to their long-term strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>.

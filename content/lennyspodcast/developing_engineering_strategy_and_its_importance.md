Will Larson, CTO at Carta and author of "The Engineering Executive's Primer," emphasizes the critical, yet often unaddressed, role of engineering strategy within companies. He notes that while other functions often articulate their strategies, engineering sometimes lags in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## The Importance of a Written Strategy

A common issue across companies, including engineering, is that strategy exists implicitly but is rarely written down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. This leads to ambiguity and inconsistent application across different layers of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

The fundamental rule of [[strategy_development_and_execution | strategy development and execution]] is that if you write it down, you can improve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. A written strategy allows for debugging and clarification, ensuring that everyone understands and correctly applies the company's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Defining Strategy: Rumelt's Framework

Larson advocates for Richard Rumelt's definition of strategy, outlined in "Good Strategy Bad Strategy" and "The Crux" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>:

1.  **Diagnosis**: Identifying the current status quo and the real problems facing the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Bad strategy often stems from a "willful disbelief" of an accurate diagnosis, leading to incoherent guiding policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
2.  **Guiding Policies**: Principles that dictate how to address the diagnosed problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
3.  **Actions**: Specific steps to implement the guiding policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Rumelt emphasizes actions to prevent "inert strategy" – strategies that sound good but are never implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

For engineering, strategy is particularly useful for clarifying how future decisions will be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Successful Engineering Strategy

### Embrace "Boring" Strategies
Often, effective strategies are "so boring it's hard to talk about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. These strategies typically involve [[elements_of_a_successful_strategy | constraints]] that focus an organization's energy on what truly matters to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

*   **Example: Standard Kit**: A common, effective, but seemingly "boring" strategy is to exclusively use existing tools and technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. While this might frustrate some engineers who desire new tools, it channels their efforts into building innovative features for users rather than developing new tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

### Key Attributes of Good Values/Strategies
When considering company or organizational values, which are closely related to strategy, Larson highlights three attributes:

1.  **Honesty**: Values must genuinely reflect what the company *actually does*, not just what it aspires to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Claims like "users first" are only meaningful if decisions consistently prioritize users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
2.  **Applicability**: Values should be directly usable in making decisions. For instance, "optimize globally" is a value that guides engineers to consider organizational-level benefits over mere team-level convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.
3.  **Reversibility**: A good value should have a clear opposite that a company *could* plausibly choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. Values like "we build good software" or "we solve customer problems that matter" are often "identity values" – statements that are universally desirable but offer no practical guidance for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. For example, Netflix's "we're a team, not a family" is reversible, as some companies explicitly state they are a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

## Examples of Engineering Strategies in Practice

*   **Uber's Data Centers**: During Larson's time at Uber (around 2014), the company maintained a strict "no cloud" policy, relying entirely on its own data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. While challenging, this allowed Uber to rapidly expand into regions like China within three months, bypassing geopolitical constraints faced by cloud-dependent companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Stripe's Ruby Monolith**: Stripe's strategy centered on maintaining a Ruby monolith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This policy, though disliked by some engineers, focused development efforts on building features for users rather than fragmenting resources on supporting multiple programming languages or toolchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

In both cases, these strategies dictated how limited capacities were invested into problems the company prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Improving Your Engineering Strategy

To get better at [[importance_of_strategy_and_decision_making_in_product_management | strategy and decision making]], Larson recommends:

*   "Good Strategy Bad Strategy" by Richard Rumelt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>
*   "Thinking in Systems" by Donella Meadows, which helps in modeling reality for better diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>
*   "Technology Strategy Patterns" by Evan Hitt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>
*   "The Value Flywheel Effect" by Anderson, McCon, and O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>
*   "The Phoenix Project" by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford, a modern reinterpretation of "The Goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>

He also discusses [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | developing and deploying a product strategy]] in his upcoming book, "The Engineering Executive's Primer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Aligning Engineering with Business Goals

A key aspect of [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | executing strategy effectively]] is ensuring that engineering is aligned with the broader business and product goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Larson emphasizes that engineering exists to support the product and customers, not merely to build novel systems for their own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

To improve the relationship between engineering managers and product managers, Larson suggests acknowledging that incentives are often misaligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. His approach at Carta, for example, is to tie the performance ratings of engineering and product managers together. This forces them to work collaboratively to solve for the entire set of constraints, rather than just their functional constraints, creating a shared understanding of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. This fosters shared incentives, leading to more powerful team dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

[[importance_of_company_mission_and_strategy_in_product_development | The importance of aligning incentives for engineering and product management teams]] is crucial for overall organizational efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Engineers should be treated as peers and given senior leadership roles, with accountability for solving real problems, rather than being "coddled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This shift empowers engineers to grow and contribute more significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

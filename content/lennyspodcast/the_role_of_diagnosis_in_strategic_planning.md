Richard Rumelt, an expert in strategy, defines a strategy as a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge, which is a mixture of policy and action meant to address a specific issue, whether positive or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This core concept of strategy originates from the Greek word *Stratos*, referring to elected leaders in Athens who dealt with the day's issues like invasions or plagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## The Kernel of Good Strategy

According to Rumelt, effective strategic thinking involves three essential components, often referred to as the "kernel" of strategy:
1.  **Diagnosis**: An understanding of the situation and the nature of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
2.  **Guiding Policy**: A general approach or decision on how to deal with the diagnosed challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
3.  **Coherent Actions**: A set of coordinated actions designed to implement the guiding policy and address the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

If any of these three elements are missing, it is not truly a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

## Importance of Diagnosis

Diagnosis is the critical first step in strategic planning, involving figuring out what is truly going on in a situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It requires deciding what to pay attention to and forming hypotheses about how things connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This step helps identify the "one or two key challenges that can actually be addressed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

For instance, when Microsoft faces the challenge of adapting to AI, their strategy begins with a diagnosis of how to adapt, leading to a guiding policy to invest in major AI leaders and incorporate AI into their search engine, followed by coherent actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

## Consequences of Lacking Diagnosis

A significant cause of [[challenges_and_misconceptions_in_strategic_thinking | bad strategy]] is a missing or superficial diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. Instead of a clear diagnosis, bad strategies often present:
*   **Abstract high-level goals**: Such as increasing growth and profit simultaneously, which can conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Goals are engineering aspects of a company, not a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   **Ambitions**: A list of things one wishes would happen, without identifying the root problems or how to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.
*   **Fluff**: Using fancy or abstract words to describe a situation without substance, creating "word salad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Self-contradictory actions**: Proposing actions that fight each other, demonstrating incoherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

Rumelt provides examples of this lacking diagnosis:
*   The US Department of Defense's strategy for 17 intelligence agencies was merely that they "should work together more effectively," without diagnosing *why* coordination was difficult or what barriers existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   A foundry company stating their diagnosis was "not grown fast enough" is not a diagnosis but a statement of value; it doesn't explain *why* they aren't growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   President Obama's observation that the US was falling behind in education (a correct statement) was not followed by a diagnosis of *why*, but rather an immediate jump to a goal of more people going to college, which doesn't directly address the issue of 15-year-olds' math skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
*   Public policy issues like homelessness often suffer from competing diagnoses (e.g., lack of housing vs. drug addiction), and without resolving the argument over the diagnosis, effective action is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

## Challenges in Diagnosis

The process of diagnosis is often hindered by:
*   **Organizational Politics**: People disagree on the importance of different issues, and their private interests can influence their perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. Information can come with hidden agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.
*   **Complexity of Reality**: Humans cannot understand all reality, so diagnosis involves selecting what to pay attention to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Hesitancy to Make Choices**: Leaders may be reluctant to make hard choices that could hurt certain interests or change power relationships within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.

## [[improving_strategic_thinking_through_practice_and_betterment | Developing Diagnostic Skill]]

To improve diagnostic abilities and foster insight, Rumelt suggests:
*   **Study History**: Immerse oneself in historical events, business biographies, and world history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>. This provides analogies and helps understand how complex situations unfolded, forming one's own opinions rather than just accepting theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
*   **Focus on "What Makes it Hard"**: Ask clients or teams what makes a situation difficult or what barriers prevent achieving ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.
*   **Seek Insight**: Insight is not magical but comes from deep immersion in the nature of the problem, allowing one to see a way through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>. Designers often experience this by focusing on the "crux" – the hardest part of a problem – and then seeing a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.

## Diagnosis in Practice: The Action Agenda

Instead of calling it a "strategy," Rumelt advises calling it an "action agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. This reframing emphasizes concrete actions to deal with a specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. The process starts with identifying ambitions, then asking what's holding you back or what barriers exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

The key is to choose a challenge that is both **important** (close to ambitions) and **achievable** (something that can be addressed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. The action agenda then consists of clear action steps to tackle this chosen challenge, rather than a list of goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>.

## Diagnosis in Startups

For founders and startups, the concept of diagnosis is still crucial. While dealing with significant uncertainty, founders are making a "bet" on a particular product-market solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | Startups]] often begin with an idea of customers who want a specific product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

Successful startups often "switch" their focus, realizing their initial diagnosis of the target customer or problem was incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>. This requires being convinced of eventual success while also being willing to shift and adapt when things aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. The action agenda for a startup must involve quick adaptation to changing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>.

Rumelt suggests that the job of a founder is to find an important and achievable problem, and then solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. This involves identifying "value denied" – what people should be able to buy but cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>. By imagining how something *ought* to be (e.g., a perfect window), one can uncover opportunities for new businesses, despite potential barriers like regulations or material limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:48">[01:27:48]</a>.

In conclusion, [[importance_of_strategy_and_decision_making_in_product_management | strategy]] is not mysterious; it's about solving problems by diagnosing the most important challenge one faces and taking consistent, focused, and achievable actions to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a>. This methodical approach is key to [[becoming_more_strategic | becoming more strategic]] and effective in any endeavor.

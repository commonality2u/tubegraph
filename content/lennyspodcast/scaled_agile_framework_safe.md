The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is a concept that emerged from the desire to [[agile_methodologies_and_their_evolution | scale Scrum]] and other agile processes within organizations [00:00:01]. It provides a structured approach to [[agile_methodologies_and_their_evolution | Agile]] for large enterprises [00:26:41].

## Origin and Purpose
SAFe was developed by Dean Leffingwell, originating from a more structured approach to [[agile_methodologies_and_their_evolution | Agile]] called Rational Unified Processing [00:26:43]. It was designed to connect multiple agile teams at scale within an organization and introduce rigor and process to their operations [00:27:28]. While not the only scaling framework (others include LeSS and Scrum at Scale) [00:27:00], SAFe became the most widely marketed, promising a comprehensive model for software development [00:27:11]. Executives at very large enterprises, often with tens of thousands of employees, adopted SAFe because it prescribed a detailed operating model for development [00:27:36].

Many [[adoption_and_challenges_of_agile_and_scrum_in_large_organizations | large companies]] that traditionally did not grow up building software turn to frameworks like SAFe, seeking rigor at scale [00:44:03]. These companies, including pharmaceutical firms, banks, and insurance companies, often outsourced development or had IT teams but didn't prioritize digital until recently [00:40:00]. SAFe provides a guideline for them, acting as a "handbook" for leaders new to technology organization management [00:40:20].

## Structure and Components
SAFe is represented by a large, complex map that describes various elements [00:27:55]. Key roles and processes within SAFe include:
*   **Product Owner**: Positioned as part of the [[agile_methodologies_and_their_evolution | agile]] team, working alongside [[agile_methodologies_and_their_evolution | Scrum Masters]] (team coaches) and developers [00:30:25]. In SAFe, the Product Owner's role is often focused on maintaining a full backlog for developers and writing user stories [00:28:54]. They are sometimes seen as "order takers," highly tactical, and separate from strategic product managers [00:34:37].
*   **Product Manager**: In SAFe, the Product Manager sits with a system architect and a Release Train Engineer [00:30:34]. Their role typically involves discovery work and feeding information to Product Owners [00:32:27].
*   **Release Train Engineer (RTE)**: Responsible for pulling multiple [[agile_methodologies_and_their_evolution | agile]] teams into a "release train" to ensure smooth shipment of products or features [00:30:40].
*   **Big Room Planning**: A quarterly event where the entire Release Train gathers to break down and commit to work for the upcoming quarter [00:31:06]. This commitment often occurs without prior deep discovery [00:31:24].

SAFe attempts to incorporate elements like OKRs and roadmaps into its map [00:34:06], but critics argue it struggles to integrate the full product lifecycle, particularly balancing discovery and delivery [00:34:18].

## Criticisms and Challenges
Melissa Perry strongly advises against using SAFe [00:00:08]. Her key criticisms include:
*   **Overkill and Rigidity**: SAFe is considered "Overkill" and excessively prescriptive, often hindering rather than helping [00:37:12]. People who find success with SAFe typically end up modifying or "ripping it up" into something else that is no longer SAFe "by the book" [00:49:31].
*   **Process over Value**: Organizations can become so focused on SAFe processes (e.g., meetings, sprint adherence, release planning) that they lose sight of delivering customer value or achieving business goals [00:50:52]. This can lead to delays in critical functions, as exemplified by a water company that went bankrupt due to slow deployments caused by excessive process adherence [00:50:21].
*   **Misconception of Roles**: SAFe often creates a split between Product Managers and Product Owners, leading to Product Owners becoming mere "order takers" focused solely on backlog management and tactical tasks [00:34:37]. This limits their ability to engage in strategic work, customer research, and market analysis, hindering their career growth into product management [00:35:01].
*   **Lack of Discovery**: SAFe processes like Big Room Planning can lead to teams committing to work for a quarter without adequate discovery, market research, or customer input [00:31:24]. Product Owners and developers report feeling pressured to fill backlogs even if the work isn't prioritized or necessary [00:30:05].
*   **Dependency on External Consultants**: SAFe thrives on selling certifications and consulting services [01:07:22]. Many organizations are introduced to SAFe by large consulting firms, who may not have long-term experience in transforming and maintaining internal operations [01:18:46].

## Adoption Trends and Outcomes
Despite criticisms, SAFe continues to be adopted by many organizations, especially [[adoption_and_challenges_of_agile_and_scrum_in_large_organizations | large companies]] that are not software-native [00:39:34]. Executives are drawn to its detailed, "plug-and-play" roadmap for [[agile_methodologies_and_their_evolution | Agile]] transformation [00:36:40]. However, many companies that adopted SAFe have since abandoned it, such as Capital One [00:36:00]. It is not uncommon for parts of a large organization to use SAFe while other parts do not [00:36:20].

## Impact on Roles and Career Paths
The product owner role did not emerge from modern product management; it was initially a way to help developers prioritize work [00:00:23]. In [[agile_methodologies_and_their_evolution | Scrum]], the product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of work done by the team, but the early Scrum Guide even suggested that a product owner could be an internal "customer" or a developer, not necessarily a product manager [01:15:54].

A significant challenge posed by SAFe and similar rigid [[agile_methodologies_and_their_evolution | agile]] implementations is the creation of product owner roles without clear [[career_growth_framework_for_product_managers | career paths]] [00:45:50]. This can lead to high churn in these roles, as individuals seek opportunities for strategic growth [01:00:38].

In contrast, major tech companies (e.g., Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix) do not typically employ "product owners"; they have "product managers" who handle the full spectrum of product responsibilities from market research to working with developers and iterating [01:11:06].

## Recommendations for Organizations and Individuals
For organizations undergoing digital transformations, Melissa Perry advises focusing on a holistic product operating model rather than just a development operating model [01:41:01]. This includes:
*   **Product Strategy**: Developing a clear product strategy [01:42:05].
*   **Organizational Design**: Structuring teams around products with skilled product managers at all levels [01:42:08].
*   **Product Operations**: Building infrastructure to support teams with data access and customer interaction capabilities [01:42:21].
*   **Culture and Incentives**: Shifting from rewarding output (shipping many features) to rewarding outcomes (delivering measurable value aligned with business goals) [01:42:58].
*   **Transparency and Processes**: Implementing processes and tools for transparency, especially in large organizations, to connect team work back to business objectives [01:44:06].
*   **Skilled Leadership**: Bringing in experienced product leaders who can guide the transformation and mentor less experienced staff [00:52:38]. Leaders should understand that product management is a business role that rolls up to furthering the business, not just a team role [00:46:03].
*   **Career Paths**: Ensuring clear career paths for product professionals, allowing them to grow from individual contributors to managing product lines [00:45:50].

For individuals in a product owner role who want to grow into product management:
*   **Take Ownership**: Proactively seek opportunities to be more strategic and push back on purely tactical tasks [00:58:01].
*   **Seek Customer Interaction**: Ask to participate in customer research or directly engage with users [00:59:04].
*   **Focus on Value and Outcomes**: When discussing work, emphasize the problem being solved, the value delivered, and the metrics impacted, rather than just process adherence [00:59:19]. Ask "What do we hope will happen when we release this?" [00:59:32].
*   **Question Career Paths**: Ask leaders about your career trajectory to prompt organizational reflection [00:58:47].
*   **Rethink Certifications**: Be cautious of [[career_growth_framework_for_product_managers | agile]] certifications (like CSPO) if aiming for roles in tech companies, as they often prioritize experience and demonstrable outcomes over certifications [01:08:37].
*   **Update Resume**: Describe your job functions from a value perspective, highlighting problems solved, user understanding, and measurable business impact, not just process steps [01:05:03].
*   **Internal Mobility**: Consider moving to different divisions or teams within a large corporation that demonstrate more effective product practices [01:01:52].
*   **External Opportunities**: If unable to practice good product management, consider seeking opportunities in organizations that do it well [01:01:33].

Ultimately, true [[agile_methodologies_and_their_evolution | agile]] involves moving quickly and delivering great value to customers [01:17:32]. This requires a flexible approach, inspecting and adapting processes rather than rigidly following a prescribed framework [01:17:47]. There is no quick fix or "fast track" to building great products; it requires continuous learning and adaptation [01:31:32].

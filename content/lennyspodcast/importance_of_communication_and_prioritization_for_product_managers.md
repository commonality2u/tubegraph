Ian McAllister, a seasoned product leader with extensive experience at Amazon, Airbnb, and Uber, identifies effective communication and prioritization as two of the most critical skills for product managers at all career stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. His insights, drawn from managing over 100 product managers and authoring influential posts, highlight these as foundational elements for success and career growth in product management.

## Core Attributes of a Top Product Manager

McAllister's framework for what separates a top 1% PM from others includes a comprehensive list of attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. While no single PM excels at all of them, a focus on key areas can lead to significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>. For new product managers, the top three skills to master are communication, prioritization, and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.

## Communication: The Test of Thinking

Communication is a fundamental skill for product managers, serving as a direct reflection of their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:49">[01:48:49]</a>. It's a skill that requires continuous effort throughout a product career, with the stakes getting higher at senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>.

### Common Communication Pitfalls

*   **Rambling or providing unnecessary background** before getting to the point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.
*   **Not directly answering questions**, especially "when" questions with a clear date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:54">[01:53:54]</a>.

### Tips for Improving Communication

*   **Answer First, Then Explain**: When asked a question, provide the answer directly, then follow with explanations if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>. Sometimes, simply answering and then stopping is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:03">[01:32:03]</a>.
*   **Use Numbers**: Employ data and numbers to answer questions effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:54">[01:55:54]</a>.
*   **Learn from Feedback**: Continuously [[the_importance_of_following_up_on_results_in_product_management | grade yourself]] after meetings, documents, or conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:54">[02:00:54]</a>. Reflect on how you could have communicated better and apply those learnings to future interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:56">[02:02:56]</a>. Asking your manager for specific feedback on communication is also beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:05">[02:03:05]</a>.
*   **Writing Effective Copy**: Beyond formal communication, the ability to write concise and effective copy for customers goes a long way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:55">[01:52:55]</a>.

## Prioritization: The Core Skill

Prioritization is considered the "number one key tool" of a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:49">[01:28:49]</a>. It encompasses many dimensions beyond just deciding which project to do next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>.

### Dimensions of Prioritization

*   **Thematic Focus**: Deciding which broad themes to prioritize in a roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>.
*   **Project Selection**: Choosing specific projects within a theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.
*   **Sequencing**: Determining the order in which projects will be tackled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[01:49:51]</a>.
*   **Scope Definition**: Deciding how much of a project to build for maximum [[balancing_output_and_impact_in_product_management_roles | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:55">[01:52:55]</a>.
*   **Time Management**: Prioritizing how a PM allocates their own time and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>.

### Impact of Strong Prioritization

A product manager with a strong innate ability to prioritize can generate five times the [[balancing_output_and_impact_in_product_management_roles | impact]] compared to someone without that skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. This skill was a key factor in McAllister's early success at Amazon, driving significant business growth by identifying high-leverage projects and marshaling team resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>. It can even compensate for deficiencies in other areas, such as raw intelligence or technical skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.

### Prioritization and the "Working Backwards" Approach

The "working backwards" philosophy, central to Amazon's product development, guides [[decision_making_in_product_management | prioritization]] by starting with the customer's problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>. Teams often err by starting with a solution in mind and then retrofitting a problem, rather than genuinely obsessing over the customer's pain point first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:11">[01:49:11]</a>. The internal press release and FAQ document are mechanisms used at Amazon to enforce this problem-first approach, ensuring a legitimate plan to succeed before significant resources are committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:08">[01:51:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:25">[01:56:25]</a>.

## Execution and Impact

While communication and prioritization are foundational, they ultimately serve the goal of [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | execution]] and driving impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. Product managers are seen as the "motive power" behind execution and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>. A key aspect of [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | execution]] is molding what needs to be built into a simple, compact package with the highest possible impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:31">[01:37:31]</a>. This requires strong collaboration with designers, data scientists, and especially engineers, helping them improve and ensuring they are well-resourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>.

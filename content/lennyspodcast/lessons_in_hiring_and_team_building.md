Michael Tru, CEO and co-founder of Cursor, shared insights on the company's approach to hiring and [[effective_team_building_and_leadership_in_startups | team building]], emphasizing the importance of strategic recruitment and a specific cultural disposition for success in a rapidly evolving AI landscape.

## Initial Hiring Philosophy and Evolution
When starting Cursor, the team was initially "paranoid about spinning for a while without releasing to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. They focused on building and dogfooding the product intensely, never shipping anything that wasn't useful to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. This hands-on approach instilled a realism about the current state of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

Counterintuitively, while many advise against hiring too fast, Cursor believes they "actually hired too slow to begin with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>. This was due to a strong emphasis on patience in hiring to ensure a world-class team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>.

## Ideal Candidate Profile
A critical aspect of Cursor's [[innovative_hiring_practices_in_startups | hiring strategy]] is assembling a team with specific traits:
*   **Intellectual Curiosity and Experimentation:** Essential for building new things in a rapidly changing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Honesty and Micro-Pessimism/Bluntness:** Crucial for maintaining a level head amidst external noise and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.
*   **Focus on Building and Quality:** Prioritizing "building something really great" and "doing really high quality work" over external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.
*   **Level-Headedness:** People whose "highs aren't very high and the lows aren't very low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

Initially, Cursor may have biased too much towards candidates fitting the "archetype of well-known school, very young, had done the things that were like high credential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>. However, they found success with "later careered" individuals who were also fantastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

## Interview Process
Cursor has evolved its [[effective_interviewing_and_candidate_selection | interview process]] significantly:
*   **Hand-Rolled Questions:** They utilize a custom set of interview questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.
*   **Two-Day Work Test:** A core component of their interview process involves candidates being on-site for two days to complete a work test project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>.
    *   This test is "not work that we use" but rather a "canal list of projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.
    *   It allows them to observe a candidate's "real work product" over two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.
    *   The work test helps determine if the team wants to be "around this person" by facilitating meals and extended interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.
    *   It also serves to excite candidates about the opportunity, particularly in the early stages when the product might not be well-known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.
    *   This method, initially thought not to scale beyond a few people, has shown "surprising staying power" even as the company grew to around 60 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.

## Team Structure and Focus
Cursor maintains a lean structure, with a high percentage of its approximately 60 employees in engineering, research, and design roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>. This contrasts with many software companies of similar size that might have over 100 people due to extensive operational or sales-led functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>. The company aims to grow larger in the future to continue improving its product and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.

> "The overall thing would note is, you know, maybe you know some of these things sound simple to specify but then like doing them well is is hard and there are rough ways you can run." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>

## Staying Focused in a Dynamic Environment
In a fast-moving AI industry, [[mentorship_and_team_leadership | leadership]] at Cursor maintains focus by:
*   **Strategic Hiring:** Recruiting individuals with the right disposition, who are less focused on external validation and more on building great products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.
*   **Leading by Example:** Management strives to model the desired focus and level-headedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.
*   **Building an "Immune System":** Over time, the team has developed the ability to discern which new technologies or ideas genuinely matter for the business, rather than being swayed by constant chatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>. This mirrors the evolution of deep learning, where a few simple, elegant ideas have staying power amidst a vast number of research papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

Michael Tru believes that [[building_and_scaling_a_companys_culture | hiring people]] with the right behaviors can significantly reduce the need for excessive process and hierarchy within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>.

## Future of Engineers and Software Demand
Despite advancements in AI and automation, Michael Tru foresees continued and even increased demand for engineers. This is because:
*   **Human Control:** Cursor aims for humans to remain in the "driver's seat," controlling software development, even in an end-state where programming is at a much higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
*   **Unmet Demand:** The current cost and labor intensiveness of building software mean there's immense unmet demand for new tools and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>. By reducing friction and costs, AI will enable the creation of "tons and tons and tons of more stuff that we could do our computers, tons more tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>.

> "I think long into the future, yes, there will actually be more demand for engineers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>

The company emphasizes the importance of continually improving its product and services, believing that the market for new tools is "much bigger than people have realized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>. This requires setting up the team to be able to "make new stuff in addition to... continuing to improve the stuff that you have right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. Michael often studies the history of past [[lessons_from_successful_founders_and_startups | computer companies]] to inform his approach to [[building_effective_product_teams | building a successful company]] in this new era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

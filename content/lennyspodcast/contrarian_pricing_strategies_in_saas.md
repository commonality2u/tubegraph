Rahul Vora, founder and CEO of Superhuman, discusses his company's unique and often contrarian approach to pricing strategy, particularly for a product like email, which is traditionally free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>. Superhuman charges $30 per month, a strategy that has gained traction and influenced other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>.

## The Importance of Positioning
Before determining [[different_pricing_models_and_strategies_for_products | pricing]], Vora emphasizes the critical need to establish clear positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. Superhuman positions itself as the "best email tool on the market," built for high-performing teams and individuals, serving the high end of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.

## The Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter
Superhuman utilized the Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter to set its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. In its early years, the company surveyed approximately 100 of its earliest users with four key questions:
1.  **Too Expensive:** At what price would you consider Superhuman to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>
2.  **Too Low:** At what price would you consider Superhuman to be priced so low that you'd be worried about its quality and you wouldn't buy it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>
3.  **Getting Expensive:** What price would you consider Superhuman to be starting to get expensive so that it's not out of the question, but you'd have to give some thought to buying it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>
4.  **Bargain:** At what price would you consider Superhuman to be a bargain? A great buy for the money? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>

Most startups tend to orient their pricing around the fourth price point (the "bargain"), especially in greenfield opportunities or marketplaces, aiming for maximum sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>. However, Superhuman targeted the third price point: where it "starts to feel expensive" but still justifies the purchase after considering the time saved and return on investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. The median answer for this third question was $30 per month, which became Superhuman's chosen price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.

## Validating the Price Point
After selecting the price, Superhuman performed a "gut check" to ensure it supported their venture scale ambitions. Assuming a valuation of 10 times annual recurring revenue (ARR), they calculated that to achieve a billion-dollar valuation, they would need $100 million in ARR. At $30 per month, this would require 300,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. The team confidently believed they could reach hundreds of thousands of subscribers, leading them to proceed with the $30 price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>.

## Proving the Value
Superhuman actively tracks metrics to demonstrate the value of its product, especially important when charging for a traditionally free service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>. By comparing user behavior 30 days or a year before and after using Superhuman, they show that users:
*   Get through email twice as fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>.
*   Respond one to two days faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>.
*   Save four hours or more every week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:32">[01:06:32]</a>.

A major consulting firm independently corroborated these findings, observing that their partners saved 3.3 hours per person per week with Superhuman, a level of efficiency only matched by tools like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:52">[01:23:52]</a>. These quantifiable benefits reinforce the product's value and justify its premium price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

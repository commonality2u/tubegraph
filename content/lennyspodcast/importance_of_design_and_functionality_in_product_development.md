The conversation around product development often pits functionality against beauty, with the perception that "functionality is King" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> and beauty is a separate, less important aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. However, this view is challenged by emphasizing that functionality and beauty are not opposite, but rather complementary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Enhancing Functionality Through Beauty and Design

Beauty in design actively enhances functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Beautiful products are "easier to use, more approachable, uh more compelling to use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Beyond usability, the aesthetic quality of a product also influences user sentiment. For instance, people tweeting from Penn Station, a less aesthetically pleasing environment, tended to be more negative than those from Grand Central Station, which is considered more beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. This demonstrates how created environments impact how people feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

Furthermore, products that exhibit painstaking [[importance_of_attention_to_detail_in_product_design | attention to detail]] and beauty tend to increase trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. When users perceive that a company cares deeply about the visible details of how something works, it creates an assurance that they also care about "other details that you can't see" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This is particularly crucial for companies in sensitive areas like financial infrastructure, where beauty is a key priority because it increases trust, makes products easier to use, and leads to better user outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

## The Business Value of Design and Quality

Despite the intellectual understanding of [[the_importance_of_design_and_user_experience_in_building_software | the value of design]] and high quality in product development, day-to-day prioritization often favors new features over design refinement, partly due to the unclear ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. However, design and quality are inextricably linked to business growth.

### Levels of Quality
Quality in product development exists on a spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>:
1.  **Baseline Quality:** The product works and provides value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
2.  **Error-Free/Well-Rounded:** The product functions reliably without errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
3.  **Exceeding Expectations:** The product goes beyond what the user seeks, offering unexpected delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

The challenge lies in prioritizing reaching those higher levels of quality against the "seduction by the chase of another feature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, especially when customers vocally demand new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. However, companies that consider quality non-negotiable understand that it is "absolutely functionality" and crucial for usability and desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

Quality directly drives growth. Products that are "easier to use and more understandable" will compel people to use them more, leading to better experiences and word-of-mouth promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Real-World Impact
At Stripe, the growth team is "maniacally focused on building better experiences because we've seen it tie directly to our business metrics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. For instance, improvements in onboarding flows, making products easier to understand, have led to increased activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

A significant example of business impact through design quality is in the checkout experience:
*   Research on top e-commerce sites revealed that 99% had errors in their checkout flow that hindered seamless, quicker transactions and higher conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   By improving the quality of the checkout experience through small and large details, Stripe observed a "10.5% increase in business's revenue" when comparing an older form of checkout to a newer one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. These "little details matter to have such a material impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   Stripe powers checkout flows for millions of businesses globally, including large organizations like Amazon, Hertz, Shopify, and Spotify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### Design as a Holistic Goal
The distinction between "business goals" and "design goals" is often a pet peeve because ultimately, impactful products are quality products that serve customers positively, building a stronger business long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. While designers may focus more on the emotional experience and how users feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, and others might focus on "make the button bigger and they'll click it more often" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>, [[importance_of_integrating_ux_research_in_product_development | multi-disciplinary teams]] are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. When teams align on building "something great," they recognize that utility, usability, and desirability combined make a truly great product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Beauty makes things more useful and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

## Operationalizing Quality and Design

Achieving consistent quality requires a concerted, ongoing effort, as there is a "gravitational pull... to mediocrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.

### Key Principles for Quality
Insights from various design, product, and engineering leaders reveal several themes for building quality:
1.  **Group Effort:** Quality is a shared responsibility across the organization, not just one team or individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Internal standards and communication directly reflect external product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.
2.  **Vision and Alignment:** Without a clear vision, even talented individuals may create disjointed parts rather than a cohesive whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.
3.  **Editing/Curation:** A designated "editor" (like an architect in house building) is needed to ensure all pieces fit together and remove what doesn't align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
4.  **Courage:** Leaders must have the resolve to say "no, this isn't good enough" and push for improvement, even when teams have put in significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
5.  **User Perspective:** Understanding quality requires seeing the product from the user's perspective, especially across their entire journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

### The "Walk the Store" Process
To combat quality regression over time, Stripe implemented a "Walk the Store" process:
*   **Identify Critical User Journeys:** They selected 15 essential user journeys that deeply matter to their users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Leadership:** Each journey has responsible engineering, product, and design leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
*   **Regular Review:** Leaders regularly "walk the store" by putting themselves in the user's shoes, experiencing the product from an internet search to specific in-product actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. This supplements [[importance_of_integrating_ux_research_in_product_development | user research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.
*   **Friction Logging & Scoring:** They log friction points, file bugs, and score the journey based on a rubric covering usability, utility, and desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>. Scoring uses a color system (e.g., yellow, green) rather than numbers to avoid getting "tied around the axle on how you're measuring it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a> and encourage qualitative judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Calibration:** Teams come together quarterly in a "Product Quality Review" (PQR) to discuss scores and calibrate their quality bar across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. This process increases awareness and accountability, leading to an upstream impact on product improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

### Visual Communication and Interdisciplinary Collaboration
To foster clarity and awareness across growing companies, a simple method involves designers sharing screenshots or prototypes of their work in a shared Google Slide deck every few weeks (currently monthly at Stripe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. This allows designers to see related work and patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. This deck is also shared with product managers, engineering leaders, and company leaders to help them understand what's being built and how it fits into the broader user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. The low-maintenance nature of a slide deck ensures broad accessibility across functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>. This transparency helps identify redundant efforts or misaligned paths early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

Another key operational change is to break down physical and organizational silos. At Lyft, designers were initially isolated in a beautifully designed room, separated by a locked door from engineering and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. While this fostered creative space, it led to wasted work and misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>. Reorganizing teams to sit together (designers, engineers, and product managers working on the same feature) and aligning their goals led to "much like faster kind of iteration Cycles [and] better Clarity on how the work was working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>. Retaining dedicated creative spaces for critique and working sessions allowed for the "best of both worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Vision and Bold Ideas
Companies often exhibit a "fear of bold ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>, preferring incremental approaches that are easier to measure and manage within short timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>. However, this can prevent overall product improvement, as user experiences span across multiple products, surfaces, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.

Instead, it's vital to "reach for the stars and land on the Moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a> through [[innovations_in_product_design_and_user_experience | vision work]]. This involves sketching out the "ideal version" of the entire user experience, akin to an architect's plan for a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. Without a North Star, it's difficult to increment towards the right outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>. While the entire vision doesn't need to ship at once, having a clear end goal guides measured and thoughtful progress, allowing for learning and iteration along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

## Hiring for Design and Quality

When hiring for roles related to design and quality, particularly for non-designers or founders, key traits to look for are:
1.  **Taste and Judgment:** "It's easier to teach tools and process than it is taste and character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. Assess a candidate's "hit rate for you know great judgment and and great taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.
2.  **Humility:** Humility is crucial for team collaboration and an openness to learning from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>. Humble individuals are more likely to "pay more attention to what the users are saying" and strive for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.
3.  **Hustle/Hutzpah (Courage):** The act of creation is scary, requiring courage to propose new solutions or declare something "not good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. A candidate with this drive will "fight for great" and execute rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>.

For early-stage companies, while a "doer" is often needed, it's also important to bring in someone with a strategic "lens of you know how do you build an organization that's user focused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>. This might mean having a senior design advisor alongside a full-time executor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.

## Design as Intention

At its core, design is about intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a> – bringing intentionality to decisions and considering "who is impacted by this who is using this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18">[01:20:18]</a>. This applies to anything from designing a doorknob to structuring an organization or defining a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>. While design expertise brings "creative skills and and these Great Taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>, anyone can contribute by bringing "more care and intentionality" to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>, leading to better outcomes internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. This aligns with the broader [[importance_of_philosophy_and_values_in_product_development | philosophy and values in product development]] that prioritizes craft and user focus.

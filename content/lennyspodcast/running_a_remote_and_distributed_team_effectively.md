Linear operates as a fully remote and distributed company, with employees across different time zones, including Europe and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:17">[01:25:17]</a>. This setup presents challenges for group gatherings due to time differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>.

## Cultivating Culture in a Distributed Environment

To foster connection and culture in a remote setting, Linear engages in unique activities like quarterly baking and cooking competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>.

> [!INFO] Remote Team Building: The Linear Baking/Cooking Competition
> Inspired by "The Great British Baking Show," Linear hosts regular virtual cooking events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:46">[01:25:46]</a>.
>
> Participants:
> *   Receive a chosen recipe (baking or cooking) that is reasonable to complete in a few hours without extensive equipment or skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>.
> *   Buy ingredients using a company card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>.
> *   Join a Zoom call to cook or bake together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:20">[01:26:20]</a>.
> *   Engage in chat, help each other with cooking issues (e.g., "my dough looks weird") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>.
> *   Share pictures of their creations on a Slack channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>.
> *   Participate in friendly visual competitions, given that taste and texture cannot be assessed remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a>. This activity also aligns with Linear's focus on [[Building and managing a successful tech team | craft and quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:25">[01:27:25]</a>.

## Strategic Hiring for High-Performing Remote Teams

Linear believes in building better products with fewer, high-quality people rather than larger, average teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. This belief guides their very deliberate [[Optimizing hiring and team management for tech startups | hiring process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

Key hiring principles:
*   **Slow Growth** Linear has never more than doubled its employee count in a year, maintaining a guideline of not exceeding this growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on "Taste" and Broader Perspective** Candidates are assessed for their "taste" and "understanding of how things are done," looking for individuals with a broader perspective beyond their specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.
*   **Product Sensibility and Judgment** For engineers, this includes evaluating their product thinking and ability to articulate why certain choices are better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. For marketing or operations hires, it means looking for appreciation of storytelling or understanding of related fields like HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.
*   **Ownership Beyond Title** The goal is to hire individuals who are "more than their title" and willing to take on broader scope, fostering a culture where people rarely say "it's not my job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. This allows for a company with fewer specialized roles and more effective units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>.

### Paid Work Trials

Linear employs a paid work trial as the final step in its hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.
*   **Structure:** Candidates act as mini-contractors, given a vague problem statement (e.g., "build this feature") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. They must understand the problem, scope it, and build a version within a specific timeframe, gaining access to the codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.
*   **Benefits for Candidate:** Provides insight into the company's operations, code quality, and the nature of work and ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>. Candidates can join meetings, access internal tools (Slack, Notion), and interact with team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>.
*   **Benefits for Company:** Allows assessment of how candidates operate in the actual environment, their problem-solving approach, and ability to make quick progress, which is crucial for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.
*   **Feasibility:** Linear accommodates candidates by scheduling trials on weekends or holidays, noting that few candidates decline due to the perceived value of the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

### Testing for Product Sensibility

During interviews, particularly for roles like engineering, questions delve into candidates' past projects, focusing on *why* decisions were made, whether they agreed with them, and what they would have done differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>. The goal is to assess if candidates possess independent thoughts and can articulate their reasoning with rationale, beyond simply stating "I didn't like it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

## Maintaining Focus and Operational Efficiency

A core philosophy at Linear, relevant for [[Small team management and operational efficiency in startups | managing a small, effective team]], is maintaining extreme focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

> [!INFO] Main Quest vs. Side Quests
> Drawing an analogy from RPG games, Linear categorizes activities as "main quest lines" (building the product and making it awesome for customers) and "side quest lines" (distractions like making t-shirts or non-essential certifications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. The advice is to "avoid the side quests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. This helps prioritize and delay non-essential tasks until the opportune moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

Another guiding principle is "go slow to go fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>. This means taking time to think and plan thoroughly before rushing into execution, which ultimately leads to faster and more efficient outcomes by avoiding rework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:25">[01:36:25]</a>.

## Leadership in a Remote Context

As a CEO, the role involves a wide range of tasks beyond a single domain, such as compensation, marketing plans, and offsite events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>. To manage this, the CEO focuses on [[evolving_team_structures_and_management_skills | hiring and delegation]], finding other leaders to take on specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:54">[01:29:54]</a>. This broad exposure allows for learning about diverse fields like financials and legal matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:13">[01:30:13]</a>.

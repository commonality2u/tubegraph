When operating a marketplace, a common question arises regarding whether to focus efforts on increasing supply or demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. It is acknowledged that both sides are crucial and cannot be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. However, there's a tendency for people to over-rotate on supply and under-focus on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.

## Reasons for Supply Over-Focus
Several factors contribute to the disproportionate focus on supply:
*   **Early Importance** Supply is "disproportionately important early on because it is the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. Without sufficient supply, a marketplace has nothing to offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.
*   **Deeper Product Engagement** The supply side of a marketplace often uses the product more deeply, requiring more product resources due to a larger product surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.

This initial importance can mislead operators into believing that supply is the primary [[Experimentation and decisionmaking in marketplaces | optimization function]] for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

## The Primacy of Demand
Ultimately, demand is the sole determinant of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. Aggregating demand in an industry leads to a winning marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. Suppliers are always willing to join if a marketplace can provide customers who are ready to transact profitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. Therefore, "demand is the currency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

When making trade-offs or optimizing a business, the perspective of the customer or demand side is always the correct one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Supply and Demand
The optimal strategy is to acquire supply only to the extent that its impact on demand is understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. For example, adding more supply to a ride-sharing service might improve customer experience by reducing wait times only up to a certain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Beyond this threshold, additional supply may not significantly improve the customer experience and thus might not be worth the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. The focus should be on how supply acquisition improves the customer's experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

### Marketplace Balance and ROI Models
While monitoring marketplace balance metrics (e.g., buyer-to-seller ratio) is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>, a more effective approach is to develop dual-sided Return on Investment (ROI) equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>. These equations should fully internalize the marketplace dynamic, accounting for the cost of acquiring both demand and the necessary supply for that demand to transact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>. For instance, when acquiring a new rider for a ride-sharing service, the CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) should include not only the rider's CAC but also the CAC of acquiring the drivers needed for that rider's purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. Similarly, for the supply side, the business cannot make a sale unless customers are acquired to transact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.

By using these dual-sided ROI equations, businesses can effectively measure payback period and push acquisition to their comfortable threshold on either side, potentially allowing them to "somewhat ignore Marketplace balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>. An exception to this is when there are externalities not captured in the equation, such as suppliers becoming disillusioned and leaving the platform due to too little demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. Generally, building strong ROI models that account for these dynamics is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

### Example ROI Formula
A basic formulation for a dual-sided ROI equation is:
CAC for the focused side + (additional CAC for the other side of the marketplace * ratio of sides needed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. This total CAC is then compared to the customer's LTV (Lifetime Value) to calculate the payback period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. This framework provides a robust way to analyze the efficiency of growth investments across both sides of the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## The Criticality of Firing
Making hard decisions, especially concerning personnel, is crucial for a startup's survival and success. Many startups fail because the team isn't right, often due to a reluctance to address underperformance promptly [00:54:43].

When founders are asked when they realized their team wasn't right, most respond, "within the first month" [00:55:12]. If issues are known early but not acted upon, the problem isn't the team itself, but the CEO's inability to make difficult decisions [00:55:27]. In a small organization, everyone knows when someone shouldn't be there, whether due to underperformance or other issues [00:56:16]. This inaction leads to top-performing individuals leaving, as they don't want to work in an environment where hard decisions aren't made [00:55:50]. Building a startup is already challenging with the right team; with the wrong people, it becomes "Mission Impossible" [00:56:40].

## A Tactical Approach to Firing
A key piece of advice for [[hiring_and_team_management_philosophy_in_tech_startups | team management]] is to proactively evaluate new hires:
*   **Mark Your Calendar** Every time a new person is hired, mark your calendar for 30 days in the future [01:00:00].
*   **Ask the Question** On that day, ask yourself: "Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person?" [01:00:02].
*   **Act Decisively**
    *   **Yes:** If the answer is yes, express excitement for their performance, tell them they are exceeding expectations, and consider giving them more equity to secure their loyalty [01:00:26].
    *   **No:** If the answer is no, fire them immediately [01:00:41]. They are already on a trajectory of not being successful and are creating damage to themselves, the team, and the company [00:57:46]. This approach helps them find a place where they can be successful elsewhere [00:58:01].
*   **Seek Confirmation** If confirmation is needed for a difficult decision, ask top-performing team members how they would feel if the person in question were to leave [00:58:18]. Their reaction often provides clear insight [00:58:33].

This proactive approach is similar to Netflix's "keeper test," where managers constantly ask if they would fight to keep an employee if they were to leave [00:58:45].

## Hiring Considerations
When [[hiring_and_team_management_philosophy_in_tech_startups | hiring]], especially for early-stage companies, the CEO's role in conveying vision is paramount:
*   **Reference Checks** When checking references, ask a simple, direct question: "Would you hire them (again)?" [01:03:11]. The goal is to get a clear yes or no answer [01:03:21].
*   **CEO Presence in Investor Meetings** For early-stage fundraising, the CEO should attend meetings alone. Investors often base their decision on whether they "like the CEO" and "like the story" [00:43:18]. A solo CEO can command the "headlight" and prevent distractions, ensuring the investor's focus remains on them and their narrative [00:43:35].

## General Principles
The underlying philosophy for these [[challenges_of_managing_a_startup | challenging startup]] decisions is to constantly evaluate and adapt. This mindset applies to all aspects of life: "Knowing what you know today, would you do something different?" If the answer is yes, "do something different today" [01:00:15]. This approach emphasizes that today is "the first day of the rest of your life" [01:00:20].

Startups must be prepared to shift their focus and [[startup_scaling_strategies | priorities]] as they evolve. Initially, the focus is on achieving product-market fit. Once that is established, the entire company must "shift gears" to focus on [[hiring_for_growth_roles | growth]] or [[the_importance_of_pricing_strategy_for_startups_and_tech_companies | business model]] [00:33:02]. Failure to shift gears can lead to a company getting stuck in a previous phase [00:34:36]. This requires making "hard decisions" about what *not* to do, ensuring that the team's efforts are focused on the main goal for that specific phase [00:34:46].

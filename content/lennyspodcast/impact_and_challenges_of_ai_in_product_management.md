Aman Khan, Director of Product at Arise AI, discusses the transformative [[impact_of_ai_on_skills_and_products | impact of AI]] on product management, offering insights into [[transitioning_into_ai_product_management | transitioning into AI product management]] and how to excel in this evolving field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. His career has focused on building products in the AI space, including at Spotify, Cru, Zipline, and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## The Evolving Role of AI in Product Management

AI is making product managers significantly more productive, particularly with the rise of AI tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. It has become feasible for product managers to create prototypes and mocks much earlier in the process, even before engaging design teams, which elevates the starting point for discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

The product manager's role traditionally involves bringing together design, engineering, business development, operations, and sales to ship impactful products and represent the customer's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. With AI, this role is further enhanced.

### Types of AI Product Managers

Aman Khan identifies three main types of AI product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>:

1.  **AI Platform PMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>: These individuals build tools for AI Engineers. For example, a PM at Arise AI focuses on an observability and evaluation platform for artificial intelligence, helping AI engineers understand the impact of their models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. This space is still nascent, especially with large language models being relatively new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
2.  **AI Product PMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>: Here, the core product itself is centered around AI. Examples include platforms like ChatGPT or NotebookLM, where the core experience is enabled by the underlying AI model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. The PM's job is to package this advanced technology to be consumable for businesses, enterprises, or consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
3.  **AI-Powered PMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>: This type of PM is enabled by AI technology across the entire product management stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. They utilize models like large language models to build optimal customer experiences, even if they aren't responsible for building the core model from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>. AI is expected to become as common as databases for SaaS applications, meaning most PMs will likely trend towards this type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

## Practical Applications of AI for Product Managers

AI tools can significantly enhance a PM's efficiency and productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Some examples include:

*   **Prototyping and Development:**
    *   **Cursor** and **Replit** for building functional prototypes where buttons work and stories can be told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. Replit, for instance, can build and host a website from a prompt in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Vercel's v0** for generating landing pages and working UIs from prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
*   **Graphic Design:**
    *   **Midjourney** and **DALL-E** for creating logos, graphics, or visual user stories, depending on the PM's prompting ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
*   **3D Modeling:** Emerging tools are making it easier to build physical products through 3D modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Insights:** Tools like **Gong** can record and transcribe meetings, which can then be fed into large language models to identify common customer problems and pain points, scaling a PM's ability to gather insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.

The ability to use these tools to build actual products, even prototypes, helps PMs stand out to hiring managers by demonstrating their thinking and interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>. It's now easier to break into AI product management than before, as a deep machine learning background is less of a prerequisite compared to the ability to build experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges in AI product management | Challenges in AI Product Management]]

Despite the immense potential, there are notable [[challenges_in_ai_product_management | challenges in AI product management]]:

*   **Avoiding "Me Too" Products:** A significant challenge is the inclination to build what everyone else is building, such as another internal chatbot, simply because a foundational model like ChatGPT is popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:03:00">[31:03:00]</a>. The key is to determine if it truly solves a business need or if the AI interface should look fundamentally different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:00">[32:06:00]</a>.
*   **Problem-First Approach:** Product leaders often propose AI ideas just to "do AI" rather than focusing on a problem that AI can uniquely solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>. It's crucial to identify the actual problem and then evaluate if AI is the right tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:09:00">[36:09:00]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact:** There isn't a clear metric for measuring the impact of AI prototypes within a business, especially if it doesn't directly move revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:22:00">[37:22:00]</a>. Measuring the number of "shots" or experiments taken with AI can be an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:27:00">[37:27:00]</a>.
*   **Contextual Complexity:** Applying AI to seemingly simple problems can reveal unexpected complexity. For example, a Slackbot designed to alert on-call personnel for support problems proved difficult due to missing contextual information about team responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:08:00">[39:08:00]</a>.
*   **Balancing Automation with User Control:** Fully automating a process, even if possible, may not be desirable. The "Ikea effect" suggests users feel more empowered when they have some control over the experience, much like adding eggs to a cake mix made Betty Crocker more successful than a full "just add water" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>.
*   **"Waiting" vs. "Wandering":** Companies often "wait and see" for the next big AI model to emerge before building. However, a PM's role is to be a "Wanderer" – to explore the unknown, push boundaries, and find the right direction for the team, even when there's no clear path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
*   **Balancing Core Deliverables with Experimentation:** [[Overcoming challenges in AI product management | Successful AI PMs]] must "walk and chew gum" – continuously delivering customer value and moving business metrics while simultaneously creating space for prototyping, experimentation, and learning from failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:47:00">[44:47:00]</a>.

## [[Overcoming challenges in AI product management | Overcoming Challenges and Thriving as an AI PM]]

To [[overcoming_challenges_in_ai_product_management | thrive as an AI product manager]] and stand out among the top 5%, focus on:

*   **Curiosity and Building a Portfolio:** Driven by curiosity, learn the fundamentals of machine learning and AI, then apply that knowledge to build prototypes and products in industries of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. A portfolio of built products can demonstrate interest and skill to hiring managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>.
*   **Customer-Centricity:** Be "in love with the problem" that AI can solve for customers, rather than being enamored with the technology itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. The goal is to design the best customer experience and reduce friction, not just automate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic AI Application:** Identify where AI can create a "magical" experience by making products easier to use and lowering the barrier to creation, rather than simply trying to automate jobs entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>. This often means the best AI experiences don't always resemble traditional chatbots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>.
*   **Proactivity and Energy:** Bring positive energy to meetings and be willing to "do the thing" yourself, even if it's outside your direct responsibilities, such as directly reaching out to potential customers for insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:01:00">[52:01:00]</a>. This demonstrates commitment and builds empathy with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:52:00">[56:52:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing the "Wanderer" Mindset:** Get comfortable with uncertainty and the feeling of not knowing the right direction. The role of a PM, especially in AI, is to push the boundaries of what the company believes is possible and find the path by exploring, even if it feels "squishy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.
*   **Scaling Yourself with AI:** Utilize AI tools to amplify scarce signal through noise, like analyzing meeting transcripts, to make informed decisions and gain a "superpower" to be in many places at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.
*   **Having Fun:** Maintain curiosity, keep learning, and genuinely enjoy the process of building products for customers. This attitude can lead to faster iteration and greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>.

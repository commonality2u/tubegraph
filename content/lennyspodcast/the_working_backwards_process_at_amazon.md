The Working Backwards Process at Amazon

The "working backwards" process at Amazon is a foundational methodology for product development, focusing on starting with the customer's needs and problems rather than a preconceived solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. This approach aims to guide prioritization and ensure that product initiatives are deeply rooted in addressing a real customer pain point or business opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

### Core Philosophy

The essence of working backwards is to begin by obsessing over the problem you are trying to solve for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. It emphasizes understanding what you're trying to accomplish for the business or customer and starting there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>. This customer-obsessed starting point then guides the development of the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.

### Key Components: The Press Release and FAQ

Amazon enforces the working backwards principle through specific mechanisms, primarily the internal press release (PR) and the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.

*   **Press Release**: This document describes the product as if it were being announced publicly. It typically includes:
    *   A problem paragraph, outlining the core customer problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>.
    *   A solution paragraph, describing how the product solves that problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
    *   A customer quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
    The press release serves as a "trick" to ensure that teams think problem-first, rather than merely planning a launch announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.
*   **FAQ**: The FAQ section of the document details potential questions from various stakeholders (customers, press, internal teams) and their answers, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the product and its implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. It specifically focuses on "legitimate plans to succeed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.

### Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

The most common mistake when trying to apply the working backwards principle is starting with the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. Teams might have an idea of "what they want to build" or how existing technologies could be combined, and then they retrofit a problem to fit that solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

A tell-tale sign of this error is when discussions focus on "ingredients in the pantry"—existing technologies or services that *could* be combined—rather than on a compelling customer problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. A historical example of this mistake was an Amazon project internally called "ACIN to ACIN linking," which was ultimately unsuccessful because it was a solution in search of a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

According to Jeff Bezos, if a press release doesn't have a "problem paragraph," it suggests there isn't a genuine problem being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

### Implementation and Reviews

The working backwards process is often enforced through "working backwards reviews" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. These are meetings with leadership where the press release and FAQ are reviewed, and questions are asked to ensure alignment and validate the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>. For significant new products, these reviews can serve as a gate for approval and resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.

The process aligns with Jeff Bezos's criteria for investing in new ideas:
1.  Is it a big idea? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>
2.  Is it something the company *should* be doing (i.e., does it fit the company's mission/domain)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>
3.  Is there a legitimate plan to succeed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a> (This is addressed by the FAQ portion, demonstrating thoughtful consideration of internal components, finances, and technical hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>).

While the formal "press release and FAQ" mechanism is highly effective at Amazon, the *spirit* of working backwards—starting with the customer problem—can be applied in any organization, regardless of its documentation culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>. The choice of format (documents vs. slides) might vary depending on the company's environment and the preferences of its leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

The working backwards process is particularly useful for significant new products, where the overhead of the process is justified by the scale of the initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. It's a powerful tool for developing clear communication and thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

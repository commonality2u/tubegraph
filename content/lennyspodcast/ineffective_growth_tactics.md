Growth is a relatively new field, often leading to a focus on "growth hacks" that promise quick results in the age of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, many shared tips and tricks are out of context or specific to one example, failing to apply as general patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Elena Verna, an expert in B2B growth, highlights 10 [[common_misconceptions_in_growth_strategies | growth strategies and tactics]] that consistently fail, despite companies investing significant resources into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Common Ineffective Growth Tactics

### 1. Hiring a Growth Team Too Soon

There's a significant misconception that a growth team is necessary to initiate growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. This is "absolutely not true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Founders and founding teams must first figure out how to drive growth to their first million, five million, or even ten million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Companies may not even form growth teams until they reach $100-$200 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

Growth is not something that can be outsourced to an individual with a "shiny resume" expecting viral campaigns and high retention overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. This initial phase of growth needs to be "founder-led" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> for two main reasons:
*   **Solid Product-Market Fit (PMF)**: Before a growth team, a company needs a solution to a problem with customers who not only use the solution but also retain and stay with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Sufficient Data**: Growth teams cannot function without data. Ten users or customers is not enough data to do analysis, create hypotheses, and apply experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

The longer a company waits to hire a growth team, the better, as it trains the entire company to be responsible for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. For B2B SaaS, if revenue collection primarily happens through a sales team, hiring sales should precede growth hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. A growth team is more necessary when a company focuses on [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth]], aiming for the product to sell itself through freemium or trial acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### 2. Hiring a Head of Growth to Reverse Business Decline

Bringing in a head of growth to fix a business slowdown is often a failed strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. If the overall business is slowing down, the head of growth is "destined to fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a> because the underlying reasons are deeper than the absence of a growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

A growth team can optimize and potentially lift growth by 10-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. However, it cannot fix core product or marketing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Growth amplifies great product-market fit but is "absolutely helpless" if there are fundamental issues with product-market fit or go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. It's a waste of money, as a large growth team is needed to tackle existing product flows and interfaces, with a potential ROI of merely one-to-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

It is advisable to hire a head of growth only after the core product and marketing teams have managed to at least plateau the decline or show immediate "signs of life" in metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### 3. Rebranding or Redesigning for Growth

Using a rebrand or marketing site redesign to drive growth is a "spicy" and often painful mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Elena Verna has "never, ever once" seen a rebrand or redesign, especially of a marketing site, produce good performance results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

While there are valid reasons for rebranding (e.g., entering a new market, product evolution), these are often lagging indicators of necessary change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Companies often hire a new CMO who redesigns the brand based on personal taste, promising increased acquisition, but it "never materializes into anything meaningful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Such efforts involve significant agency money (often $1M+), extensive arguing over minor details, 8-10 months of development, and deliver "very lackluster results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

A redesign is typically a "stepping stone back" in performance, requiring substantial optimization to return to previous levels, let alone achieve upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. If undertaken, companies should anticipate a performance hit at launch and allocate 3-6 months for optimization *after* the launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### 4. Blindly Copying Competition

While understanding competitors and drawing inspiration from them is crucial, directly copying "best tactics" or flows because "they're doing better than us" is a common pitfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

Every product experience is unique to its customer and channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. Copying can lead to "very subpar results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>, often failing 95% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. It bypasses essential steps like ideation, user research, customer interviews, and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. Copying also ensures a company will "never be a leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>, only achieving mediocrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

> "There are patterns and there are [[effective_growth_frameworks | frameworks]] but there's no shortcuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

Benchmarks derived from competition are also dangerous because definitions for metrics (e.g., sign-ups, conversion rates) vary widely across companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. They should serve as inputs for decision-making, not blindly set goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

### 5. Believing Your Problem is Unique

A meta problem in growth is the belief that one's company's growth problems are unique and require re-engineering solutions from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. This is incorrect; "your problem has been felt by somebody somewhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

Starting from scratch is the "worst thing" one can do, wasting cycles on problems that have likely already been solved or experienced failures elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. Instead, leveraging existing knowledge is key:
*   **Examine Competition**: Look at how competitors are solving similar problems as input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
*   **Talk to Experts**: Find people who have solved similar problems and ask them directly about their experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   **Patternization**: Develop frameworks to solve problems that apply broadly, allowing rapid progress (e.g., 0-60% of a solution) and then authentic implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

### 6. Prioritizing Paid Channels Over Earned/Owned Channels

For [[Growth Hacking and Strategies | growth teams]] that own acquisition, prioritizing SEO, SEM, and social media advertising is a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. While these channels have value, they involve paying for distribution on platforms like Google or relying on algorithms that can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. Companies have "no control" over these channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

The top priority for a growth team should be creating "owned or earned channels" where competition is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. These include:
*   **Virality**: Product-led acquisition based on users attracting other users.
*   **Word-of-Mouth**: Organic spread of information.
*   **User-Generated Content (UGC)**: Content created by users that attracts new acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.

Examples like Dropbox's sharing model, where over 50% of acquisition comes from users sharing files, demonstrate the power of a stable, earned channel that competitors cannot replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. Ignoring these channels will lead to rising acquisition costs and increased reliance on external algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.

### 7. Not Evolving Growth Models / Relying on a Single Lever

Companies often start with a single growth model (e.g., [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth]] or sales-led) and stick to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>. However, not "overlaying every single way that you can grow through product, through marketing, and through sales as an evolution" is a "huge mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>.

Just as product-market fit needs continuous expansion, growth models also need to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. The "law of shitty click-throughs" indicates that over-optimizing the same thing yields minimal returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. Most growth loops have a limited lifespan (5-7 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>.

It's critical to continuously layer different growth models (product-led, marketing-led, sales-led) to diversify risk and avoid future slowdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>. Approximately 20-25% of a growth team's annual time should be dedicated to introducing a new growth loop or channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>. These new initiatives may take 6-18 months to show visible revenue, emphasizing the need to start early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>. Examples include harnessing user-generated content, creating referral mechanisms, or facilitating team invitations within the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>.

### 8. Not Hiring Advisors

Many companies fail to hire advisors, which is a significant missed opportunity for career and business amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>. Advisors provide access to networks and patterns, propelling progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a>. They act as additional inputs for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:20:00">[25:20:00]</a>.

In a field with information asymmetry like growth, where competitive concerns limit shared knowledge, advisors offer invaluable internal insights from their past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:23:00">[26:23:00]</a>. To vet advisors, it's recommended to conduct a paid workshop to see them in action and assess their ability to provide practical information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:00">[27:14:00]</a>. Ongoing retainers should be evaluated monthly for continued value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>.

### 9. Testing Everything (Excessive Risk Aversion)

While experimentation is a core process for growth teams, "experimenting on everything" is a "paralyzing disease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:18:00">[29:18:00]</a>. It slows down progress, velocity, and learning, leading to "terrible consequences" for a growth team's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>.

Key heuristics for when *not* to test:
*   **Low Volume Real Estate**: If collecting a sufficient sample size takes eight months, there's no point in testing; opt for "pre versus post" analysis instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>. Elena's rule of thumb: if the sample size cannot be collected in a month, don't test it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:00">[31:13:00]</a>.
*   **Trust Intuition**: People should rely more on their intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:00">[31:54:00]</a>. Not everything needs a scientific explanation to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:31:00">[32:31:00]</a>.
*   **High Traffic, High Impact**: Reserve rigorous A/B testing for "really big strategical pivot[s]" or "very high traffic real estate" where even small percentage differences mean millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:59:00">[33:59:00]</a>.

Otherwise, prioritize moving fast ("go go go") with "pre versus post" analysis (24-hour, 7-day, 28-day, or even yearly readouts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>. Failure will happen regardless of testing, and over-reliance on statistics for every decision can be debilitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>.

### 10. Quick Fire Round of Minor Ineffective Tactics

*   **Color Optimizations**: Testing shades of blue or other minor color changes is an outdated tactic from the early 2000s and yields no significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:03:00">[35:03:00]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Sign-ups for Acquisition**: Adding Google, Facebook, Slack, or Microsoft OAuth often only leads to a mix shift in user sign-up methods, not incremental acquisition, improved activation, or retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>. It's an important customer experience investment for developer products (e.g., GitHub OAuth) but not a [[growth_hacking_and_strategies | growth tactic]] for productivity products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>.
*   **One-Off Emails**: Stressing over single emails to customer groups is futile, as they "will never cause any lift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>. Email needs to be considered as a series, part of a broader communication strategy interacting with product communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05:00">[37:05:00]</a>.
*   **"Simplifying Onboarding" (Removing Friction for its Own Sake)**: While fixing "horrible friction" (confusing steps, high cognitive load) is important, simply removing steps or oversimplifying to the point of losing product identity is a "completely failed [[tactics_for_driving_growth_and_simplifying_complex_projects | growth tactic]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>. "Simplifying onboarding" is an action, not a problem; the real problem is confusion, getting lost, or lack of education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>. Simplication is a solution to a specific problem of "too much complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37:00">[39:37:00]</a>, not a problem in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:26:00">[39:26:00]</a>.

## Recommended Growth Frameworks

Elena Verna recommends three [[effective_growth_frameworks | growth frameworks]] that serve as patterns for ideation and problem definition:

1.  **Growth Loops**: This framework, popularized by Reforge (Brian Balfour, Casey Winters, Andrew Chen), emphasizes action-reaction cycles that generate another action, forming a self-contained flywheel for sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:59:00">[40:59:00]</a>.
2.  **Race Car Framework**: Developed by Lenny Rachitsky and Dan, this framework helps categorize different growth initiatives into engines (self-spinning loops), fuel (e.g., paid marketing), turbo boosts (e.g., large conferences), and lubrication (optimizations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:36:00">[41:36:00]</a>.
3.  **Adjacent User Theory**: From Behzod Ghodsi, this framework is powerful for considering growth evolution by attracting users outside the ideal customer profile (ICP) or core user, optimizing their experiences to add value without needing core product-market fit expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>.

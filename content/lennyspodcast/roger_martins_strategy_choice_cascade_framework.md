Roger Martin, Professor Emeritus at the Rotman School of Management and author of *Playing to Win*, is recognized as one of the world's most trusted strategy advisors and was named the world's number one management thinker by Thinkers50 in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>. He advocates for the importance of strategy being understood and applied not just by top executives, but also by individuals deeper within an organization, such as product managers, designers, engineers, and data scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:11">[02:28:11]</a>. He references Procter & Gamble as an example where brand managers, multiple levels down, make crucial strategic choices that impact brand performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

## Why is Strategy Hard?

Strategy is challenging for several reasons:
*   **Intellectually Challenging** It is an integrative activity where answers to multiple questions must fit together and reinforce one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:10">[07:10:10]</a>.
*   **Emotionally Intimidating** Strategy involves making definitive choices to do some things and explicitly *not* do other things, leading to accountability for those decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:01">[07:54:01]</a>.
*   **Poor Training and Education**
    *   Many business schools teach a "resource-based view of the firm," which Roger Martin considers "silly" and largely unused in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:04">[08:34:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:01">[09:49:01]</a>. This theory focuses on building resources with the assumption that "if you build it they will come," without guiding on *which* resources to invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.
    *   Strategy consulting firms also engage in less pure strategy work, focusing more on areas like post-merger integration or digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:04">[09:06:04]</a>.
    *   His own approach to strategy, which links where a company plays with its capabilities, is not taught in most leading business schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:02">[12:14:02]</a>.

## Defining Strategy

Roger Martin defines strategy as:
> An integrated set of choices that compels desired customer action. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:02">[17:46:02]</a>

The core idea is that a company controls many things (factories, R&D, advertising, hiring, etc.), but it cannot force customers to act. The job of strategy is to make decisions on controllable elements that will compel customers to take a desired action, such as purchasing a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:20">[18:10:20]</a>.

## The Strategy Choice Cascade Framework

The **Strategy Choice Cascade framework** consists of five interconnected questions that must be answered to craft an effective strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>:

1.  What is our **winning aspiration**?
2.  Where will we **play**?
3.  How will we **win**?
4.  What **capabilities** must we have?
5.  What **management systems** are required?

All five questions must be answered together, as they are interdependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>. This framework helps in producing a strategy that compels desired customer action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>.

### 1. What is Our Winning Aspiration?
This question focuses on what the organization is trying to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>. It contextualizes the choices to be made. An aspiration should ideally reflect a gap where customers are lacking something the company can provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] FigJam (Hypothetical)
> If a company like FigJam, a visual whiteboard collaboration tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>, were to define its winning aspiration, a weak approach would be "There's a big market over there; we'd like to get some" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:00">[42:27:00]</a>. A stronger aspiration would be to "satisfy core customers who love what we do but think it's too narrow, and if we could broaden that for them into this market, our customers would be very happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:25:00">[43:25:00]</a>. The aspiration should be framed in terms of how customers will benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:49:00">[43:49:00]</a>.

### 2. Where Will We Play?
This defines the playing field or battlefield where the organization will compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>. It involves making choices about:
*   **Customers:** Which specific customers or segments will be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:09:00">[44:09:00]</a>.
*   **Products:** What specific products or features will be offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:15:00">[44:15:00]</a>.
*   **Distribution Channels:** How the products will reach customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:24:00">[44:24:00]</a>.
*   **Vertical Stage / Value Chain:** Where in the value chain the company will operate (e.g., integrated product, component supplier, or assembler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:00:00">[45:00:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Four Seasons Hotels
> Four Seasons made a significant "where to play" choice in the 1980s by getting out of real estate development, hotel construction, and even owning land or hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:02:00">[46:02:00]</a>. Instead, they focused solely on **hotel management**, charging a management fee and allowing wealthy individuals to own the physical hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:44:00">[46:44:00]</a>. This strategic decision in the value chain allowed them to excel at their chosen core business.

### 3. How Will We Win?

This question addresses how the company will succeed in its chosen playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. Roger Martin, following Michael Porter, asserts there are primarily two routes to win:
*   **Lowest Cost Provider:** Offering products or services at a significantly lower cost than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.
*   **Differentiated Offer:** Providing unique value that customers perceive as superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.

If a company cannot achieve either of these, it will struggle to protect itself and is essentially "playing to play" rather than "playing to win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>. Signs of "playing to play" include customers perceiving your product as interchangeable with competitors, or being unable to compete on price if a competitor lowers theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Playing to Win
> *   **Low Cost:** [[startup_scaling_strategies | Vanguard]] is the world's biggest mutual fund company because it committed to being the lowest cost provider of index mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:14:00">[51:14:00]</a>. [[strategies_for_leading_and_scaling_design_teams | Southwest Airlines]], by having a single aircraft type (737s), point-to-point routes, and a unique labor strategy, achieved a cost position that other airlines could not match, forcing them to cede market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>.
> *   **Differentiated:** Lego holds an "insane brand" position, with market research showing that a toy store without Lego is not considered a "toy store" by kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:14:00">[25:14:00]</a>. This differentiation allows them to command a price premium and dominate category growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>.

Simply being "better" isn't enough; the differentiation must be hard for competitors to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>. This concept aligns with Warren Buffett's idea of "economic castles protected by unbreachable moats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:22:00">[39:22:00]</a>. Competitors either "can't do it or they won't do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:00">[32:06:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Moats / Barriers to Replication
> *   **Westlaw:** This online legal search service offers a superior search experience to Google because it has employed thousands of full-time lawyers for over a century to write "headnotes" with proprietary keywords for every US legal case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:30:00">[34:30:00]</a>. Replicating this would require an astronomical investment and a long history of giving free access to law schools, making it an insurmountable barrier for competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>.
> *   **Olay (P&G):** When P&G repositioned Olay as a mass-market prestige skincare brand, Estee Lauder's Clinique brand could have crushed them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>. However, Estee Lauder chose not to bring Clinique into mass channels because it would have cannibalized their existing prestige brands and alienated their department store partners â€“ an example of "counterposing" where a competitor can't easily mimic a strategy due to their existing structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.

Long-term competitive advantage is not fleeting when the strategy is multifaceted and hard to replicate. If capabilities and management systems are too simple, competitors will easily copy and "wreck your market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.

### 4. What Capabilities Must We Have?

These are the core competencies that must be in place to enable the company to win in its chosen way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. They are the practical enablers of the "how to win" theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:25:00">[54:25:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Four Seasons Hotels
> For Four Seasons to win by making guests feel "tended to better" and compensating for what they left at home, they needed a staff that could deliver customized service, taking more decisions at a lower level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:32:00">[55:32:00]</a>. This required a capability to retain employees far longer than the industry average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:01:00">[56:01:00]</a>.

### 5. What Management Systems are Required?

These are the operational processes, structures, and metrics that ensure the necessary capabilities are built and maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>. They support the organization's ability to consistently deliver on its "how to win" proposition.

> [!EXAMPLE] Four Seasons Hotels
> To achieve its desired staff capabilities, Four Seasons had to implement radically different management systems for recruiting, onboarding, and career development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:26:00">[56:26:00]</a>. This resulted in a 10% employee turnover rate, vastly lower than the industry's 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:35:00">[56:35:00]</a>, allowing them to train staff for long-term, high-quality, personalized service.

## [[becoming_more_strategic | Becoming More Strategic]]

Roger Martin offers several pieces of advice for individuals and organizations looking to improve their strategic thinking:

### Betterment Over Perfection
Instead of aiming to solve all problems at once, focus on "betterment." Identify the single most painful gap between current outcomes and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Then, use the Strategy Choice Cascade to make different choices (winning aspiration, where to play, how to win, capabilities, management systems) to close that specific gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. Solving one gap allows you to move to the next, making continuous, incremental improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Professor of the Year
> A professor consistently won "Professor of the Year" by simply cutting the lowest-rated session from his course every year and replacing it with something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. Over 25 years, this continuous "betterment" made his course exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>.

### Practice, Not Innate Talent
There is no such thing as a "great natural strategist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. Great strategists, like former P&G CEO A.G. Lafley, are simply those who have practiced strategy for decades and gained extensive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. Anyone willing to practice making different choices to solve problems will become a great strategist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.

### Don't Wait
The "worst thing to do is to wait" to focus on strategy, prioritizing "operational concerns" first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>. Those who constantly delay strategy rarely achieve anything significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.

### Customers will Triumph
Companies cannot "hold back the tide" of customer preferences forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. Even powerful firms like Google or Microsoft, despite their dominance, must eventually align with where customers want to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. For example, Microsoft's long-standing monopoly on PC operating systems didn't stop customers from shifting to smartphones and tablets, significantly reducing Microsoft's "share of minutes spent staring at a smart screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. Companies must figure out where customers are going and adapt, even if it's painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

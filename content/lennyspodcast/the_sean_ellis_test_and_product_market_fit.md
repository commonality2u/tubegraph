The **Sean Ellis Test**, often referred to as the [[understanding_the_framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] test, is a deceptively simple yet profoundly impactful idea in the startup world. Coined by growth pioneer Sean Ellis, it aims to help companies understand if they have [[the_concept_of_product_market_fit_and_its_evolution | product market fit]] by gauging user essentiality for a product [00:00:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, [01:19:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>).

## What is the Sean Ellis Test?

The core of the Sean Ellis Test is a single question posed to users: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" [00:00:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, [00:36:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>). Users are given a choice of responses:
*   Very disappointed [00:00:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, [00:41:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>)
*   Somewhat disappointed [00:00:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, [00:42:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>)
*   Not disappointed [00:03:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>)
*   Not applicable/I've already stopped using the product [00:03:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>)

The goal is to identify users who consider the product a "must-have" [00:03:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>).

### The 40% Threshold
Sean Ellis observed a pattern across various startups: if a high enough percentage of users (typically 40% or more) indicated they would be "very disappointed" without the product, those products generally performed well [00:00:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, [00:07:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>). Conversely, products with lower percentages tended to struggle [00:00:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, [00:08:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>). This 40% threshold emerged from observing patterns in many Silicon Valley startups [00:07:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>).

> [!info] Leading Indicator of Product Market Fit
> The Sean Ellis Test is considered a *leading indicator* of [[the_concept_of_product_market_fit_and_its_evolution | product market fit]]. The true, *lagging indicator* is consistent user retention â€“ whether people actually continue using the product [00:06:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, [00:08:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>). The test offers early insight without needing extensive analytics or long-term retention data [00:07:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>).

## Applying the Test for Product Improvement

The power of the Sean Ellis Test lies not just in the score, but in the qualitative insights it provides, aiding [[product_market_fit_strategy | product market fit strategy]] and user understanding.

### When to Use the Test
It can be applied at any company stage, even with a very first Minimum Viable Product (MVP) [00:08:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>). The ideal time to ask the question is to a random sample of users who have:
*   Activated the product (e.g., used it more than once) [00:22:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, [00:23:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>)
*   Used it recently (e.g., within the last week or two) [00:22:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>)
This ensures feedback from actual, engaged users who haven't yet churned [00:23:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>).

### Focusing on "Very Disappointed" Users
The most crucial step is to **deeply understand the "very disappointed" segment** [00:16:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>). These are your "must-have" users, and their feedback is invaluable for [[product_market_fit_and_user_understanding | product market fit and user understanding]].
*   **Identify Core Benefits**: Ask this segment: "What is the primary benefit that you get?" [00:15:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>). Start with open-ended questions, then use common themes to create multiple-choice options for a follow-up survey to a different group [00:15:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, [00:26:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>).
*   **Uncover "Why"**: Follow up with "Why is that benefit important to you?" This reveals the underlying problems the product solves and the context in which users operate [00:15:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, [00:16:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>). For instance, Zine (Inbox backwards) users valued its ability to find things faster in email because they were "drowning in email" [00:15:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>).
*   **Optimize Product & Messaging**: Use these insights to refine the product roadmap, streamline onboarding, clarify messaging, and target acquisition campaigns [00:17:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>).

> [!example] Case Study: Lookout
> Sean Ellis joined Lookout, a mobile security company, when its Sean Ellis Test score was only 7% [00:09:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>). By analyzing the 7% "very disappointed" users, they found a strong preference for antivirus functionality [00:10:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>).
> 1.  **Repositioning**: The product was rebranded to focus on antivirus [00:10:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>).
> 2.  **Streamlined Onboarding**: The first action for new users was setting up antivirus, immediately delivering the "You're Now Protected" message [00:11:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>).
> These changes boosted the score to 40% in just two weeks [00:11:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>). Six months later, it was 60%, and the company later achieved unicorn status [00:11:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>). This demonstrates that often, optimizing the onboarding and messaging for the right user experience is more impactful than tactical retention efforts [00:14:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>).

### Ignoring "Somewhat Disappointed" Users (Generally)
Sean Ellis's original advice was to generally ignore users who are "somewhat disappointed" because they perceive the product as a "nice-to-have" [00:26:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>, [00:41:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>). Trying to cater to them might dilute the product's core value for the "must-have" users, making it "good for everyone but not great for anyone" [00:42:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>).

> [!example] Superhuman's Nuance
> The team at Superhuman evolved this approach. They identified the core benefit valued by "must-have" users. Then, among the "somewhat disappointed" users who *also* sought that specific benefit, they asked what would make it a "must-have" for them [00:42:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>). This strategy helps move fence-sitters without diluting the core product experience [00:42:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>).

## Limitations and Nuances of the Test

While broadly applicable, the test has specific considerations:

*   **Product Type**: It's less effective for "one-off" products (e.g., a movie or a workshop) where continued use isn't expected [00:24:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>, [00:24:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>).
*   **Customer Investment**: High scores can sometimes be influenced by user "investment" or switching costs, rather than pure utility.
    *   **Webs.com**: Achieved 90% "very disappointed" scores due to the effort users put into building and customizing their websites [00:20:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>).
    *   **Eventbrite**: Event organizers had invested heavily once their event was set up, making switching difficult [01:13:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>).
    In these cases, while the score was high, the utility combined with switching costs drove the result [01:18:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>).
*   **Sample Size**: A minimum of 30 responses is generally recommended for reliable data [00:33:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>).
*   **Cultural Nuances**: The 40% threshold isn't rigidly fixed. Cultural differences can influence responses (e.g., Brazilians being more optimistic, Hungarians more pessimistic), meaning a different target percentage might be appropriate [00:27:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>, [00:28:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>).
*   **Business Model / Niche**: A high score indicates a product people care about, but the size of that "must-have" group determines the market opportunity [00:32:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>). A niche with highly passionate users might be preferable for long-term success, especially for innovative products battling "irrelevance" [00:35:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>).
*   **Feature-Level Application**: Some companies, like NuBank, apply this test not just to the overall product but also to individual features to ensure they are "must-haves" before launch [00:39:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>, [00:40:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>).

## Connecting to Growth Strategy

Sean Ellis views the Sean Ellis Test as fundamental to a comprehensive [[product_market_fit_strategy | product market fit strategy]] that drives sustainable growth. His approach prioritizes internal optimization before aggressive acquisition.

### The Growth Prioritization Framework
Sean Ellis's growth strategy, while often associated with "growth hacking," focuses on holistic, sustainable growth, not just one-off tactics [00:45:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>, [00:46:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>). The sequence of focus areas:

1.  **Understand Product Market Fit**: Deeply understand *who* your must-have users are, *how* they use the product, *what problem* it solves, and *what they used before* [01:48:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>, [01:49:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>).
2.  **Define North Star Metric**: Establish a metric that captures "units of value being delivered" to users. This metric should be quantifiable, increase over time, and correlate with revenue growth without being revenue itself [00:49:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>, [01:19:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>). Examples include "weekly rides" for Uber or "nights booked" for Airbnb [01:22:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a>).
3.  **Optimize Activation**: This is the most critical starting point [00:51:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>). Users are at highest risk of churning if they don't quickly experience the "aha moment" [00:53:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>).
    *   **Tactics**: Understand *why* users drop off by directly asking them (e.g., "Why didn't you download the software?") [00:57:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>). Focus on increasing desire and reducing friction [01:01:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>).
    *   **Case Study: LogMeIn**: Only 5% of sign-ups completed a remote control session (the activation moment) [00:55:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>). After a 3-month product freeze focused on improving onboarding, this jumped to 50%, enabling a 100x increase in profitable acquisition spend [00:55:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>).
4.  **Enhance Engagement & Referral**: Build a "value delivery engine" that leverages user behavior to drive growth [00:50:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>).
    *   **Word-of-Mouth**: This is crucial. A referral program is a great accelerator but only effective if the product already generates strong word-of-mouth [01:14:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>).
    *   **Freemium**: For freemium models to work, the free product must be so good it generates natural word-of-mouth, and the premium version must be sufficiently differentiated for upgrades [01:16:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>).
5.  **Optimize Revenue Model**: Ensure the business can monetize effectively [00:49:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>, [00:52:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>).
6.  **Scale Acquisition**: Only after the internal "flywheel" is efficient should a company "obsess" over acquiring new customers at scale [00:51:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>, [00:52:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>). This prioritizes efficiency in converting, retaining, and monetizing users, which is essential given today's competitive acquisition landscape [00:53:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>).

> [!info] The Power of "Right Questions at the Right Time"
> A core philosophy underpinning Ellis's work is that "a problem well stated is a problem half solved" [00:57:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>, [01:33:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>). This means asking the right qualitative questions to users, such as "How did you find this product?" and "How do you normally find products like this?" to uncover insights for [[developing_customer_discovery_methods_for_productmarket_fit | customer discovery methods]] and acquisition channels [01:10:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>).

## Tools and Resources
*   **Survey Tools**: While Sean Ellis had his own survey business (Qualaroo), simple tools like SurveyMonkey or in-product surveys can be effective for [[developing_customer_discovery_methods_for_productmarket_fit | developing customer discovery methods]] [00:36:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>). The focus should be on a good user experience for the survey itself [00:36:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>).
*   **Online Resources**: The original survey template was made freely available on `survey.io` (now `pmfsurvey.com`) [00:43:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>, [00:44:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>).
*   **Books**: Sean Ellis co-authored "Hacking Growth," one of the most popular growth books [01:43:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>).
*   **Courses**: `GoPractice.io` offers courses on growth, including one by Sean Ellis, focusing on asking the right questions [01:33:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a>).

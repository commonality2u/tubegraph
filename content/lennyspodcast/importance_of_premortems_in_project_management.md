Pre-mortems are a proactive tool used in project management to identify potential issues and risks before a project or initiative begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. The fundamental idea behind a pre-mortem is to anticipate what could go wrong, allowing teams to address these concerns in advance and avoid more significant problems later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. This approach contrasts with a "post-mortem" (or after-action review), which examines what went wrong *after* a launch or initiative has concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

The objective is to gather insights that would typically only emerge after a failure, but to do so preemptively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. If a pre-mortem is executed effectively, it can prevent the need for an "ugly post-mortem" later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

## Benefits of Conducting Pre-Mortems

Pre-mortems offer several key benefits for project teams:

*   **Psychological Safety** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>: Modern organizations often emphasize optimism and positivity, which can make team members hesitant to voice concerns or potential downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. A pre-mortem provides a safe environment where individuals are given "license" to think about and articulate what could go wrong, leading to a sense of catharsis and openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
*   **Shared Vocabulary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>: By introducing specific terms for different types of threats, pre-mortems help create a common language for discussing potential failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. This vocabulary encourages open discussion in future meetings, even outside the formal pre-mortem setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
*   **Early Issue Identification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>: Pre-mortems help teams identify issues that might not otherwise come up, preventing problematic situations down the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. This includes recognizing potential public backlash from announcements that might seem obvious to some team members but are not openly discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   **Time and Resource Saving** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>: Addressing potential problems before they occur can save significant time and resources that would otherwise be spent on damage control or backtracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>. Pre-mortems are considered a low-downside, high-upside activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

## Conducting a Pre-Mortem Meeting

A structured approach ensures the effectiveness of a pre-mortem:

### Timing and Attendees
Pre-mortems should be conducted early in a project or product's life cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. It's crucial to include representatives from every function involved in the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. For large launches, it can be beneficial to hold separate pre-mortems:
*   **Product/Engineering Focus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>: Involves all engineers, PMs, and design counterparts to discuss potential engineering-related issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.
*   **Go-to-Market Focus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>: Includes sales, support, marketing, PR, and core engineering leads to discuss market-related risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

For smaller initiatives, one combined meeting with all relevant parties is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.

### The Initial Prompt
The genius of the pre-mortem lies in its initial prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. The leader starts by asking the team to imagine a hypothetical scenario:
> "Imagine this project that we are working on has failed six months from now, or this launch we are doing has miserably failed. Let's just all imagine that. Now let's work backwards from there and ask ourselves, what went wrong? What could have contributed to this utter failure?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>

### Meeting Structure
The meeting should alternate between speaking and quiet time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. Participants are given quiet time (e.g., 5-10 minutes) to record their thoughts on potential failures in a shared document, without seeing others' entries initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. Then, participants go around the room and share their observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

A common approach involves categorizing potential issues using specific terms:
*   **Tiger** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>: A threat that could "kill" the project, representing actual problematic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
*   **Paper Tiger** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>: A seemingly significant threat that others might worry about, but the individual believes is not a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.
*   **Elephant (in the Room)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>: A potential issue that nobody is openly discussing, perhaps an unacknowledged reality or assumption that could lead to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.

After sharing, participants can vote on the "tigers" that they find most concerning, even if someone else mentioned them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

### Post-Pre-Mortem Actions
The leader is responsible for taking the generated output, prioritizing the identified threats, and creating a "post-pre-mortem action plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. The goal is not to solve every single problem, but to identify and plan for key threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. The leader should then share this plan with the team and remain accountable for progress on mitigation actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

## Impact on Project Outcomes
Implementing pre-mortems has been shown to help teams identify critical issues that would otherwise go unnoticed, potentially averting problematic situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>. It's a very inexpensive way to foresee challenges, primarily involving one meeting followed by prioritization and mitigating actions that would likely be necessary anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>.

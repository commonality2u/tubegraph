Effective communication is crucial for [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | leaders]] and anyone aiming to advance their career, as it is often considered "the job" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:59">[05:05:59]</a>. Poor communication can lead to confusion, skepticism, apathy, and avoidable questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. When communication doesn't yield the desired reaction, it's beneficial to reflect on one's own contribution and consider how to explain things more clearly, compellingly, and how to anticipate questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Communication is a skill that can be continuously improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:05">[08:07:05]</a>.

Broadly, communication encompasses two mediums: verbal (meetings, conversations, presentations) and written (emails, strategy documents, Slack messages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:14">[09:53:14]</a>. Its ultimate purpose is to achieve an ideal outcome, such as securing buy-in, facilitating team decisions, or moving initiatives forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:40">[10:26:40]</a>.

## Core Communication Frameworks and Principles

### The "Sales then Logistics" Approach

A common mistake is overestimating audience buy-in, leading directly into logistics or process details without first "selling" the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:07">[11:10:07]</a>. A "sales note" aims to generate excitement and agreement for an initiative, while a "logistics note" provides the "how-to" details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:04">[11:42:04]</a>. The correct order of operations is to first sell the idea by explaining its purpose, why it matters, and why now, and only then share the logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:07">[12:11:07]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Selling wins to executives
> A head of operations struggled to get her executive team to submit weekly wins to share with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:04">[12:28:04]</a>. She initially focused on the logistical details (document, deadline, format), which made it feel like another chore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. To improve, she should have started by explaining *why* it mattered: to celebrate team members, boost motivation, and ensure their work was seen and understood by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:08">[13:19:08]</a>. This frames the request as beneficial to them and their team, not just a favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

Even when an audience has generally bought in, a brief "selling" moment (1-2 minutes or a couple of sentences) can serve as a reminder of the purpose and importance, preventing a "cold start" and ensuring everyone is aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. It's about setting the context and stating what is needed from the audience upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. This is particularly important for leaders who have many demands on their time and need clear, concise information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.

### Conciseness

Conciseness is about the economy of words and the density of insight, not just a low word count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. A 300-word memo can be meandering, while a 1000-word memo can be tight and concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>. The key bottleneck to conciseness is often a lack of clarity in one's own thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Preparation for Conciseness
> The most consistent solution for conciseness, especially in real-time conversations or pitches, is **preparation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. Even a few minutes (30 seconds to a minute) before a meeting to ground oneself on its purpose, what to share, and what to achieve, can significantly improve focus and conciseness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>. For writing, consciously reminding oneself to be concise often leads to natural trimming and tidying of sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. Also, **always re-read your message** before sending it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>.

A poorly written memo has a significant "blast radius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:00">[25:41:00]</a>. A confusing Slack message in a channel of 15 people can lead to unproductive back-and-forth, wasting everyone's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>. Taking a moment to ensure clarity can enable those 15 people to "be off to the races" immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>.

### Signposting

**Signposting** involves using specific words, phrases, formatting, and overall structure to guide the reader and signal what's coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Common Signposting Words
> *   "For example" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>
> *   "Because" (to share logic/rationale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>
> *   "As a next step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:00">[28:15:00]</a>
> *   "First, second, third" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>
>
> In verbal communication, phrases like "The most important part to pay attention to is..." or "The part that we were most surprised by is..." can grab attention and signal importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a>.

Excessive formatting, such as bolding 30% of a note, negates its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>. Formatting should be used sparingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>. Overuse of bullets with sentence fragments is also a pitfall, as it often forces the reader to decipher meaning and can indicate that the writer hasn't fully thought through their ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>.

### Finding the Right Level of Confidence

Speakers often lean towards being either too confident or not confident enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:00">[42:42:00]</a>.
*   **Overconfidence** involves stating hypotheses as facts, e.g., "This *is* X" instead of "This *could be* X" or "This *might increase the likelihood* of X" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:53:00">[42:53:00]</a>. It's crucial to speak accurately about one's level of conviction and evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:12:00">[43:12:00]</a>.
*   **Underconfidence** means diminishing strong recommendations, e.g., "You can ignore everything I just said" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>. If there are strong reasons for a recommendation, it's irresponsible to act unsure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:33:00">[44:33:00]</a>.

The ideal is to have a point of view and a recommendation, back it up with evidence, logic, first principles, examples, or data, and be clear about the level of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01:00">[45:01:00]</a>. Frame initial ideas with phrases like "My initial thinking is..." or "Based on what we know, my hunch is..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>. This allows others to push back or align with specificity.

> [!CAUTION] The Single-Minded Martyr
> A "single-minded martyr" is someone who has a strong agenda for their recommendation and presents only supporting evidence, becoming frustrated when others are skeptical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:54:00">[46:54:00]</a>. This approach can miss the broader organizational context and priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:55:00">[47:55:00]</a>. More senior [[leadership_principles_and_career_success | leaders]] understand that the best decision for the company might not be their immediate win, especially if it doesn't align with current company priorities like retention or revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:36:00">[48:36:00]</a>.

### The Most Obvious Objection (MOO)

The MOO framework stands for **Most Obvious Objection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:24:00">[50:24:00]</a>. It addresses situations where communicators are blindsided by questions or objections in meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:34:00">[50:34:00]</a>. By taking a few minutes to anticipate obvious objections before presenting an idea, one can often prepare for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:46:00">[50:46:00]</a>. This involves knowing your own argument inside out, including potential counterarguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:03:00">[51:03:00]</a>. Anticipating objections allows you to volunteer information upfront or frame your message to mitigate concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:11:00">[52:11:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] MOO as a Mental Filter
> Using MOO as a mental filter encourages thinking a few steps ahead in a structured way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:59:00">[51:59:00]</a>. It's a tactical way to empathize with your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:40:00">[52:40:00]</a> and helps to strengthen your own thinking by revealing potential gaps in your plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:57:00">[52:57:00]</a>.

### Staying Calm and Handling Unexpected Questions

When faced with unexpected questions or a lack of immediate answers in high-stakes conversations:
*   **Don't make something up** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:48:00">[54:48:00]</a>.
*   Instead of defaulting to "I'll get back to you," try to **answer a similar question** in the likely direction of the person's concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:48:00">[55:48:00]</a>.
*   **Validate why they are asking** that question to uncover the "question behind the question" or the underlying concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:54:00">[55:54:00]</a>.
*   **Probe** for more information and answer in a general direction to keep the conversation going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31:00">[56:31:00]</a>.
*   **Reflect back their question** to buy time and ensure understanding, e.g., "Let me just make sure I understand what you're looking for..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:57:00">[56:57:00]</a>.

### Managing Up

[[Leadership principles and career success | Managing up]] is a crucial skill at all career levels, becoming even more important with seniority due to increased ambiguity and broad mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:34:00">[59:34:00]</a>. The most leveraged way to manage up is by **sharing your point of view** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>.

> [!TIP] Sharing Your Point of View
> Instead of asking "What should we do?", propose "Here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps? Am I thinking in the right direction?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. This reduces the manager's cognitive load and demonstrates active, strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. It's about moving from a reactive posture to proactively sharing observations, hypotheses, and insights, even for junior team members who have close proximity to issues or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.

### Giving Feedback: "Strategy not Self-Expression"

When giving feedback, the goal is **behavior change**, not self-expression or venting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. Often, people give feedback when frustrated, which can turn into counterproductive venting sessions that demoralize or make the recipient defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>.

> [!TIP] Focus on Behavior Change
> Trim feedback to only the part that motivates the person to change, helping them understand the benefit to themselves and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>. This often means cutting 90% of what one initially wants to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>. It's helpful to vent frustrations elsewhere (e.g., to a therapist or friend) before the conversation, to ensure one enters the discussion calm and focused on the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

### Delegating with High Standards: The CEDAF Framework

The **CEDAF** framework helps maintain high standards while delegating:
*   **C - Comprehension:** Have you provided everything needed for the person to understand the task and desired outcome? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>
*   **E - Excitement:** Is the task explained in a way that generates excitement, perhaps by connecting it to larger project goals or individual career growth? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>
*   **D - Derisk:** Have obvious risks been identified and mitigated? This could involve breaking a large task into smaller parts to check direction early, or proactively addressing potential misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.
*   **A - Align:** Is there an opportunity for the delegate to ask questions and ensure mutual understanding? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>
*   **F - Feedback:** How can the feedback loop be shortened as much as possible? This means checking in frequently, perhaps daily or even brainstorming initial steps within the same conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>.

Using CEDAF acts as a mental checklist to ensure a thorough delegation process, leading to better outcomes and saving time in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>.

### The Swipe File

A **swipe file** is a collection of inspiration that can be referred back to later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. For communication, this might include well-articulated phrases, strategic statements, or effective arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. The act of adding to a swipe file, even without frequent review, trains one to be more alert to noticing what's working well and why, encouraging learning and borrowing effective techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.

## Overall Approach to Communication

Improving communication involves an upfront investment of a "little bit more time" to save significant time and friction later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>. All these "minor" things compound to create a large impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. While others might claim diminishing returns too early on basic skills, investing in seemingly boring or simple communication improvements can yield significant "alpha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>.

> [!TIP] Practical Application
> Don't try to incorporate too many tactics at once; instead, pick one thing to try and practice it consistently across different settings before moving on to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. Approach it with a hypothesis-driven, experimental mindset, almost like a game, observing reactions to different framing or phrasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. Pay attention to how quickly and enthusiastically you get the desired reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

### AI as a Communication Tool

AI tools like Claude can be valuable thought partners for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. They can generate initial drafts for emails or responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:33">[01:20:33]</a>. Providing specific context and outlining the desired outcome (e.g., "I'm not sure how to tell this person no, but I want to be respectful") leads to much better output than vague prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>. AI can also facilitate faster feedback loops by breaking down tasks and asking clarifying questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">[01:15:58]</a>.

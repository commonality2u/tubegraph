A great [[Developing and deploying a product strategy | strategy]] inherently contains tension at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This tension is not to be confused with stress; rather, it is fundamental to all art forms and innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

## Understanding Tension in Strategy

Tension, as opposed to stress, is the uncertainty of "it might not work," creating an anticipation for completion or resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. Stress, on the other hand, is the conflict of wanting to do two things simultaneously, such as wanting to leave a job but needing to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

When a new product is launched, a promise is made about what it can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. This creates tension as the user imagines how their life might improve if that promise holds true. The tension then lies in whether the promise was truthful and if the product will actually work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

### Examples of Tension

Historically, products have leveraged this tension to engage customers:
*   **PF Flyers sneakers** The promise was that these sneakers would make a child fast enough to escape a bully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. The tension was the hope that the product would deliver on this crucial promise, a promise that, in this instance, was not entirely kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. This highlights the importance of keeping the promises made to build a strong brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Google Search** At its launch, Google made the promise that by simply typing what you want, you would find it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. This was a direct contrast to competitors like Yahoo, which offered hundreds of links on their homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Google's strategy created tension by promising a more efficient and direct path to information, a promise that it consistently delivered upon, making it [[The Importance of Being Remarkable | remarkable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   **Tesla Model S** The design choice of door handles that "popped out" was noticeable and created conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. This initial curiosity led to demonstrations of the car's "ludicrous mode," where the rapid acceleration transformed the passenger's experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. This experience was fun for the driver and told a compelling story to the passenger, fostering customer traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

### Promises and Brand Building

A brand is defined as a promise – what one expects from a company, and what one would miss if it were gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Building a brand requires standing for something and clearly defining what you **don't** do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

For any company, including those utilizing AI, the core focus should be on "what's in this for the user?" and making a "difficult, remarkable promise" that can be consistently kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Breaking a promise even once can damage a brand's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. This principle also applies to fostering loyalty; true loyalty exists when customers would pay extra to stick with a brand, not just for superficial incentives like points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

### The Importance of Being Remarkable

The concept of the "Purple Cow" emphasizes the necessity of being [[The Importance of Being Remarkable | remarkable]] – literally, "worth making a remark about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. For a product to succeed, especially in a world where direct marketing is less effective, it needs to be so valuable that users' lives improve if they discuss it with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. This word-of-mouth spread is crucial for customer traction, which is the best indicator of a startup's potential success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

## Strategic Thinking and Systems

[[Becoming more strategic | Becoming a strategic thinker]] involves the ability to perceive the underlying "systems" that govern interactions and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Systems are largely invisible and taken for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. They create culture – "the way things are around here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>.

When something feels scary, it's often because the system intends for it to be perceived that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. True strategic thinking involves questioning why something is scary, identifying the system that would be offended, and determining if one is leveraged enough to challenge or change that system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

[[Elements of a successful strategy | A successful strategy]] often means choosing the "wave" to surf rather than solely focusing on one's surfing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. By choosing the right conditions or markets, one significantly increases the likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. To avoid mediocrity, it is essential to do something different from others, otherwise, one will achieve the same average results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

## Core Strategic Choices in Product Development

For product people, four critical choices determine the product's future and the trajectory of their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>:

1.  **Choose your customers:** Defining the smallest viable audience – their language, finances, problems, and disposition – shapes the entire product and its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
2.  **Choose your competition:** Understanding the competitive landscape dictates the boundaries of operation. Competing against entities like Walmart, which prioritize low prices, means accepting those specific dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
3.  **Choose the source of validation:** Deciding whom to please – whether a boss or the agreed-upon target customers – fundamentally alters the product development process and subsequent interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
4.  **Choose your distribution:** The chosen method of distribution, particularly relevant in software (e.g., physical retail vs. digital download platforms like Steam), significantly impacts the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

These four choices are interconnected and cannot be changed at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. They must be consciously made from the outset, defining "who are you for, and who are you not for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

## Leadership and Service

The essence of leadership is to "do what you believe, paint a picture of the future, [and] go there," with people following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. However, this painting of the future must be rooted in empathy, depicting "where *they* want to go," not merely where the leader desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. Professionals operate from a place of non-narcissism, understanding that they are not entitled to market share or a good price just because they worked hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. Instead, their role is to be of service, opening doors for people to reach goals they already desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

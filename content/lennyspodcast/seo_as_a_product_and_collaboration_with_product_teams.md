Eli Schwarz, a growth advisor specializing in SEO, advocates for a paradigm shift in how companies approach Search Engine Optimization. He argues that with the rise of AI answers in search results, traditional SEO tactics focused solely on rankings and long-form content are becoming less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead, SEO should be viewed as a product, deeply integrated with the user's self-discovery journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Viewing SEO as a Product

Schwarz asserts that SEO is not a "dark art" but a simple product question that [[collaboration_between_research_and_product_teams | product managers]] should address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The core idea is to think about how a product is positioned to a user who is engaged in a self-discovery journey through search, rather than finding a product through social channels or ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. If a company cannot identify what a user would search for to find their product, then they shouldn't pursue SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

This shift in thinking is critical because AI-generated answers, such as Google's AI Overviews, are increasingly integrated into search results. These overviews provide direct answers to top-of-funnel queries, reducing the need for users to click on external links for initial discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. While this might seem like an "apocalypse" for traditional SEO, it instead emphasizes the need for content to be relevant at the mid-to-bottom of the funnel, where users have clearer intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

The objective of product-led SEO is to ensure content remains relevant and actionable, solving a user's problem directly and leading them toward conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## Steps to Implement Product-Led SEO

Eli Schwarz outlines three key steps for companies looking to succeed with product-led SEO in the new AI paradigm:

1.  **Be the User (Customer Empathy):** The most crucial, yet often missed, step is to deeply understand the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. This means understanding what problem a user is trying to solve that would lead them to search for a product or solution. For example, SurveyMonkey employees were encouraged to use their own product to build empathy for why customers used the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.
2.  **Decide on the Asset to Create:** Once the user and their needs are understood, the next step is to determine what asset (content or feature) will best meet those needs in a search context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. This asset should be a product that showcases how the company's offering can solve the user's problem.
3.  **Envision and Build the Product for SEO:** This involves integrating design, engineering, and user research resources, overseen by a [[collaboration_between_research_and_product_teams | product manager]], to build the SEO asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. The inputs for SEO should be treated as product requirements, not just content creation.

## Examples of Product-Led SEO Success

*   **Zapier:** Early on, Zapier realized users weren't searching for "Zapier" directly, but for ways to connect applications like "Gmail to Salesforce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. They built programmatic pages at scale that showcased these specific integrations, effectively becoming a product that solved a recognized need, leading to legendary SEO success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
*   **Tinder:** Instead of trying to rank for broad terms like "online dating," Tinder focused on the core problem their users were trying to solve: loneliness in new cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. They created localized pages (e.g., "online dating in Dubai") that offered suggestions for dates and positioned Tinder as the solution to the loneliness problem, directly linking SEO to their product's utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
*   **Quora:** By removing login walls and displaying answers directly on search results, Quora quadrupled its traffic within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. They also implemented a categorized HTML sitemap, allowing search engines to easily navigate and index their vast database of questions and answers, making their content discoverable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>.
*   **SurveyMonkey:** As a freemium tool, SurveyMonkey successfully generated hundreds of millions in revenue annually from organic traffic by offering templates for various surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Users searching for specific survey templates found the solution, signed up for free, and then converted to paid users if the tool met their needs.

## When SEO May Not Be the Right Investment

Schwarz cautions that not every company, particularly B2B SaaS firms, should invest heavily in SEO. The critical factor is whether the product's purchase journey aligns with a search-driven discovery.

*   **B2B SaaS:** For complex products like Mixpanel or Google Cloud, users typically don't make a purchase decision based solely on a Google search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>. These products often require a committee decision, a sales motion, and significant integration, making direct online conversion from SEO unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. Investing in SEO for such products may yield traffic but not conversions, leading to a poor ROI compared to other channels like direct sales or brand marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.
*   **Transactional Local Businesses:** Restaurants, for example, may not need a website or SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. Users looking for immediate needs like "pizza near me" typically use apps like Google Maps, DoorDash, or Uber Eats, not a restaurant's individual website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>.

## Collaboration and Measuring Success

Effective product-led SEO requires strong [[collaboration_between_research_and_product_teams | collaboration between product and marketing teams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. Product teams need to consider how to position their offering for users engaged in a self-discovery journey through search.

Measuring success in product-led SEO goes beyond vanity metrics like rankings or traffic volume. Instead, focus on conversion metrics that align directly with business goals:
*   **Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs):** For B2B companies, track the number of leads generated directly from SEO traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue/Conversions:** For e-commerce or freemium models, track direct sales or sign-ups attributed to organic search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
*   **Brand Mentions/Links:** While not a direct conversion, these can indicate brand building and authority, which indirectly support SEO efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

Eli emphasizes that traffic alone, without conversion, is a "total waste of time" for non-media companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. The emphasis must be on the user's intent and how the SEO effort integrates into their journey towards becoming a customer.

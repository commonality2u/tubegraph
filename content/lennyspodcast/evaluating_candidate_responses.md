## Insights from Industry Leaders on Evaluating Responses

### Aika Deshmukh (Head of Product, Rally)
**Question**: "What do you attribute your success to, and you can't say luck?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
**Evaluation**: Aika looks for self-awareness and curiosity. A strong answer shows that a person has reflected on why they are where they are today, revealing a lot about how they think about the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Jeff Charles (Head of Product, Ramp)
**Question**: "What's the hardest thing you've ever done?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
**Evaluation**: Jeff aims to understand what "hard" means to the candidate, why it was difficult, how they overcame it, and how they collaborated with others, as well as their personal agency in the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This reveals their definition of difficulty and their effort in overcoming challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Shashir Marocha (CEO & Co-founder, Coda)
**Question**: "A group of scientists has invented a teleportation device. They've hired you to bring this to market. What do you do?" (Followed by, "They will answer only two of your questions. What two questions do you ask?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
**Evaluation**:
*   Initially, he observes if candidates start asking many questions, which is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   The key is how quickly they identify the one or two most impactful (or "iG") questions when limited to only two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   An exemplary answer involved asking: "Is it safe enough for humans?" and "Is it more expensive (CAPEX or OPEX) to buy or to run them?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This demonstrates the ability to form comprehensive strategies based on minimal critical information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   Shashir notes that children are often very good at simplifying these problems to identify core questions, a skill adults sometimes lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   He advises looking for [[interview_questions_for_candidates | interview questions]] everywhere, identifying the core questions that drive an answer in any situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Yuki Yamashita (Chief Product Officer, Figma)
**Question**: "Describe to me a time when you were part of a controversial product decision." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>
**Evaluation**: Yuki looks for the candidate's ability to:
*   Set up the conflict and explain why the problem was important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   Represent both sides of the conflict in an even-keeled way, demonstrating an ability to understand different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   For general "big problem" questions, he wants to feel compelled to work on that problem after hearing the candidate's story, regardless of how mundane the problem sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   A great product manager can make any problem seem "existential" and interesting, rallying others to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This highlights the importance of storytelling and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Katie Dill (Head of Design, Stripe), Ki Sarin (CEO, Linear), & Camille Hurst (Product Leader, Spotify)
**Question**: "Tell me what work you are most proud of." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
**Evaluation**: This question helps understand a candidate's:
*   Taste and judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   Motivations and what they view as a good outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   What they like to do and where their "gravity pulls them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   Their values and how they think about things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   Their motivations, work ethic, and what "good" looks like to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### J Z (Head of Product, Webflow)
**Question**: [[behavioral_interview_techniques | Behavioral questions]] about navigating challenging or ambiguous situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
**Evaluation**:
*   Good answers demonstrate the ability to put structure and a way forward through ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   Candidates should be seeking help and inputs, rather than proclaiming a single, clear path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   She looks for candidates who can chart a path, explain how they learned and why they chose that path, and identify small milestones to assess if the path is working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

### Noah Weiss (Chief Product Officer, Slack)
**Question**: "What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product team?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>
**Evaluation**: Noah seeks insights that aren't commonly known or "read on a Medium post" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. He wants to know *what* they learned, *how* they learned it, *how* it works, and *how* they apply it, often gaining amazing inspiration from the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Ben Williams (Advisor, Product-Led Growth Startups)
**Question**: "Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
**Evaluation**:
*   While many default to discussing roles or titles, Ben seeks signals of humility and self-awareness regarding areas of personal and professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Candidates who are open about where they need to grow are highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **General Observation**: Throughout interviews, Ben looks for **curiosity**. Good product managers ask "why" as much as a six-year-old child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Candidate's Question**: "Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> This is a great way for a candidate to test alignment of their personal values with the interviewer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### Melum Quan Burwitz (Head of Growth, Deel)
**Question**: "What would your siblings say about you?" (If no siblings, "What would your parents say about you?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>
**Evaluation**: This question reveals what a candidate thinks others perceive of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Melum looks for sincerity and self-awareness. An overly idealized answer (e.g., "very organized," "brings family together") may be a red flag. An answer that acknowledges minor flaws or "weird things" demonstrates self-awareness and humbleness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### Paige Castello (Co-Head of Product Management & Head of AI, Asana)
**Question**: "Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it, and what did you do about it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>
**Evaluation**: This question assesses a candidate's mindset and how they talk about and evaluate situations when things go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. It offers insight into how they perceive themselves when facing difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### Nikhil Singal (VP of Product, Facebook)
**Question**: "What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> (Can be adapted to roles, industries, or topics like [[evals_and_their_importance_in_ai_product_management | AI]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
**Evaluation**:
*   Nikhil uses this to break the "interview mindset" where candidates try to predict what the interviewer wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   This question forces candidates to be genuinely opinionated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
*   It's a "save question" to identify authentic, high-quality people who might otherwise be dismissed for providing conventional answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

### IO Omalo (Chief Product Officer, Carbon Health)
**Question**: "Tell me something you did that worked out, but not for the reason you thought it would work." OR "Tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>
**Evaluation**: The core goal is to gauge the candidate's **introspection**. IO looks for people who are reflective about their decisions, understand why they succeeded or failed, and incorporate those learnings to make different decisions in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

### Scott Belsky (Chief Strategy Officer, Adobe)
**Question 1**: "Something people have learned about themselves that reveal a limitation in how they work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>
**Evaluation 1**: This tests introspection and whether a person can be open and reflective when they hit their limits or struggle, rather than blaming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.
**Question 2**: "Do you consider yourself lucky?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>
**Evaluation 2**: Scott finds this question fascinating as it can reveal insecurities. Those comfortable admitting they were lucky often possess a healthy self-awareness, acknowledging the role of privilege and fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

### Lauren Izzo (Head of Growth, Notion)
**Question**: "Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>
**Evaluation**: Lauren seeks to understand how candidates define "impact" and what it means to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. For a growth practitioner, a good answer often reflects intrinsic motivation for having a business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

### Paul Adams (Chief Product Officer, Intercom)
**Advice for Reference Calls**: When talking to a referee, ask: "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>
**Evaluation**: This is an "amazing question" because the referee cannot dodge it and it elicits incredibly honest and revealing answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

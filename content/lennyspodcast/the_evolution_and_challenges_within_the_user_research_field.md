The user research field is currently undergoing a "Reckoning," a period of significant change and adaptation. This "Reckoning" is largely driven by recent layoffs within the user experience (UX) and user research sectors, prompting a re-evaluation of how user research is integrated and leveraged by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## User-Centered Performance

A key challenge identified in the field is "user-centered performance," which refers to customer obsession or user-centered practices that are symbolic rather than genuinely focused on learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This often involves performing actions to signal customer obsession, without a true intention to make different decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

Examples of user-centered performance include:
*   Product Managers (PMs) asking researchers to run a "quick user study" at the end of a product process merely to validate assumptions, when it's already too late to impact decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This is often a "check the box" exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.
*   Executives or product people requesting "executive listening sessions" or focus groups primarily to "get close to the customer," which is largely performative and not focused on genuine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.
*   A mindset of "validation" rather than "falsification" â€“ where PMs and designers seek to confirm their ideas rather than to be proven wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

This performative approach signifies a broken system where user research is not driving the value or impact it should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Types of User Research

To understand the challenges, it's helpful to categorize user research into three types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>:

1.  **Macro Research:** This is big-picture, strategic, business-focused, and forward-looking. It involves innovation, market analysis, competitor review, and long-term product direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Examples include understanding the overall competitive landscape, doing concept car-type projects, or engaging with strategic planning and total addressable market (TAM) studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
2.  **Micro Research:** This is highly focused, often technical usability research that aims to enable a high-quality, pixel-perfect product. It includes laser-focused research to understand A/B test results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This type of research can drive significant business value very quickly, sometimes within 48 hours, by identifying and fixing functionality problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.
3.  **Middle-Range Research:** This occupies a "blob" space where research questions are at a "middle altitude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. It often involves understanding user thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. While interesting, this type of research often proves "not impactful enough for the business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. It can lead to interesting but hard-to-operationalize results, confirm post-hoc biases, and enable performative user-centeredness without actual change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

The "Reckoning" suggests that the industry has been doing too much of the problematic middle-range research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This was perhaps exacerbated during a "zero interest rates phenomenon" (ZIRP) era when companies hired many researchers without properly integrating them or defining how research could drive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Challenges for User Researchers

User researchers face several significant challenges:

*   **Service Function:** Many researchers are treated as a "service function," called in reactively at the end of a product process, rather than being engaged from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This limits their input on framing the right questions for maximum business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Relationship with Product Managers:** The [[the_relationship_between_product_managers_and_user_researchers | relationship between product managers and user researchers]] is often challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. PMs sometimes hold tropes about research, such as:
    *   "Research just slows us down" or "Research is too slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. Good research can be fast and actually speeds up product development by getting things right the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
    *   "I can do my own research; why do I need researchers?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a> While talking to users is important, professional researchers can discern powerful insights from idiosyncratic feedback and avoid bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
    *   "A/B test everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. While A/B tests can show causal relationships, they rarely explain *why* something happened. Qualitative research provides the "how and why" necessary for future product improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
    *   Reliance on the apocryphal Henry Ford quote about asking users for faster horses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. This quote misrepresents research, as good researchers do not simply ask users what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.
    *   "We knew this already" or "That was obvious," a manifestation of post-hoc bias or hindsight bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>.
*   **Over-extension:** Many researchers are the sole researcher on teams with many PMs and designers, leading to too many projects and diluted quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>.
*   **Misunderstanding and Powerlessness:** Researchers often feel misunderstood, sidelined, or forgotten, leading to a sense of powerlessness when facing layoffs or a lack of influence on the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>.

## Strategies for Evolution

To adapt and thrive, the user research field needs to evolve in several ways:

### For Researchers:

*   **Develop Diverse Skills:** Beyond traditional qualitative research, strong researchers should possess five key tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>:
    1.  **Formative/Generative UX Research:** Forward-looking, innovation-focused, open-ended, and ethnographic research (e.g., observing product use in the field) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
    2.  **Evaluative Research:** Usability testing focused on evaluating products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.
    3.  **Rigorous Survey Design:** The best scaled way to gather responses from communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
    4.  **Applied Statistics:** Essential for understanding A/B test results and working in a data-rich environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
    5.  **Technical Skills:** Historically SQL for running queries, now potentially prompt engineering for interacting with generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   **Deep Business Knowledge:** Researchers need to be more profit-focused and understand business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This involves reading quarterly reports, listening to shareholder calls, understanding company strategies, OKRs, metrics, and conversion funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. By understanding the business context, researchers can propose pointed research questions that drive maximum business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
*   **Build Strong Relationships:** Researchers must actively build relationships with product and design partners to be integrated into the process from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Ruthless Prioritization:** Researchers, with their partners, need to learn to say "no" and focus on a few, highly impactful projects, protecting their time to do a good job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.
*   **Effective Communication:** Researchers need to be excellent communicators, adapting their presentations to different audiences (e.g., a PM vs. a CEO) to effectively convey insights and drive influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.
*   **Embrace Falsification:** Shift the mindset from validating assumptions to seeking to be wrong, which is the path to real learning and product improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

### For Companies and Product Teams:

*   **Integrate Research Fully:** Companies must restructure product development to [[integrating_user_research_effectively_into_product_development | integrate user research effectively into product development]] from the start, rather than treating it as a service function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Researchers should have consistent relationships with product teams and be active participants in decision-making meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Unify Insights Functions:** Avoid siloing different research disciplines (UX, consumer insights, market research, data science, customer service feedback) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. Instead, integrate them into a single "insights machine" to provide a holistic view and avoid overwhelming product teams with disparate data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.
*   **Common Metrics for Success:** Ensure that researchers, PMs, engineers, and designers share the same set of metrics for success, fostering a unified goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **Balance Intuition with Evidence:** While intuition is valuable, PMs and leaders should be aware of its biases and blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. They should engage in "system two" (slow, methodical) thinking and leverage the "wisdom of the crowd" by bringing in diverse sources of information and judgment to check their gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.
*   **Value Micro Research:** Recognize the significant business value of fast micro-level research, such as usability testing, which can quickly improve conversion rates and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.
*   **Strategic Hiring:** While there's no "right ratio" of researchers to other roles, companies should prioritize creating constant research partnerships where needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>. A single researcher can drive incredible value even at early-stage companies by making teams go faster and providing insights that are otherwise impossible to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>.

The future of user research is bright, but it requires both researchers to adapt their skills and companies to build more inclusive and integrated models for insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

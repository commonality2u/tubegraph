The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is a concept designed to scale [[agile_methodologies_and_their_historical_context | agile methodologies]] like Scrum to large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It emerged from the desire to figure out how to scale Scrum and other processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While SAFe aims to bring rigor and process to large-scale development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>, many experts, including product management legend Melissa Perry, advise against its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.

## Origin and Purpose
SAFe originated from a more structured approach to [[agile_methodologies_and_their_historical_context | Agile]] called Rational Unified Processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. It is one of several scaling frameworks, alongside Less and Scrum at Scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. SAFe was effectively marketed as an all-encompassing guide for integrating all [[agile_methodologies_and_their_historical_context | agile]] teams using Scrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. Executives at very large enterprises often favored SAFe because it prescribed a detailed operating model for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

Many large companies, especially those that did not traditionally grow up building software (e.g., banks, telecom, pharmaceutical companies), turn to SAFe or similar frameworks to implement rigor at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. They seek a "handbook" to manage technology organizations when they are new to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.

## How SAFe Works
SAFe aims to tie multiple teams together at scale within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. Key components and roles within SAFe include:
*   **Release Trains**: Groups of [[agile_methodologies_and_their_historical_context | agile]] teams are pulled together into "release trains" to ensure smooth feature launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.
*   **Big Room Planning (PI Planning)**: All teams within a Release Train gather quarterly to break down and commit to what they will work on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   **Product Owner (PO)**: The PO is part of the [[agile_methodologies_and_their_historical_context | agile]] team, sitting with Scrum Masters (team coaches) and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Their role is to keep the backlog full for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.
*   **Product Manager (PM)**: The PM sits with a system architect and a Release Train Engineer, separate from the immediate [[agile_methodologies_and_their_historical_context | agile]] team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. The PM is typically responsible for discovery work and feeding information to the Product Owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

## Challenges and Criticisms
Melissa Perry highlights numerous [[common_challenges_and_solutions_in_product_management | challenges and frustrations]] with SAFe:

*   **Overkill and Rigidity**: SAFe is often described as overkill due to its excessive overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Its rigid, "by-the-book" approach hinders adaptation and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.
*   **Process Over Outcomes**: SAFe focuses heavily on processes and meetings, leading to teams talking *about* work rather than achieving tangible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. This can cause delays in critical initiatives, as seen in a water company in the Netherlands that went bankrupt due to slow deployment of a new invoicing system while caught up in SAFe processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.
*   **Lack of True Product Management**: SAFe does not effectively describe how to perform essential product management activities like customer discovery, market research, or data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Product Owners often become mere "order takers," translating requirements into user stories without deeper strategic involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
*   **Split Roles and Career Path Challenges**: SAFe creates a distinct split between Product Owners and Product Managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. This often means Product Owners lack exposure to strategy, market research, and customer interaction, hindering their [[challenges_in_transitioning_to_product_management | transition to product management]] and career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Many organizations adopting SAFe also fail to establish clear career paths for Product Owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
*   **Dependency on External Consultants and Certifications**: SAFe's business model relies on selling training and certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>. Certifications like Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO), often obtained through short two-day classes, do not guarantee competence in actual product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>. Consulting firms like McKinsey have also played a role in pushing SAFe, despite their personnel potentially lacking direct experience in organizational transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.
*   **Lack of Leadership Guidance**: SAFe doesn't adequately define the roles of product leaders (Directors, VPs of Product) beyond the team level, leaving them uncertain about their strategic responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
*   **Misconception of "Agile"**: Many organizations equate [[agile_methodologies_and_their_historical_context | Agile]] solely with Scrum, overlooking other methodologies and the core principles of moving quickly and delivering value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>.

## Better Approaches for Digital Transformation

Instead of adopting rigid frameworks like SAFe, Melissa Perry advises organizations to focus on building a comprehensive product operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>:
*   **Product Strategy**: Establish a clear product strategy that ties back to company goals and value delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.
*   **Organizational Design**: Structure the organization around products with good coverage and skilled product managers at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.
*   **Product Operations**: Build the necessary infrastructure to support teams, enabling access to data for decision-making and facilitating direct interaction with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
*   **Culture and Incentives**: Shift away from rewarding only output (shipping many features) towards rewarding valuable outcomes that align with business objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Implement processes and tools for transparency to track what thousands of teams are doing and how it contributes to business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
*   **Strategic Leadership**: Leaders, especially in the C-suite, must actively engage with and drive software and digital strategies, recognizing them as integral to overall company strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. They should also bring in experienced product leaders who can mentor and upskill existing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>.
*   **Career Paths**: Create clear career paths for product professionals that allow growth from individual contributors to managing product lines, ensuring that Product Owners can become Product Managers with strategic capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.
*   **Adaptability**: Continuously inspect and adapt processes based on what serves the company, culture, and customer best, rather than strictly following a predefined framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.

### Advice for Product Owners
For Product Owners looking to transition into full Product Management roles or improve their impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>:
*   **Expand Beyond Developer Support**: Recognize that the role is more than just working with developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.
*   **Seek Customer Interaction**: Proactively seek opportunities to talk to customers and understand their needs, even if it's currently handled by a Product Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.
*   **Focus on Value and Outcomes**: When discussing work, emphasize the problem being solved, the value delivered, and the measurable impact on business goals, rather than just listing tasks or process adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
*   **Ask Strategic Questions**: Challenge the status quo by asking "What do we hope will happen when we release this?" and "What metrics are we going to change?" to encourage an outcome-focused mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.
*   **Advocate for Career Paths**: Inquire about career progression and advocate for a unified "Product Manager" title, clearly articulating skills and experience in resumes based on value delivered, not just [[agile_methodologies_and_their_historical_context | agile]] ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.
*   **Beware of Certifications**: Understand that certifications like CSPO are often for process understanding, not a substitute for practical product management experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
*   **Consider Internal or External Moves**: If an organization consistently hinders growth, consider moving to a different division or a company that fosters stronger product management practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

Many large, non-software native companies can and do successfully build great products by adapting principles from successful tech companies while recognizing their unique context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>. The key is to avoid "plug-and-play" solutions and instead focus on continuous learning, hiring experienced talent, and empowering teams to deliver value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.

Growing one's power can lead to positive outcomes such as promotions, career satisfaction, and reduced stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, teaches a highly popular course called "Paths to Power," which focuses on building these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. He emphasizes that power is a skill set, not an inherent personality trait, and can be mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

The skills associated with gaining power are often considered uncomfortable because they don't align with conventional societal teachings or personal aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:06">[03:51:06]</a>. However, not learning these skills can put individuals, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, at a further disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:06">[05:00:06]</a>. Pfeffer argues that power is a tool, and like any tool, its impact depends on how it is used; a hammer can be used for construction or harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:06">[04:27:06]</a>.

The "Paths to Power" course teaches students how to apply these principles by actively "doing power" through practical assignments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>. The learning is designed to "stick" by requiring practical application, much like learning a language or a physical skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:06">[01:48:06]</a>.

## The Seven Rules of Power

Jeffrey Pfeffer's book, "The Seven Rules of Power," outlines key principles for acquiring and wielding influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>. The rules are:
1.  Get out of your own way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
2.  Break The Rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
3.  Show up in a powerful fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
4.  Create a powerful brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
5.  Network relentlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
6.  Use your power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
7.  Understand that once you've acquired power, what you did to get there will be forgiven or forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

### 1. Get Out of Your Own Way

This principle addresses internal barriers to acquiring power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:06">[01:46:06]</a>.
*   **Overcome Discomfort:** A common barrier is the discomfort associated with the idea of power itself, which can prevent individuals from taking necessary steps for career success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.
*   **Combat Imposter Syndrome:** Many individuals suffer from imposter syndrome, feeling they don't deserve their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:06">[02:11:06]</a>. This self-doubt can manifest as "preemptory apologies" or disempowering self-descriptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:06">[02:27:06]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Competence over Likability:** While not actively trying to be disliked, one should prioritize competence and respect over being liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:06">[02:51:06]</a>. As the saying goes, "If you want to be liked, get a dog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:06">[02:51:06]</a>. Individuals are hired to get a job done and should focus on using their skills for organizational success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:06">[02:57:06]</a>.

### 2. Break The Rules

Breaking rules helps individuals stand out and become memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a>.
*   **Be a Disruptor:** Rules are often created by those who benefit from the existing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:06">[02:35:06]</a>. Disrupting established norms can create value and differentiate an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:06">[02:40:06]</a>.
*   **Ask for Help:** Conventional wisdom often discourages asking for help, but research suggests people overestimate how much they'll need to ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:06">[02:41:06]</a>. The worst outcome of asking is a "no," leaving you no worse off than if you hadn't asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:06">[02:47:06]</a>.

### 3. Show Up in a Powerful Fashion

Appearance and demeanor significantly influence how others perceive one's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:06">[03:38:06]</a>.
*   **Body Language and Sound:** People respond primarily to how others look, secondarily to how they sound, and least to the content of what they say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:06">[04:44:06]</a>.
*   **Actionable Tips:** This includes avoiding reading from notes, making eye contact, keeping statements brief, using more gestures, maintaining open body posture, and speaking with a louder voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:06">[04:02:06]</a>. Even anger can signal power if it's outside the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:06">[04:09:06]</a>.
*   **Mastery is Key:** These are skills that can be learned and practiced, similar to acting or public speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:06">[04:45:06]</a>. Practice and coaching are essential for [[transformative_nature_of_improving_public_speaking_skills | developing impactful speeches]] and [[techniques_for_developing_impactful_speeches | public speaking skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:06">[05:59:06]</a>.

### 4. Create a Powerful Brand

To advance in a career, it's crucial to be known and differentiate oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:06">[02:59:06]</a>.
*   **Visibility and Value:** It is not enough to be smart or skilled; one must be visible. Building a brand means doing something that causes people to know who you are and recognize the value you create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:06">[03:10:06]</a>.
*   **Strategic Self-Presentation:** This involves strategically thinking about how one dresses, looks, and presents oneself to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:06">[03:32:06]</a>. While visibility needs substance, substance without visibility goes unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:06">[04:45:06]</a>.
*   **Reframing Self-Promotion:** Self-promotion can be reframed as amplifying team impact or scaling oneself by sharing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:06">[04:02:06]</a>.

### 5. Network Relentlessly

Networking, though often seen as "cringey," is essential for gaining knowledge and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:06">[03:37:06]</a>.
*   **Generosity as a Principle:** The first principle of networking is generosity â€“ seeking to help others, make introductions, and provide useful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.
*   **Build a Broad Social Network:** The more people one knows, the more knowledge and opportunities become available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:06">[03:12:06]</a>.
*   **Pursue Weak Ties:** Strong ties (family, close friends) tend to know the same information and people. Weak ties, or connections with people different from you, provide non-redundant information and introduce you to new networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:06">[04:11:06]</a>.
*   **Become a Broker:** A broker connects people or groups who can benefit from being connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:06">[03:45:06]</a>. This role creates value and positions one centrally in a network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:06">[03:55:06]</a>.

### 6. Use Your Power

Using power leads to more power, creating a self-fulfilling cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:06">[04:11:06]</a>.
*   **Mobilize Resources:** When in a position of power or authority, mobilizing resources and achieving results leads to being given more resources and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:06">[04:07:06]</a>.
*   **Attraction to Success:** People are attracted to success; becoming successful draws more people who want to work with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:06">[04:14:06]</a>.
*   **Appearance of Power:** Simply showing that you have power can create more power, as others tend to follow the lead of those perceived as powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:06">[04:38:06]</a>.

### 7. Success Excuses (Almost) Everything

People tend to forgive or forget the methods used to acquire power once that power is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Life is Self-Fulfilling:** Life is not homeostatic; if one is believed to be powerful, they tend to become more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.
*   **Desire for Association:** People want to be associated with money, power, and success, and they will often overlook flaws to be close to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>.

## Applying the Principles

The "Paths to Power" course uses [[practical_exercises_for_selfdiscovery_and_accountability | practical exercises for self-discovery and accountability]] to help students implement these ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:06">[05:31:06]</a>. These include:
*   **Goal Setting:** Identifying what success looks like by the end of the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:06">[05:51:06]</a>.
*   **Self-Assessment and Development Plan:** Rating oneself on attributes of power and creating a plan to build strengths and address weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:06">[05:56:06]</a>.
*   **Creating Resources:** Identifying ways to create resources that provide leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:06">[05:46:06]</a>.
*   **Personal Branding Statement:** Defining how one wants to be known and seeking feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:06">[05:12:06]</a>.

It's important to start with small, uncomfortable steps and gradually push beyond one's comfort zone, rather than attempting drastic changes immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:06">[05:43:06]</a>. This gradual approach, often referred to as the 15% rule, ensures sustained progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:06">[05:50:06]</a>.

## The Price of Power

While pursuing power offers significant benefits, it also comes with downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. Jeffrey Pfeffer chose autonomy over ultimate power, preferring control over his time and schedule rather than the demands of a high-power position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. High-power roles often come with:
*   **Loss of Autonomy:** Schedules are controlled by others, and there's little control over personal time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.
*   **Intense Scrutiny:** Increased visibility leads to every aspect of one's life being scrutinized in public and private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>.
*   **Trust Dilemma:** It becomes difficult to discern if people associate with you because of who you are or because of the position you hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.
*   **Personal Cost:** The relentless pursuit of power can impact family, leading to high rates of divorce and personal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

Despite these challenges, acquiring power, especially for "good people," is essential to bring about change in areas that are resistant to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:23">[01:08:23]</a>.

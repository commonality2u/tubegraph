Many organizations believe their primary issues stem from a lack of training for their people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, 99% of the time, the real problem lies in how they set their goals and [[executing_strategy_effectively_in_product_management | deploy their strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Without clear context on what to work towards, training becomes ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This highlights the need for a holistic approach when undertaking transformations or establishing a product organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Common Challenges in Product Organizations

Melissa Perri, a product management expert who has worked with over 4,000 Product Managers and hundreds of companies, identifies a critical issue for SaaS companies as they scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. After achieving product-market fit and preparing for rapid growth, companies transition from single-product to multi-product portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This phase necessitates a complete re-evaluation of their [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | strategy]], increased focus, and prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. It's often the first time these companies need to form and [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | deploy a comprehensive and prioritized strategy]] to a large employee base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

The biggest recurring issue for companies that understand software's critical role is prioritizing it, scaling the organization, and finding the right people to build it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Signs of a Missing or Unused Strategy

Several indicators suggest a company or team lacks a clear strategy or isn't effectively utilizing one:

*   **Overworked Teams, Stagnant Metrics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>: Teams are working excessively, constantly releasing features, but key business metrics are not improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
*   **"Black Box" Perception of Product/Tech** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>: Executives are unaware of what product and tech teams are doing or how their work contributes to company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   **Missing Middle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>: A disconnect exists between tactical team-level work (e.g., feature enhancements, bug fixes) and how it ladders up to the company's vision, objectives, and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Answers to "Why?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>: When asked what they're working on and why, different people across the organization provide varying answers, indicating a lack of alignment on the complete strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   **Vague Vision Statements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>: A vision like "being the backbone of healthcare" is a tagline, not a clear vision that outlines what the company is manifesting, what it will do, what it won't do, and how it will differ in five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.
*   **Teams Spread Too Thin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>: Without a clear strategy, teams often pursue too many initiatives, hindering progress on key business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
*   **Infighting Among Stakeholders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>: Executives have different, unaligned goals for the company, leading to conflicts between departments (e.g., sales focused only on net new logos without strategic context) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

## Achieving Strategy and Vision Alignment

When [[mission_vision_and_strategy_alignment | strategy is deployed correctly]], everyone in the organization should be able to tell the same story about what they are doing and why it contributes to the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. This deep understanding of how tactical work impacts business metrics is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. A well-aligned strategy also significantly reduces conflicts among stakeholders and executives, allowing for objective trade-off discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

### Crafting a Clear Vision

A strong [[developing_and_communicating_a_product_vision | product vision]] should be:

*   **Concrete** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>: People should be able to visualize what it will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. It cannot be vague or "fluffy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.
*   **Lofty and Future-Oriented** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>: It should be a long-term goal that requires iteration and testing to achieve, not something that can be hit by building one thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
*   **Differentiated** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>: It must clearly articulate how the company will be different from its competitors and why it will be better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
*   **Specific about Target Customers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>: Define who the future customers are and how the value provided will be different from today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   **Explicit about What NOT to Do** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>: A good vision also defines what the company won't pursue or copy from competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.

### Documenting Strategy and Vision

Melissa Perri recommends documenting strategy and vision in clear, concise memos, ideally two-pagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. These documents should cover:

*   Company origin and current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>
*   External threats and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>
*   What the company will and won't do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>
*   Prioritized "strategic intents" (big business movers for the next 2-3 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>
*   Product initiatives (problem-oriented, made of multiple epics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>
*   Solutions (what teams will build to address initiatives and strategic intents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>

These documents should be linked together, perhaps in Google Docs or a wiki, allowing anyone to trace the strategy from tactical work up to the overall company vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. Combining written explanations with visual aids like prototypes, diagrams, or sketches can make the vision more powerful and help align visually-oriented executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

### Cultivating Strategic Thinking

To get better at [[importance_of_strategy_and_decision_making_in_product_management | strategy]]:

*   **"Pretend you're the CPO"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>: Even if it's not your role, imagine what you would do in a leadership position. Analyze data, ask questions, and think about strategic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>.
*   **Talk to Leaders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>: Ask your Chief Product Officer or other leaders about their process for setting priorities and what data they review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.
*   **Engage with Other Departments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>: Speak with sales about win/loss analyses, product marketing about positioning, and other subject matter experts about market trends and innovation. These conversations provide invaluable context not always visible at the team level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>: Leaders need data from all sourcesâ€”internal systems, user analytics, financial systems, customer research, and market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. Hiring data analysts can help surface numbers and patterns for informed decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.
*   **Embrace Decision-Making and Iteration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>: It's impossible to be 100% certain a strategy will work. Make the best-informed decision possible at the time, but be willing to course-correct based on new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.

## The Role of Product Operations

As product management scales, product operations become crucial to ensure strategy is effective and sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. It addresses issues like inconsistent roadmaps, lack of career ladders, inefficient meetings, and difficulty accessing data or customer insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

Product operations typically involve three areas:
1.  **Internal Data and Insights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>: Helps surface data from various internal systems to track strategy progress and OKRs, providing inputs for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.
2.  **Customer Research and User Insights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>: Manages external data, market research, and standardizes customer research approaches to enable product managers to talk to customers efficiently without overburdening them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.
3.  **Standardized Processes and Cadences** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>: Defines common procedures for strategy check-ins, roadmap updates, and interactions with other divisions like sales and product marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. It focuses on cross-functional standardization rather than team-specific processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

## Continuous Learning for Product Managers

Product Managers should prioritize continuous learning through execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. Analyze your current job, identify areas for improvement, and then deep-dive into specific topics to fill skill gaps (e.g., user research, data analytics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.

While there are many different opinions and frameworks in product management, the core principles remain consistent: talk to users, collaborate with teams, run experiments, build iteratively, and measure success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. The most important advice for learning is to adopt what works for you and your company's culture and discard what doesn't, adapting your approach as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

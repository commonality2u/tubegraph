With many presentations now occurring remotely on platforms like Zoom, new considerations for effective communication have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. [[Nancy Duartes insights on communication and presentation design | Nancy Duarte]] and her team have adapted their coaching to address these virtual environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.

## Virtual Presence and Eye Contact

One key recommendation for remote presentations is to look directly into the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. This simulates eye contact with the audience, even though the presenter might not be looking at their faces on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. This technique, while challenging to master, helps to create a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>.

However, remote presenting presents unique challenges:
*   **Reduced Body Language** Viewers often cannot see a presenter's hands or the full space they occupy, losing traditional communicative cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>.
*   **Soft Skills Impact** Studies indicate that prolonged remote communication has led to a decline in in-person eye contact skills, as people become less accustomed to looking directly into someone's eyes face-to-face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Presence** Coaching often focuses on how to convey presence and manage dynamics, such as ensuring remote participants' voices are heard over those in the physical room during hybrid meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>. This creates an "undulating lifecycle of new communication skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.

## Content Quality Expectations

The expectation for video content production quality has significantly shifted over the past five to eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. Informal, informative videos can now be more successful than highly polished, expensively produced ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>.

For example, a highly viewed video was an uncorrected, informally shot explanation that was "super informative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>. This suggests that the core value lies in the content itself, not necessarily in intricate video editing, infographics, or flashy transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>. The audience prioritizes the message, indicating that elaborate production is not essential for effective remote communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>.

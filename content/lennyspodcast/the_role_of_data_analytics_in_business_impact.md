At DoorDash, analytics is viewed as a [[influence_of_a_datadriven_approach_on_company_growth | business impact-driving function]] rather than a pure service function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The goal is not merely to answer "why," but to provide actionable insights by answering "what do we do now that we know this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Jessica Lax, Vice President of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, emphasizes that analytics teams should find opportunities and offer a point of view on decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Structuring Data Teams for Impact

Jessica Lax advocates for a centralized organizational model for data teams, considering it superior to embedded analytics within business units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. While analytics teams in a centralized model report through a central organization, they are divided into "pods" that map perfectly with partner teams like product, engineering, operations, and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This structure allows the analytics team to share the same goals as their partner teams, aligning incentives and focusing on the most important initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. They function as business and thought partners, bringing data-driven insights to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Benefits of a Centralized Data Organization
A centralized model offers several advantages for driving [[influence_of_a_datadriven_approach_on_company_growth | business impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>:
*   **Consistent and High Talent Bar**: It ensures a consistent bar for technical and soft skills during hiring, leading to higher quality talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Growth Opportunities**: Centralized teams provide clearer growth paths and opportunities for individuals to explore different problem areas within the company, aiding in [[retention_and_growth_challenges_in_a_datadriven_business | talent retention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Consistency of Methodologies and Metrics**: Prevents different teams from having varying definitions for the same metrics (e.g., "sales"), ensuring everyone uses consistent data and improving methodologies through collective input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This also helps in scaling by identifying common problems across teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Team Culture and Brand**: Fosters a strong team culture of learning and sharing, which is vital for attracting top talent and providing internal support through peer reviews and mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Balancing Proactive and Reactive Work

It is challenging but crucial to carve out time for exploratory work and deep dives, as there are always more questions and immediate tasks than time allows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Intentionality is key, and setting goals around finding insights through self-directed work helps hold the team accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

DoorDash uses hackathons to dedicate time to explore interesting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Many valuable insights, which have driven future roadmaps, have emerged from these deep dives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

### Case Study: Uncovering Referral Fraud
During one hackathon, the analytics team investigated the consumer acquisition referral channel, which appeared to have below-average engagement and a long payback period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. By actively trying to commit referral fraud, the team uncovered significant fraudulent behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. They found that referral engagement was a bimodal distribution: one group of excellent consumers referring other good consumers, and another group engaging in fraud to get free discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. This led to recommendations for better fraud checks and caps on referrals, significantly improving the marketing channel's efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This example highlights the importance of looking beyond averages to understand distributions and optimize for efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

### Managing Requests and Priorities
To balance ad-hoc requests with strategic deep dives, it's essential to establish a culture where leadership sets clear operating models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. By aligning goals with business partners, data teams can present trade-offs when new requests come in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. The conversation should be about which tasks are most important for achieving shared goals, rather than simply saying no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Regularly re-evaluating prioritization with business partners ensures the team is working on the most impactful things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

## Hiring for [[Practical application of strategic thinking in business | Business Impact]]

Beyond technical skills, which are table stakes, Jessica Lax looks for unique characteristics in top data talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>:
*   **Curiosity**: The ability to pull on threads and proactively investigate anomalies without being told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. This can be tested by presenting cases with subtle inconsistencies and observing how candidates react or if they notice them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solving under Ambiguity**: Candidates are assessed on their ability to break down problems, handle ambiguity, and make decisions without perfect information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. Observing how they react to being told they are wrong or how they pivot with new information is a crucial signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

Jessica Lax's own non-traditional background (starting in finance, self-taught SQL and Python) influences her hiring approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. She emphasizes hiring technical experts while grounding the team in driving [[practical_application_of_strategic_thinking_in_business | business impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. This mix of diverse technical skills and a pragmatic, business-focused mindset has been a successful partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

## [[Effective Metrics and Goal Setting for Data Teams | Effective Metrics and Goal Setting]]

Picking the right metrics is vital for a complex business like DoorDash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>. Lessons learned include:
*   **Short-term Proxy for Long-term Output**: Find a short-term metric that can be measured and quickly iterated on, which drives a long-term output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. For example, "retention" is a terrible metric to goal on in the short term because it's hard to move quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>. Instead, identify inputs that drive retention and test them through experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.
*   **Simplicity over Complexity**: Avoid complex, composite metrics with arbitrary coefficients that no one truly understands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. A simpler, even if imperfect, metric that people can intuitively grasp and discuss across the company will drive better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. For example, instead of a "Merchant Health Score," focus on measurable inputs like "Merchant photo coverage" or "active hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **Common Currency for Trade-offs**: Quantify the impact of different business levers (e.g., price, delivery times, selection) in terms of a common currency, such as Gross Order Value (GOV) or volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. This allows teams to make informed trade-offs across marketing, logistics, or operations investments, understanding what return they get for a dollar spent in various areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This is particularly crucial in a multi-sided marketplace like DoorDash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
*   **Focus on Edge Cases and Fail States**: While averages are important, it's crucial to look at edge cases and "fail states" that might be rare but cause severe negative impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>. For example, "never delivered" orders at DoorDash are rare but lead to churn and are costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. Setting concrete goals to eliminate these extreme negative experiences can have a powerful impact on brand and profitability, even if they don't appear significant in overall averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.

## Culture of Extreme Ownership

DoorDash fosters a culture of "extreme ownership" over outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. This means data scientists are expected to figure out what's happening and take action, even if it means stepping outside their traditional role, like calling customers for qualitative research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. This proactive approach, where data scientists engage in activities like [[impact_in_product_management | product management]] or engineering work, is encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>. The "We Dash" program, where all employees, including data scientists, regularly perform deliveries or customer support, builds empathy and helps identify product bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.

## [[Training and utilizing AI models in business | Training and Utilizing AI Models in Business]]

Jessica Lax is excited about using AI to make the data team more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. Specifically, tools like "Ask Data AI" are being developed to empower non-technical users to edit queries or get data insights independently, reducing the burden on the analytics team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.

## Building Diverse Data Teams

A key aspect of building a strong data team is fostering a diverse environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. This means not only technical skills but also varied backgrounds, including those from operations, marketing, finance, consulting, and different company stages (startups to large scale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. This diversity of experience and expertise allows team members to teach each other and provides a broader perspective on problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.

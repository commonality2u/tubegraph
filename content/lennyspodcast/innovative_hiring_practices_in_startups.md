Startups are increasingly adopting innovative approaches to [[hiring_for_growth_roles_in_startups | hiring]] and [[hiring_philosophies_and_organizational_structure_in_tech_startups | organizational structure]], focusing on quality, broader skill sets, and unique assessment methods to build effective teams. Linear, a rapidly growing issue tracking tool, exemplifies this trend with a distinctive [[effective_team_building_and_leadership_in_startups | team building and leadership]] philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## Linear's Hiring Philosophy: Quality Over Quantity
Linear's co-founder and CEO, Karri Saarinen, believes in building "better with less people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. This core belief shapes their [[hiring_philosophies_and_organizational_structure_in_tech_startups | hiring philosophy]] and [[effective_team_building_and_leadership_in_startups | organizational structure]], prioritizing high-caliber individuals over a large workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

Since its inception in 2019, Linear has never more than doubled its employee count in a year, maintaining a slow and deliberate pace of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>. This contrasts sharply with many fast-growing startups that scale rapidly, often leading to "chaos or just messiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>.

### Seeking Broader Skill Sets and "Taste"
Linear actively seeks candidates with a broader perspective "more than their title" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. This means:
*   **Engineers with Product Sensibility:** Engineers are expected to possess "product thinking" and the ability to "articulate why some choices are better than some others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>. They should also be capable of communicating and thinking about scope, rather than solely executing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. This enables a leaner [[hiring_philosophies_and_organizational_structure_in_tech_startups | organizational structure]] with only one Head of Product for a team of around 50 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.
*   **Marketing with Storytelling:** Marketing hires should demonstrate a "taste of what's interesting" and an appreciation for writing and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>.
*   **Operations with Cross-Functional Understanding:** Operations personnel are valued if they also understand areas like HR, even if it's not their primary role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

This approach fosters a culture where employees are willing to "pick up things more easily" and work together, avoiding the "not my job" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. It also allows individuals to own larger scopes from the start, rather than waiting to advance through traditional company levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.

## The Paid Work Trial
Linear's most distinctive [[hiring_philosophies and organizational structure in tech startups | hiring practice]] is its mandatory paid work trial for all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.
*   **Structure:** After standard interview loops, candidates act as "mini contractor[s]" for a set period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>. They are given a "vague problem statement" to scope, understand, and build a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **Benefits for Candidates:** The trial allows candidates to "see what kind of company are joining" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>, gaining access to the code base, participating in meetings, and interacting with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. This transparency helps them make an informed decision about joining a startup, which can be "very risky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.
*   **Benefits for Linear:** It allows Linear to assess how candidates "operate in this kind of environment," approach problems, and "make progress in a very short time frame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.

This practice has a high success rate, with very few candidates declining the trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>.

### Assessing Product Sensibility
To gauge product sensibility, Karri Saarinen frequently asks candidates about past projects:
*   "Why was this decision made?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>
*   "Do you think it was the right decision?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>
*   "What do you think you would have done that differently?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>

This line of questioning aims to uncover if candidates have well-reasoned opinions, rather than just subjective preferences. They should be able to "expand on it saying like, 'Well, I don't like it because in this case like it would not work well for this kind of users or in this kind of context or for this kind of purposes'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>.

## Cultivating a Product-Minded Team
Linear's approach relies on the entire team, including engineers and designers, having a deep understanding of the product and its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.
*   **User Research:** The team engages in extensive user research, with founders and team members regularly talking to customers, answering questions in shared Slack channels, and discussing customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.
*   **Intuition over Metrics:** Linear rarely sets specific metrics-based goals for features, prioritizing solving customer problems and fostering a strong intuitive understanding of what is "right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.
*   **Embracing Mistakes:** The company culture embraces the idea that mistakes will happen, encouraging action based on informed intuition rather than paralysis by data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

> "The whole company kind of has to like be with the customers or like like talk to them and and then like understand like where the product might work well or where it might fall short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.

This [[cultural_practices_in_rapidly_scaling_companies | cultural practice]] allows for a highly focused approach to product development, even when it means saying "no" to opportunities that don't align with the "main quest line" of building the core product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.

By implementing these [[challenges_and_strategies_for_creating_successful_startups | strategies for creating successful startups]], Linear aims to build a highly effective and cohesive team that can develop a high-quality product, fostering trust and long-term retention with its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.

[[SEO and content marketing | Search Engine Optimization (SEO)]] is a powerful, yet often misunderstood, growth lever for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Many companies tend to under-resource [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] while over-resourcing paid advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For large companies like Zillow or eBay, spending tens of millions on ads but only fifty thousand on [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] doesn't make sense, especially when the traffic potential from [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] could be equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## When to Focus on SEO

Deciding when to invest in [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] involves assessing two primary factors: the addressable market size and existing authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.

### Addressable Market
The addressable market for [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] must be large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Most categories generally offer a large market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. To assess this, one can look at product or audience competitors using tools like Similarweb to understand their total traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>. By comparing potential [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] traffic and conversion rates with other channels like paid ads or social media, a company can determine if [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] is the right channel to focus on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

### Existing Authority and Traction
Google prefers to rank credible domains, so it's often too early for seed or Series A companies with no existing traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Key signals for authority include:
*   **Non-SEO Traffic**: A company should have at least 1,000 daily visits from non-[[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] channels (e.g., direct, paid, email, social) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>. This indicates that the site is not "just an [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] farm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>.
*   **Referring Domains**: Aim for at least 1,000 referring domains linking to the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. More links from other sites indicate greater importance to Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>.
*   **Shares and Social Activity**: These also serve as authority signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.
*   **Branded Search**: The number of times people type a brand name into Google (e.g., "Masterclass") is an authority signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

If these benchmarks aren't met, it's harder to grow with [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. However, once a company has traction, [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] can multiply that traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### Product Characteristics
Certain product characteristics can make [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] easier:
*   **User-Generated Content (UGC)**: Companies with extensive UGC, like Glassdoor or Pinterest, have a lower scope for competition, making it easier to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **SKUs/Addresses**: E-commerce sites with many SKUs or real estate sites with many addresses (like Zillow) also have an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   Even without UGC or many SKUs, companies can still compete through [[SEO and content marketing | editorial SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Types of SEO

There are three main types of [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]]:

1.  **[[AI and programmatic SEO | Programmatic SEO]]**: Involves pages automatically generated from a database of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Examples include product pages on eBay, address pages on Zillow, or UGC pages on Glassdoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This usually involves category pages (grids/lists of items) and item pages (single products, addresses, videos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. A key advantage is that there's no per-page cost for creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
2.  **[[SEO and content marketing | Editorial SEO]]**: Relates to content manually written by a person, such as articles, guides, or listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This type of [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] is increasingly driving more traffic than [[AI and programmatic SEO | programmatic SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Examples of companies excelling in [[SEO and content marketing | editorial SEO]] include MasterClass, BetterUp, NerdWallet, HubSpot, and Dotdash (e.g., Investopedia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Every page has a cost associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
3.  **[[Tools and techniques for effective SEO | Technical SEO]]**: Refers to the underlying infrastructure, including internal link architecture, tags, redirects, and page speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. While important for general strategy, it's not the primary way to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

**Prioritization**: [[SEO and content marketing | Editorial SEO]] is often the most effective, but the best choice depends on the specific category and the page types that map to desired search queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. For Zillow or eBay, programmatic pages are usually more suitable, but [[SEO and content marketing | editorial SEO]] is an opportunity for almost any company with an addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## How to Win at SEO: The Workflow

A high-impact [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] strategy follows a clear workflow:

1.  **Define the Addressable Market**: Identify the topics and keywords to target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
2.  **Determine Page Type**: Based on the keywords, identify the appropriate page type (e.g., article, address page, category page) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This is done by searching for target keywords in Google and observing the themes and patterns of the ranking page types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
    *   For example, searching "how to poach an egg" shows articles with recipes, not chapter transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
    *   There might be one or two dominant page types for a set of queries, like a category page and a listicle page for "best cameras" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
3.  **Define Product Requirements**: Specify what components are needed on the page (e.g., map, phone number for an address page) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This is also derived by observing common elements on high-ranking pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. The goal is not just to copy, but to take inspiration and create a genuinely useful page that fulfills user intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
4.  **Content Strategy**: Define the subtopics and themes that need to be covered comprehensively on each page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
5.  **Infrastructure**: Ensure Google can find all pages via links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Key Concepts

### Topics vs. Keywords
The landscape of [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] has shifted from being keyword-based (one page per keyword) to topic-based (many keywords per page) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Google's algorithm has improved its semantic understanding and now targets topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   A single page can rank for 200 to 2,000 different keywords within a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   The actual search volume for a topic (e.g., "best cameras") can be 10x or more than the search volume of a single keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   Thinking in topics avoids wasted resources on redundant articles for similar keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   A page needs to fulfill the intent of *all* relevant keywords within its topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

To identify topics:
*   Look for keywords where the same results consistently appear in Google searches; these form a "cluster" or topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   The topic name is usually the highest search volume keyword within that cluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   To determine if sub-topics should be on the same page or separate pages, compare the search results for closely related terms (e.g., "five-year plan template" vs. "five-year plan examples"). If results are completely different, separate pages are likely needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### Topical Authority
[[Topical Authority | Topical authority]] is a critical, often misunderstood, aspect of [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. It's not just about overall domain authority but about what a site is known for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.
*   **Inputs**: [[Topical Authority | Topical authority]] is influenced by diverse inputs beyond just links, including non-[[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] traffic, social shares, and branded search queries (e.g., "MasterClass Gordon Ramsay") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.
*   **Semantic Relation**: Google identifies sites that are disproportionately authoritative for specific themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. For example, a viral blog post about "jello shots" can boost a site's ranking for semantically related topics like "vodka recipes," even if those pages aren't directly linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.
*   Newer companies can outrank competitors with higher overall domain authority by focusing on specific, niche topics where they can build strong [[Topical Authority | topical authority]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.

### Engagement
User engagement is a key [[SEO and content marketing | ranking signal]]:
*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: How often users click on a site's listing in search results compared to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Time on Page/Bounce Rate**: How long users stay on a page and whether they return to Google to find another answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Google tracks this through Chrome and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. High engagement means Google is fulfilling user intent, leading to higher rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

### Internal Linking
Internal linking is an underappreciated lever for [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Studies have shown that pages with more internal links receive significantly more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Fixing internal link spread can lead to 25% or even 100%+ traffic increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **How it Works**: Google crawls sites through links. If pages lack sufficient internal links (ideally at least 10), Google struggles to find and crawl them regularly, limiting their potential ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Common Problems**: Many sites exhibit a "power curve" in internal linking, where a small percentage of pages receive the vast majority of links, leaving many pages with zero or very few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Common linking algorithms (facet-based, related, popular, recent) often fail to spread links evenly across the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Solution**: Aim for a flat link graph, where pages are as few "hops" as possible from key crawl points (e.g., homepage, popular landing pages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Crucially, body links (links within the main content) carry more weight than navigational or footer links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Tools and Techniques for Effective SEO

Several [[tools_and_techniques_for_effective_seo | tools and techniques]] are essential for an effective [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] strategy:

*   **Google Search Console**: A free tool offering real traffic data and SERP tracking for every keyword a site ranks for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Clearscope**: A top tool for content analysis and scoring, helping identify gaps in content coverage related to subtopics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Ahrefs or Semrush**: Keyword research tools (paid, ~$100-200/month) used to get competitor data, top pages, keywords, and search volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Screaming Frog**: A niche application for crawling sites to audit for errors, redirects, and analyze internal link coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Tools**: Companies may build custom tools for specific needs like topic clustering, subtopic identification, or [[Topical Authority | topical authority]] assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Testing**: A/B or sequential tests are used to validate hypotheses, typically after initial launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Some domain-wide changes (like Google Panda) or complex internal link architecture cannot be easily split-tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Timelines and Expectations

[[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] is a long-term investment.
*   **Typical Timeline**: Expect results in about six to nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. This includes approximately three months to build page types, analyze data, develop strategy, and launch, followed by three to six months for pages to start ranking and growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Factors**: The more existing authority and traction a site has, the faster it will see results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. For large, authoritative sites like Netflix, changes can be seen the next day; for brand new sites, it might take a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Early Signals**: Look for leading indicators like a page ranking at least number 20 for any keyword, even with few clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. As engagement improves, Google will test the page on more competitive keywords, leading to exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. It's common to incorrectly conclude failure due to initial misimplementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

## [[Hiring strategies for SEO roles | Hiring Strategies for SEO Roles]]

[[Hiring strategies for SEO roles | Hiring for SEO]] depends on the specific strategy, company stage, opportunity, and budget:

*   **Programmatic SEO**: Requires a more specialized profile, typically a growth person with strong technical ability and prior experience in building scalable systems and handling nuances like indexation logic and keyword clustering at the category level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. It's beneficial to seek out individuals from companies that have achieved high [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] growth without being well-known brands, as they often have more diverse experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Their day-to-day involves analyzing competitors, defining product requirements for automated pages, clustering keywords, and working with engineers to implement and analyze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Editorial SEO**: While not easy, it's less specialized. A young, hungry person or someone with content/editorial strategy experience who can learn [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] workflows can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. The core role is an [[Hiring strategies for SEO roles | SEO]] manager who identifies prioritized topics, creates comprehensive outlines, and oversees publishing, working with domain experts for writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Team Size**: Initially, a minimum team would be one [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] person (for strategy and outlines) and one writer (for content creation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Operations often start with 10-25 articles/month, scaling to 100+ once leading indicators confirm success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

## Getting Things Done: Overcoming Blocks

A significant challenge in [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] is that recommendations often don't get launched due to resource constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Organizational Design**: [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] changes are often product changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Integrating [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] into the product organization (as in [[productled_growth_strategies | product-led SEO]]) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Executive Buy-in**: Gaining support at the executive level helps prioritize [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Demystification**: Because [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] can seem mysterious, it's often deprioritized compared to more tangible initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Clear communication about the expected impact is important.
*   **High Scope**: [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] often requires significant work and resources, especially at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## [[Impact of AI on SEO | AI and Programmatic SEO]]

The use of AI like GPT-3 for content generation in [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] is generally not recommended, with some exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
*   **Content Quality**: While [[Impact of AI on SEO | AI]] can generate grammatically correct and human-like sentences, it often lacks factual accuracy or underlying wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This is particularly problematic for sensitive topics like finance or health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
*   **Useful [[AI and programmatic SEO | AI]] Applications**: [[AI and programmatic SEO | AI]] is highly valuable for other parts of the content workflow:
    *   Extracting structure from data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
    *   Deciding which topics to write about by clustering keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
    *   Determining [[Topical Authority | topical authority]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
    *   Identifying subtopic themes and creating comprehensive content outlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
    *   A human, as a domain expert with wisdom, can then write the content based on this [[Impact of AI on SEO | AI]]-generated structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## First Steps for a Startup

To explore the opportunity of [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]], a startup should:
1.  **Assess the Addressable Market Size**: Determine if the market is large enough by examining the total traffic of product and audience competitors using tools like Similarweb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
2.  **Assess Current Authority**: Evaluate existing traction by looking at non-[[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] traffic and the number of referring domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
3.  **Prioritize Channels**: Compare the potential impact and scope of [[SEO and content marketing | SEO]] with other growth channels to decide where to allocate resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

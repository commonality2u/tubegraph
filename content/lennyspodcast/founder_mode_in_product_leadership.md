Anuka Gupta, Chief Product Officer at Rubrik and lecturer at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, shares insights on "founder mode," a concept popularized by Paul Graham. This mode describes how founders operate, influencing product development and strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Gupta views Graham's coining of the term as valuable because it named a phenomenon many had observed, sparking important discussions for founders and their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Working with a Founder in Founder Mode

When a founder effectively operates in founder mode, they are deeply understanding the business and strategically using their power to either refine existing aspects or fundamentally innovate in new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. As a [[role_of_product_leaders | product leader]], Gupta emphasizes recognizing this power and leveraging it to advance initiatives beneficial for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

Key strategies for product leaders working with a founder in founder mode include:
*   **Viewing the CEO as a Resource** Consider the CEO as a resource to help get initiatives and work done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This means engaging them to push initiatives that are crucial, making them an ally in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Understanding the Founder's Objective** When a founder proposes an idea that a product leader might not agree with, the first step is to objectively understand the underlying objective they are trying to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. By understanding their ultimate goal, the product leader can then propose alternative, more effective mechanisms to achieve that same goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Choosing Your Battles** A product leader must decide which battles are worth fighting. If a founder is unyielding on a "pet project," the product leader might choose to concede on that while ensuring core company priorities are still addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. The focus should be on what will truly make or break the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## Operating as a Product Leader in Founder Mode

Anuka Gupta is noted for excelling in founder mode herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Her approach as a [[role_of_product_leaders | product leader]] involves a deep dive into business details without stifling team empowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### Understanding the Business Details
It's crucial for leaders to understand the granular details of the business. This includes knowing what's working and what's not, understanding financial goals, and how decisions are made. This deep understanding allows a leader to strategically intervene where necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Not all collected information requires immediate action; it's about having the context to make informed choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

### Bringing the Team Along
To avoid making the team feel overridden, Gupta employs several tactics:
*   **Early Engagement and Questioning** Product leaders should engage early by asking team members to present their strategies, then posing questions and making suggestions. This fosters collaboration rather than outright rewriting the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **Seeding Hypotheses** Instead of directly stating flaws, a leader can share a hypothesis or external feedback (e.g., from customer advisory boards) and ask the team for their thoughts. This opens a discussion and allows the team to arrive at solutions collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
*   **Strategic Focus** Focus on areas most critical to the business: what could "kill the business" if not done right, and the biggest opportunities to pursue, regardless of execution difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. This provides clarity and rallies the team around key objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

### Tactics for Guiding Strategy
*   **Summarization** A highly effective tactic in meetings is to summarize what people are saying, and what that means for the direction. This acts as a checkpoint for agreement and is often perceived as strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. Summarization helps bring diverse voices together and move past conflict, getting to the heart of an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. This can be done verbally, on a whiteboard, or even in a Zoom chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
*   **"One Click Better"** After summarizing, consider how to make an idea "one click better." This involves taking existing ideas and incrementally improving them, especially from an outside-in perspective focused on customer problems and go-to-market strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. This approach can lead to significant breakthroughs and improved strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

## Connecting to Strategy (Being Strategic)

The feedback of "not being strategic enough" led Anuka Gupta to define what it means to be strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

Being strategic involves two core components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>:
1.  **Articulating a Compelling and Simple "Why"** Clearly explain the rationale behind company and product decisions and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
2.  **Championing Change** Being a change agent willing to pursue difficult actions that are in the long-term best interest of the product or company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

Both elements are necessary: articulating a "why" for small ideas is not strategic, nor is championing big ideas without a clear, simple "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. The goal is to champion a few big ideas that can change the company's direction and articulate their "why" compellingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

## Decision Making

Effective decision-making is central to [[the_personal_development_of_a_founder_and_leadership_lessons | product leadership]] and involves learning from the past and acting decisively.

### Being a Historian
To make better decisions, particularly when joining a new company, it's crucial to act as a "historian." This involves understanding past product launches (successful or not), the reasons behind past decisions, and the perceptions of different people in the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. By understanding the history, one can learn from past mistakes and address any "baggage" people might carry regarding similar initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

### Making *a* Decision vs. the *Right* Decision
It's common to fall into analysis paralysis, seeking more data before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. However, product leaders often operate with imprecise information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. The advice is to focus on making *a* decision, not necessarily the "right" one, because committing to a decision is when true learning occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. If a decision is approximately 70% correct, it can be iterated upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Making no decision yields no new, high-fidelity information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

### Creating a Culture of Learning
To foster a culture where people are not afraid to make decisions with incomplete information:
*   **Communicate Hypotheses** When making a decision, clearly state the underlying hypotheses and assumptions, as well as what is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. This allows for post-decision learning, identifying which hypotheses were proven or disproven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.
*   **Reward Learning over Outcome** In an organization, it's vital to reward the learning that comes from decisions, even if they turn out to be "bad" decisions. If the team consistently learns and improves from mistakes, it's acceptable if some decisions don't yield the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>. This encourages risk-taking and making necessary bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.

For example, a company might launch a valuable product without monetizing it, then learn post-launch that monetization is feasible. Or they might build capabilities for a new persona but misjudge the difficulty of selling to that persona internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. These are learning opportunities, not necessarily failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

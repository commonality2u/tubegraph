Toby Lütke, a builder himself, emphasizes that the most interesting question to ask fellow builders is: "What is your energy source?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> For Lütke, his energy source is "dissatisfaction with status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He believes that current society is the "dystopia of the Future," making it crucial to build products that drive progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Challenging the Status Quo: The "Toby Tornado"

Lütke's approach involves a deliberate choice to deviate from conventional methods: "If most people are doing it a certain way, I by default don't want to do it that way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This philosophy extends to the aesthetic of business, where "pessimism sounds extremely sophisticated, optimism always sounds dumb or at least naive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He asserts that the most powerful, unquantifiable things in business are fun and delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The "Toby tornado" describes Lütke's method of rapidly enacting change, often involving intense conversation, conflict, or "real talk" compressed into a short timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-05:08">[05:08]</a>. If he identifies something as "not good," he initiates a conversation. If his perspective is "steel-manned" and he learns something new, he updates his prior assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. If he's correct, a project might be stopped, and a new version started, with the previous team becoming "founders of the next version" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This seemingly "whiplashy" approach is appreciated by employees for its focus on what is best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

> [!info] Why the "Toby Tornado" works
> Lütke justifies this directness by stating that it's "super unfair for letting people work on something that isn't going to make it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Ignoring a problem would be an "abrogation of my CEO and founder responsibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. He believes in compressing time because careers are relatively short, and people should maximize the number of accomplishments they can be proud of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Thinking from First Principles

Lütke is described as a "true futurist," obsessed with how things **should be** in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. He contrasts this with being "data-driven," which can inherently anchor decisions to "the way users and technology are behaving today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. Any design derived primarily from past or present conditions is seen as inferior to one that "is skating to the puck of the way things could or should be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

> [!quote] First Principles in Product Development
> "You have to derive it from first principles. You have to say how would we solve this problem given every fundamental building block that we have available right now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>

This approach means that if someone proposes doing a "good version" of an existing solution, Lütke becomes "extremely suspicious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. He believes that if you want to do something world-class, you cannot do it like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

### The Shopify Example
Shopify itself is an example of [[the_role_of_struggling_moments_in_product_innovation | innovation]] derived from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. When Lütke started, existing e-commerce software was "path dependent," designed for established retailers with complex business logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. He, instead, optimized for making it easier to start new online businesses than in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. The goal was to build something so intuitive that frustrated individuals in "dead-end careers" could make progress on their own businesses during lunch breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. This approach proved superior, even allowing Shopify to solve "Enterprise cases" later because its core was not "overfit to the sales process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.

### Key Elements of Lütke's First Principles Approach
*   **Analyze Path Dependence:** Understand the assumptions and compromises inherent in existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.
*   **Identify Overfitting:** Recognize what existing solutions are over-optimizing for that might not be necessary or optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.
*   **Be in the Details (Close to the Metal):** For Lütke, this means being deeply involved in coding and understanding the atomic building blocks of the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. This hands-on understanding allows for better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>.
*   **Avoid Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Be willing to stop projects or change direction, even if significant effort has already been invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.
*   **Rerun Foundational Assumptions:** Continuously re-evaluate core assumptions based on new information, understanding that a change in one fundamental truth (like "are people allowed to leave their house?" during COVID-19) can lead to a completely different optimal path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. This led to Shopify's decision to go permanently remote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

## The Power of Unquantifiable Metrics: Fun, Delight, and Passion

Shopify, while data-informed, does not operate with strict KPIs or OKRs in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. This is because "good heart's law is real: the moment a metric becomes a goal it's no longer a useful metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Businesses are complex, with "a million different tensions," making it impossible to harmonize them by optimizing for one thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

Lütke emphasizes that Shopify is comfortable with "unquantifiable things such as taste, quality, passion, love, hate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. He believes that the overlap between the most valuable product features and those that are fully quantifiable is perhaps only 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. This leaves 80% of value space unaddressed by those who focus only on quantifiable metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

> [!quote] The Most Powerful Unquantifiable Things
> "The most powerful, unquantifiable things in the world of business are fun and delight." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>
> If people are having fun, even if metrics are temporarily down, "all metrics will start going up" with some time delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

This commitment to the unquantifiable requires making "certain edits to a business that don't remind everyone too much of...companies they might have come from which...the only way to get promoted is by driving a metric up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

## Maximizing Human Potential

Lütke "really, really, really" believes that "not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. He sees his role as constantly reminding people of their own potential, as he himself feels he has "way more potential than what I bring to bear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

> [!quote] The Product of Lütke's Career
> "I want my product to cause people to be more successful than they thought they could and in fact become more ambitious about what they are building with their online stores... than they actually initially set out to do." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>

This philosophy extends to direct feedback, which can be "hard to hear" but "extremely valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. He expects better from brilliant people, and by holding them to a high standard, they often accomplish things they "didn't imagine they could" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This environment of mutual accountability to "actual potential" rather than current level is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

Lütke argues that traditional education systems often "overfit" for marks, discouraging curiosity and exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. His approach with his own children, and generally in business, is to focus on "maintaining curiosity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, recognizing that "there is no speed limit for personal growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a>.

## Long-Term Vision and Positive-Sum Games

Shopify operates with a "100-year vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. This long-term perspective allows them to focus not on specific software projects, but on the enduring mission itself: making entrepreneurship more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. This perspective also influences decisions, prioritizing long-term value over short-term gains.

> [!quote] The Ultimate Growth Hack
> "On a long enough timeline, playing positive-sum games with your customers is the ultimate growth hack." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>

Lütke views company building like a "chess" game, but with "imperfect information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. There are two key aspects:
1.  **Positional Game:** Developing pieces, gaining influence, building territory, and gaining trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>. This is about long-term strategy and building fundamental value.
2.  **Tactics:** Short-term optimizations like A/B testing button colors for conversion rate increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.

The business world often overemphasizes tactics and "lionize the easy hack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>. While good enough tactics are necessary to "not go out of business," the "sum total of all the value...stays with you if you're actually doing the positional game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>. Over-focusing on tactics can lead to "extracting through the tactics the entirety of the value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>, leaving companies with "nothing left in the tank" and causing them to fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. His approach prioritizes the positional game, seeking to add as many "levers" for monetization as possible without necessarily pulling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>, thereby staying on the customer's side of the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.

## The Importance of Courage and Disagreement

Lütke actively invites disagreement, finding that it requires courage and builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. He has found that "courage is really, really rare" in the industry, more so than high IQ or genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. When someone disagrees, he immediately stops to "figure out why there's disagreement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>, often discovering an "unstated foundational assumption" he holds that is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.

He will even play "devil's advocate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>, setting himself up as an "end boss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a> to provoke deeper arguments for decisions, which ultimately builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>. This aligns with his belief in [[developing_leadership_skills_and_understanding_feedback | transparency]] and [[importance_of_trust_and_vulnerability_in_leadership | trust]] in leadership.

Lütke acknowledges that he does not "conform to the sort of traditional view of what CEOs of public companies should be like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. He attributes his success to ignoring conventional wisdom and doing what he has learned is truly effective: "be in as many details as you can...really, really, really just understand the stuff that we are making decisions about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>.

## Product Leadership and Care

Lütke states that "every product in the world, the quality at the end of the day is simply a reflection of how much the people who created it gave a shit about product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:13">[01:37:13]</a>. It is impossible to make great products if the people working on them do not care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:26">[01:37:26]</a>.

The product leader's crucial role is to "make sure that the team gives a shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>. This can be achieved through building empathy for users and by the product leader being "exothermically infectious" with their own care and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. This infectious enthusiasm alone can make a product "10 times better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:15]</a>.

> 1.  Ensure the team "looks around corners that they don't see" by understanding the product better than anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>.

This "founder mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>—pumping heat into systems and protecting those who do—allows companies to remain innovative longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

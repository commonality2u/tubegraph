Successful product development and organizational growth heavily rely on deeply embedded trust and seamless collaboration within teams. This involves not only formal processes but also fostering a culture where every member feels aligned and empowered.

## Trust as a Foundation for Leadership and Change

At the core of effective team dynamics is trust. Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe, highlights her personal learning experience at Airbnb where, early in her tenure, she realized she had not earned the trust of her design team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Despite being hired to improve collaboration and engagement within the 10-person product design team, she was met with an intervention from half the team and HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Her key takeaway was that to inflict change *with* people, rather than *on* them, [[the_role_of_trust_in_successful_experimentation | trust is the key element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. By immediately shifting to a listening-first approach, understanding individual motivations, and bringing the team along with her vision, the design team achieved the best engagement scores in the company within a couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This experience taught her to "come in listening" rather than "swinging" when joining new organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This directly relates to [[trust_building_and_impact_focus_in_product_management | trust building and impact focus in product management]].

## Cultivating Cross-Functional Collaboration

High-functioning organizations benefit significantly from [[crossfunctional_collaboration_in_data_teams | multi-disciplinary teams]] working closely together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This includes engineers, product managers, and designers having shared goals and aligning on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

Katie Dill emphasizes that sitting together and being able to "look over each other's shoulder and talk about things is important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This direct, constant interaction fosters:
*   **Checks and Balances**: Different perspectives (e.g., a designer focusing on emotional experience vs. a product manager on button clicks) lead to more holistic solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Alignment on Goals**: Aligning on the shared objective of building something "great" allows teams to integrate utility, usability, and desirability into the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   **Faster Iteration Cycles**: Rapid idea exchange between design and engineering, particularly on web presence teams, leads to quicker development while maintaining high standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>.

### Overcoming Silos: The Lyft Example
At Lyft, Katie encountered a design team physically separated from engineering and product by a locked door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>. While this fostered a safe creative space for designers, it led to:
*   Wasted work and misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.
*   Slower processes due to a lack of constant communication and shared decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>.

To address this, the physical and organizational structure was changed to bring design, engineering, and product together. Designers were embedded within product teams (e.g., driver team, rider team, safety team) and physically sat with their respective engineers and product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. While dedicated "creative spaces" for design-specific activities (like critiques) were maintained, this increased alignment and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>.

## Operationalizing Quality through Shared Understanding

Quality is a group effort, not the sole responsibility of one individual or department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Katie outlines several themes for building quality:
1.  **Group Effort**: Avoid the trap of thinking one talented hire or a QA team can carry the burden of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. Internal standards and communication will reflect externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.
2.  **Vision and Alignment**: Without a shared vision, even highly skilled individuals may produce disparate components that don't cohere into a unified, high-quality product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. Similar to building a house, a clear plan and coordination are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. This contributes to [[creating_alignment_and_buyin_within_teams | creating alignment and buy-in within teams]].
3.  **Editing and Courage**: An "editor" role (like an architect or chief editor) helps ensure all pieces fit together, requiring the courage to say "almost but no" even when significant effort has been invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
4.  **User Perspective**: Truly understanding quality requires experiencing the product from the user's perspective, especially across their entire journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

### "Walking the Store" Program at Stripe
To combat quality regression over time and the compartmentalization of teams, Stripe implemented a "Walk the Store" program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. This initiative aims to increase awareness and accountability among leaders for owning user journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

*   **Process**:
    *   15 critical user journeys are identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
    *   Each journey has dedicated engineering, product, and design leaders responsible for its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.
    *   These leaders regularly "walk the store" by experiencing the product as a user would, from initial search to dashboard interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
    *   They log frictions, file bugs, and reach out to relevant teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.
    *   Journeys are scored quarterly using a qualitative rubric (color-based system) focusing on usability, utility, and desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.
    *   Product Quality Reviews (PQR) are held regularly for calibration among leaders (including Katie Dill, David Singleton, Will Gabri) to align on quality standards across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.

*   **Benefits**:
    *   Increases empathy for users by allowing leaders to feel the pain firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>.
    *   Reveals "entailments" or broader product issues that might not be obvious from isolated features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.
    *   Leads to better internal alignment (e.g., SEO aligning with product articulation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.
    *   Converts initial skeptics from different functions into advocates for quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

## Leadership Philosophy: Performance = Potential - Interference

Katie Dill's approach to leading and scaling design teams is guided by the formula: **Performance = Potential - Interference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.
*   **Increasing Potential**: Focus on hiring well, developing talent, and fostering growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>. This connects to [[hiring_and_team_management_philosophy_in_tech_startups | hiring and team management philosophy]].
*   **Decreasing Interference**: Identify and remove obstacles that hold talented individuals back, preventing burnout and increasing enjoyment and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

### Fostering Internal Awareness
To reduce interference and improve clarity, Katie implements a system where designers share screenshots or prototypes of their work in a shared Google Slide deck every couple of weeks (now monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. This deck is circulated to product managers, engineering leaders, and company leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>.

*   **Benefits**:
    *   Allows designers to see what others are working on, preventing redundant efforts and fostering pattern recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.
    *   Provides an easy way for other functions and leaders to understand what's being built and how different product pieces fit together as a journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>.
    *   Encourages earlier identification of misalignments or potential collisions between projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.
    *   Opens up the "curtain" on work-in-progress, which, though initially challenging, ultimately makes the work better and saves time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

## Cultural Emphasis on Meticulous Craft and Intentionality

Stripe's operating principles include "meticulous Craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>. This means valuing precision and care in all work, from designing physical spaces to building APIs or handling support calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>. This cultural emphasis ensures that quality is not just a departmental goal but an expectation for everyone, influencing performance evaluations and driving a shared commitment to excellence. This aligns with [[understanding_company_cultures_impact_on_product_development | understanding company culture's impact on product development]].

At its core, design is intentionality – thinking about who is impacted and who is using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. This intentionality, when applied by everyone in a team, leads to better internal and external outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>.

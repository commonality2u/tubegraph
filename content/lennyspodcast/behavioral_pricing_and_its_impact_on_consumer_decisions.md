[[psychology_in_marketing_and_decision_making | Behavioral pricing]] involves leveraging the irrational aspects of human decision-making, rather than solely relying on rational economic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>. This approach acknowledges that individuals often make decisions based on psychological factors that can be influenced by how products and prices are presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.

Madhavan Ramanujam, author of *Monetizing Innovation*, highlights that understanding this irrational side of the brain is crucial for product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. By considering [[psychology_in_marketing_and_decision_making | behavioral pricing]] tactics, companies can build and frame their products to appeal to both rational and irrational thought processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>.

## Key Behavioral Pricing Strategies

### The Decoy Effect
The decoy effect involves introducing a third option (the "decoy") to influence the choice between two other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>.

*   **Software Product Example**: A company had three products priced at $49, $79, and $149 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>. The $49 product offered too many features, leading 60-70% of customers to choose it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>. By understanding that pricing was inelastic between $79 and $99, they moved the $79 product to $99 and the $149 product to $199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. They then introduced a new $299 product purely as a decoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>. This made the $99 product appear significantly more attractive, shifting customer mix and leading to over 30% increase in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and average revenue per user (ARPU) with no product changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>.
*   **Popcorn Example**: At a movie theater, a small popcorn might be $7, while an extra-large with butter is $8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. The $7 small popcorn acts as a decoy; without it, customers might question paying $8 for popcorn at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>.

The decoy effect leverages the "compromise effect," where people tend to avoid extremes, leading them to choose a middle-ground option that looks more appealing when a more expensive alternative is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>.

### Psychological Thresholds
These are price points where demand curves show sudden drops if crossed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>.

*   **Identifying Thresholds**: Asking customers what they consider an "acceptable price," an "expensive price," and a "prohibitively expensive price" can reveal these thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>. For example, crossing from $99 to $101 might cause a significant portion of customers to perceive it as too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>.
*   **Common Thresholds**: In B2B SaaS and consumer products, common thresholds include around $29 (equated to a dollar a day) and $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. However, specific product categories and competitive alternatives require testing to identify precise thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>.

### Framing the Price
How a price is presented can significantly alter its perception.

*   **Pennies A Day Effect**: Presenting a $30/month price as "$1 a day" can make it seem more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>. AWS utilizes this by showing very low unit prices, even though total bills can accumulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>.
*   **Annual Subscription as Monthly Price**: Even when selling an annual subscription, framing the price as a monthly equivalent (e.g., "$29.99/month, billed annually" instead of "$360/year") makes it appear more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a>.

### Razor/Razor Blade Model
This model involves offering a base product at a low or attractive price to encourage purchase, with ongoing profits derived from high-margin consumables or add-ons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:34">[01:23:34]</a>.

*   **Classic Examples**: Razor blades (razor is cheap, blades are expensive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a> and HP printer cartridges (printer is cheaper, cartridges add up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:52">[01:23:52]</a>.
*   **SaaS Application**: A SaaS product might offer a base platform at an attractive price, with additional features, usage, or integrations acting as high-margin "consumables" that customers pay for over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:58">[01:23:58]</a>. This approach appeals to customers due to lower upfront scrutiny compared to a full Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>.

### The Panini Effect
Derived from the compulsion people have to complete puzzles or collections (like Panini sticker albums), this effect can be used to drive engagement and encourage additional purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>.

*   **Application**: If a company offers multiple products, presenting them as a "puzzle" or a set where certain "pieces" are missing can create a compulsion for customers to acquire the incomplete parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>. For example, in financial services, showing six available products where a customer has only acquired some can lead to a 40-50% increase in attachment rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.
*   **Gamification**: This is similar to LinkedIn's profile completion percentage or Starbucks' bingo card promotions, which motivate users to perform actions to achieve a sense of completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:09">[01:26:09]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[psychology_in_marketing_and_decision_making | Behavioral pricing]] strategies are not about deceiving customers, but about framing products and conversations in a way that appeals to both rational and irrational decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>. By understanding these psychological levers, companies can optimize their [[the_concept_of_willingness_to_pay_and_its_importance_in_pricing_strategy | pricing strategy]], improve sales, and increase customer value without necessarily changing the underlying product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

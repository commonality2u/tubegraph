Vickr Daemon, Head of Product at Gojek, is recognized as a leading product mind in Asia, frequently cited as a favorite [[product_management_competencies | product leader]] in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He oversees product management, design, program management, research, and insights teams across India, Singapore, and Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Through his experience, Daemon has developed a [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth framework]] for [[product_management_competencies | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This framework, known as the "Three W's," focuses on what individuals produce, what they bring to the table, and their operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Successful [[product_management_competencies | product managers]] who experience rapid [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth]] typically excel in at least two or all three of these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## The Three W's Framework

### 1. What You Produce
This aspect focuses on outputs, especially early in a [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | product management career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Instead of immediately obsessing over impact or strategy, Daemon advises focusing on getting things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

*   **Outputs**: Tangibly defined tasks that can be quickly executed, such as launching a product, analyzing experiments, or contributing to a go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Examples include sourcing content, preparing briefs for summits, creating slides for leadership reviews, or compiling legal reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. The goal is to be useful and make your team more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   **Outcomes**: As one becomes comfortable with outputs and working with stakeholders, the focus shifts to controlling which outputs are necessary to achieve specific product area goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Leadership/Direction**: This stage involves figuring out which outcomes are necessary, moving towards broader leadership and strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

It is crucial to continue honing the craft of outputs even when transitioning to outcomes or senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Senior [[product_management_competencies | product managers]] should not forget their individual contributor (IC) roots and be willing to "pull up their sleeves" and work on foundational tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### 2. What You Bring to the Table
This refers to a [[product_management_competencies | product manager's]] "impact on impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. It's not enough for a product area to be successful; the [[product_management_competencies | product manager]] must demonstrably contribute to that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This means producing high-quality artifacts and excelling in core [[key_skills_for_product_managers | product management skills]]:

*   **Quality of Artifacts**: This includes well-written PRDs (Product Requirement Documents), clear product notes for care and marketing teams, and well-structured product strategy documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Jira storyboards should be detailed, not just titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
*   **Core Pillars**: [[Product_management_competencies | Product managers]] are constantly evaluated on four pillars:
    *   Data and Metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>
    *   Design and Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>
    *   Technology Skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>
    *   Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>

Instead of bringing arguments or pushbacks, strong [[product_management_competencies | product managers]] channelize questions and inputs into strategic choices that shape discussions and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

### 3. What's Your Operating Model
This is considered the most critical aspect, especially for [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | career growth]] from mid-senior to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. It focuses on communication, collaboration, organizational skills, and community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

Three key tenets for working effectively with stakeholders:
1.  Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
2.  Bring out important topics without drawing importance to oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
3.  Be in charge of getting decisions made, not making all decisions oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

When pushing back, it's crucial to bring the conversation to a more logical space from an emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. The intent should always be to advance the product and its execution, ensuring the team is unblocked and not working on "stupid" or frequently changing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

## Common [[challenges_in_product_management | Pitfalls]] and Mindset Shifts
Daemon identifies three mindset shifts that can hinder [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | growth]] if not managed:

### 1. Focusing on What You Control
Early in a career, [[product_management_competencies | product managers]] typically focus on things within their control (feedback, personal learning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. However, as they become mid-senior, conversations can shift to external factors like organizational issues, stakeholder behavior, or project assignments outside their control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. It's vital to maintain focus on what can be controlled, such as improving skills in data, technology, communication, or collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

### 2. Relationship with Change
Initially, the rate of personal skill change and growth is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. At mid-senior levels, [[product_management_competencies | product managers]] might become hesitant to take on new challenges or roles, slowing down their rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. To counter this, continuously benchmark oneself against the best in the industry or other functions to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.

### 3. How You See Yourself
Self-perception can limit [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. Telling oneself stories like "I am a very high-agency PM" or "I am a hyper-collaborative PM" can inadvertently excuse negative behaviors (e.g., being brash, indecisive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. It's critical to identify and correct these self-narratives, possibly by talking to trusted individuals, to get back on a [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | growth path]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Viewing oneself as a "learner" is an enabling story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

## [[Key Skills for Product Managers | Core Product Management Competencies]]
Daemon outlines specific [[product_management_competencies | skills]] that [[product_management_competencies | product managers]] must cultivate, moving from foundational understanding to deep expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>:

*   **Data and Metrics**: From defining basic product metrics to performing "ninja-level" data analysis like a data startup founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   **Design and Research**: From identifying user problems to tying them directly to business goals holistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
*   **Technology**: From basic understanding of concepts like HTTP/API to deep debates and writing technology design documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: From relying on others for direction to articulating a coherent product strategy at a broad level, defining how to achieve stated business goals (e.g., user segments, needs, product solutions, execution order) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.
*   **Communication & Collaboration**: Skills that are continuously developed throughout one's career, adapting to new contexts and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Organizational Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>
*   **Community Skills**: A [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] acts as a "community enabler" within the team and organization, fostering cohesion towards a common mission, especially in remote or distributed teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

When seeking to improve, it's recommended to focus on one or two areas that offer maximum leverage rather than trying to improve everything simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. For individuals transitioning into [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product management]], it's beneficial to pick a skill from a different background (e.g., if from design, pick data or tech) to gain maximum leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

## The [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | Role of the Product Manager]]
The definition of [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product management]] remains ambiguous across the industry and even within large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. Daemon's general answer to "is a [[the_role_of_a_product_manager | product manager]] expected to do this?" is: if something is blocking product progress, then yes, they should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.

[[the_role_of_a_product_manager | Product management]] has both an art and a science, and the science can be used to understand the art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. [[product_management_competencies | Product managers]] are unique in their role as co-collaborators for all disciplines (strategy, technology, design, data), tying everything together and possessing unique insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. Their job is to elevate the team's overall contribution, energy, and output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. It's about playing a **role**, not just adhering to a title or function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

## Contrarian Views

Daemon holds two views that may be considered contrarian:
1.  **Intent is Not Enough**: While good intent is important, it is not sufficient. Actions, behavior, and the way one communicates and collaborates must also convey who they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.
2.  **Effort and Hours are Essential**: Putting in effort and hours is necessary for [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | growth]] and skill improvement. This has become "politically incorrect" to state, but it is a fundamental truth for personal and professional development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.

His insights provide valuable [[tips for new and senior product managers | tips for new and senior product managers]] for career growth and [[improving product management skills | improving product management skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Vr's Career Growth Framework for Product Managers: The Three W's

Vr developed a [[frameworks for growth in product management | career growth framework]] for [[role of product managers | product managers]] based on "three W's" that differentiate high-performing individuals who experience rapid career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>:
1.  What you produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
2.  What you bring to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
3.  What's your operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>

The most successful [[role of product managers | product managers]] excel in at least two, and often all three, of these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### 1. What You Produce (Outputs)

Focusing on "outputs" is crucial, especially early in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Outputs are tangibly defined actions that don't require extensive strategy or visualization, allowing for quick execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Examples of outputs include:
*   Launching a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
*   Analyzing and running experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
*   Contributing to a go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
*   Producing first drafts of briefs, slides for leadership reviews, or legal reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>

It's essential to focus on getting things "out and done" rather than solely obsessing over impact, especially when starting out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. As a [[role of product managers | product manager]], the job is to "be useful" by making the team more effective and helping the company succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Even senior [[role of product managers | product managers]] should not forget their individual contributor (IC) roots and be willing to "pull up their sleeves" to work on outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### 2. What You Bring to the Table (Impact on Impact)

This aspect focuses on a [[role of product managers | product manager's]] impact on the product's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. It's not enough for a product area to be successful; the [[role of product managers | product manager]] must demonstrate their useful contribution to that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

This is often demonstrated through the quality of product artifacts:
*   **PRD Quality:** Are product requirements documents (PRDs) well-written and clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>?
*   **Product Notes:** Are product notes well-crafted and useful for other teams like care or marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>?
*   **Deriving from Strategy:** Are you effectively translating strategy into actionable plans, rather than constantly pushing back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>?
*   **Working with Metrics:** How well do you work with North Stars, experiments, data, and metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>?

[[Role of product managers | Product managers]] are evaluated on four pillars: data and metrics, design and research, technology [[skills for modern product managers | skills]], and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. The best way to demonstrate proficiency in these areas is through high-quality artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Strong [[improving product management skills | product managers]] channelize questions and inputs into strategic choices that shape discussions and direction, rather than just bringing arguments and pushbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

### 3. What's Your Operating Model

This is considered the most important aspect for transitioning from mid-senior to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. It encompasses communication, collaboration, organizational skills, and community skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

Three tenets for effective operating models as a [[role of product managers | product manager]]:
1.  **Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> This involves bringing conversations to a logical space from an emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
2.  **Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>
3.  **Be able to get decisions made without having to make all the decisions yourself.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>

## Impediments to Product Management Career Growth

Vr identifies three mindset shifts that can hinder a [[role of product managers | product manager's]] career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. These represent [[challenges and opportunities of being a product manager | challenges and opportunities of being a product manager]].

### 1. Focusing on What You Control

Early in a career, individuals are often focused on what they can control, such as their craft, output, and personal performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. However, as [[role of product managers | product managers]] become mid-senior, conversations can shift to things outside their control, such as organizational shortcomings or external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. It's crucial to maintain focus on what can be controlled, aligning with the "three W's" framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

### 2. Relationship with Change (Rate of Change)

When starting out, the rate of personal skill change is high, leading to rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. As [[role of product managers | product managers]] become more senior, this rate can slow down due to a reluctance to take on new challenges or a fear of career impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. To counter this, constantly benchmark yourself against the best in the industry or in other functions to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

### 3. How You See Yourself (Self-Narratives)

The stories [[role of product managers | product managers]] tell themselves about who they are (e.g., "I am a very high agency PM," "I am a very collaborative PM") can define and hinder their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. For example, a "high agency" PM might feel it's okay to be brash or cut corners, while a "hyper collaborative" PM might be indecisive <a class="yt=" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. It's vital to identify and correct these self-stories, potentially by seeking feedback from trusted individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. Cultivating a mindset of continuous learning is an "enabling story" for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

## Defining the [[role of product managers | Product Manager Role]]

The definition of [[role of product managers | product management]] remains ambiguous across the industry, leading to confusion for both [[role of product managers | product managers]] and their stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. Vr suggests that if something is blocking product progress, the [[role of product managers | product manager]] should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.

*   [[Role of product managers | Product management]] is a discipline that improves with practice, combining both "art" and "science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.
*   Instead of fixating on a definition, focus on your contribution and output across key axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.
*   A [[role of product managers | product manager]] is the "co-collaborator" for all disciplines—strategy, technology, design, and data—and ties them together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   The [[role of product managers | product manager]] serves as the "community enabler" within the team and organization, fostering cohesion towards a common mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. This is particularly important for remote or distributed teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.
*   Seeing oneself as playing a "role" rather than just having a "title" clarifies responsibilities and allows for adaptability across different teams and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

## Key [[skills for modern product managers | Skills for Modern Product Managers]]

Vr outlines critical [[skills for modern product managers | skills for modern product managers]] that contribute to [[improving product management skills | improving product management skills]] and growth, often represented in career ladders:

*   **Data and Metrics:** Ranging from defining basic metrics (level zero) to being an "absolute Ninja level data quality" expert who could start their own data company (level five, like former Gojek head of growth, [[Crystal Waja | Crystal Waja]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **Design and Research:** From identifying user problems (level zero) to tying user problems to business goals (level five) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
*   **Technology:** From no understanding of basic tech concepts (level zero) to deep debates and writing technology design documents (level five) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** While others define top-level corporate or business goals, [[role of product managers | product managers]] define "how" to climb that mountain. This involves focusing on user segments, their needs, figuring out the right product, and the order of work (level zero is relying on others, level five is articulating a coherent product strategy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.
*   **Communication & Collaboration:** These are softer [[skills for modern product managers | skills]] that require lifelong development due to constantly changing contexts and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Organizational Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>
*   **Community Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>

When trying to grow, focus on the area that offers "maximum leverage" for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. A common recommendation for those transitioning into product is to pick one skill from Data or Tech, and one from Design & Research or Strategy, to build a strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

## Contrarian Views

Vr shares two "contrarian" beliefs:

*   **Intent is not enough:** While good intent is important, it's not sufficient. Actions, behavior, communication style, and collaboration methods must also align and demonstrate who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.
*   **Effort and hours are necessary for growth:** It has become "politically incorrect" to state, but putting in consistent effort and hours is crucial for personal and professional growth, not just for company advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>.

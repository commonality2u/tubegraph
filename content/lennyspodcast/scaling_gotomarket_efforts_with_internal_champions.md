Claire Butler, Figma's tenth employee and first marketing hire, discusses how Figma grew using a unique [[bottomup_gotomarket_strategy | Bottom-up go-to-market motion]] focused on individual contributors (ICs) becoming internal champions within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. This approach allowed Figma to scale its go-to-market efforts efficiently, even operating without a sales team for the first three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">[01:15:58]</a>.

## Figma's Two-Part Go-to-Market Strategy

Figma's core [[figmas_approach_to_productled_growth_and_community_building | go-to-market strategy]] involves two main parts:
1.  Getting individual contributors (ICs) at a company to love the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>.
2.  Enabling and helping these ICs to spread the product within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

### Step 1: Getting Individual Contributors to Love the Product

This initial phase focuses on building a deep connection with users, especially in the early days when the product is unknown and users might be resistant to switching tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

#### 1. Build Credibility
Designers, Figma's initial core audience, are not receptive to traditional marketing buzzwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Instead, they wanted to hear about technical features and how the tool worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Technical Content:** Figma's engineering and design teams produced deep, technical content explaining how the tool worked and the craft decisions behind features like Vector Networks and grids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The bar for this content was high: if a marketer could write it, it was too basic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This content often topped Hacker News, generating interest from engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **[[building_and_scaling_product_leadership_programs | Designer Advocates]]**: Six months post-launch, Figma hired its first designer advocate, a passionate user who was a designer, not a marketer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This role became crucial for interacting with users, gathering feedback, creating content, and maintaining authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. This function has since scaled into a large team, including developer and FigJam advocates, and is considered "magic dust" for their go-to-market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

#### 2. Build with Your Users
Direct engagement with users is critical, especially in the early days, to foster a sense of ownership and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Hyper-responsiveness:** An early example involved Koda, Figma's first user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. When their engineer couldn't open a file due to a MacBook issue, Dylan drove an engineer down to Palo Alto to fix it immediately, ensuring the user could use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Support:** In the early days, everyone, including engineers and founders, jumped into Intercom chats to debug and fix issues live with users, fostering a deep connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This "doing things that don't scale" approach is essential for initial [[bottomup_gotomarket_strategy | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Scaling Feedback (Little Big Updates):** At scale, Figma instituted "Quality Weeks" where engineers fixed small, annoying bugs identified from user feedback, Twitter, and support teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. These "Little Big Updates" are bundled into popular annual launches, making users feel heard and invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

#### 3. Find Channels to Connect One-to-Many
It's crucial to go where your audience already is, rather than expecting them to come to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Twitter Immersion:** Dylan Field identified Twitter as the primary home for the design community, which had a large network of influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Figma went "all in" on Twitter, using a custom scraper built by Dylan to map out design influencers and their networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This allowed them to identify influential people to solicit feedback from and push out technical content directly into users' feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Presence:** Figma's founders and engineers actively engaged on Twitter, answering questions and interacting directly with users, humanizing the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This allowed users to passively follow Figma's progress and build confidence over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Config (Community Conference):** Config, Figma's annual conference, scaled this engagement by inviting users to submit proposals for talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This produced deep technical content and helped speakers grow their own profiles, further connecting them to Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

#### 4. Be Transparent and Authentic
Building trust requires honesty and not hiding behind the brand, even at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Public Postmortems:** In instances of downtime or service issues, Figma transparently communicated what went wrong, the technical reasons, and how it was fixed, taking full accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Open Communication during Challenges:** During the acquisition announcement, which was a highly stressful period, Figma chose to address user concerns directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. They retweeted Dylan's initial announcement and then held a public Twitter Space the next day with leadership to answer any questions from users, demonstrating their commitment to transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This approach was crucial for turning the tide of negative sentiment and encouraging users to give Figma a chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

### Step 2: Helping Internal Champions Spread the Product

Once individual contributors love the product, the next step is to empower them to introduce and expand its use throughout their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

#### 1. Make it Easy to Try and Share
Reduce friction for adoption and virality, especially in early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
*   **Generous Free Tier:** Figma allows easy sign-up for a free account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Crucially, they revised their "starter team" model to allow unlimited collaborators with a limit on files, rather than unlimited files with a limit on collaborators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This change significantly eased sharing and team adoption before requiring payment, demonstrating a clear impact on metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Free Viewers:** Figma charges only for editors, not viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. This allows product managers and other stakeholders to comment on designs for free, spreading the tool's utility deeper into organizations and making it more valuable to more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

#### 2. Leverage [[building_and_scaling_product_leadership_programs | Designer Advocates]] in the Sales Process
Integrating deeply technical, user-empathetic individuals into the sales process is a powerful amplifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **"The Tom Factor":** Figma's second designer advocate, Tom Lowry, was himself an internal champion at his previous company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. He joined the same day as Figma's first salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Tom, without a quota, became an indispensable technical expert in sales calls, explaining the product, unblocking users, and offering best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. His involvement significantly increased deal close rates, becoming known as "The Tom Factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Credibility in Sales:** Just as marketers lacked credibility with designers, salespeople would never know the product as well as a designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Advocates deeply understand user problems and can synthesize product feedback for the product team, making them invaluable for sales, marketing, and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

#### 3. Focus on an Operational Catalyst for Adoption: Design Systems
Identify and focus on features or operational efficiencies that become critical for team-wide adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Blockers:** Initially, the lack of robust Design Systems support was a major blocker for large companies adopting Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Design Systems are crucial for design consistency and efficiency, especially when collaborating with engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Community-Led Development:** Figma hosted informal meetups with the Design Systems community, learning directly from them to build features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Marketing and Features:** Figma leaned heavily into content and features around Design Systems, creating dedicated resources like `designsystems.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. They launched Schema, a conference focused on advanced Design Systems practitioners, allowing users to showcase how they use Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. Design Systems became a key upgrade driver from "Pro" to "Organization" or "Enterprise" tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

#### 4. Maintain and Grow Connection with Internal Champions
The relationship with internal champions is ongoing and must be nurtured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Engagement:** Champions can become upset if issues arise, requiring immediate attention and resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   **Amplify and Support Careers:** Figma actively helps champions grow their own profiles and careers beyond just product use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. By giving them platforms to speak at events (like Config), amplifying them on social media, and promoting them as thought leaders, Figma helps these users gain recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This creates a positive feedback loop: users gain professional growth, and Figma gains more credible advocates. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## Prerequisites for this Approach
This [[bottomup_gotomarket_strategy | go-to-market motion]] works best when:
*   **Technical, Craft-Oriented Audience:** The core individual contributor audience is technical and deeply cares about their tools and craft, willing to learn and spend significant time in the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Tool Value for ICs:** The tool provides significant value to individual users, even in a single-player mode, allowing them to build confidence before needing to collaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Existing Community:** An existing community for the target audience is already active, providing a distribution channel to connect with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Roles:** The IC audience has roles that naturally involve collaboration, making them "super spreaders" within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## [[company_growth_and_scaling_challenges | Scaling Challenges]]
As a company grows, it's crucial to protect these [[bottomup_gotomarket_strategy | bottom-up]] efforts even as more traditional, top-down methods are introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Leadership must continue to believe in the approach, relying on "signal over metrics" in early stages where quantitative data might be limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. It's easy to break what was working by adding new people or shifting focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

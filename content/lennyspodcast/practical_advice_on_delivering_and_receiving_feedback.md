Effective feedback is crucial for building stronger relationships, improving performance, and fostering a positive work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This guide, drawing insights from Kim Scott, author of *Radical Candor* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, offers practical strategies for both delivering and receiving [[giving_feedback_and_making_apologies_effectively | feedback effectively]].

## The Radical Candor Framework

[[candor_and_direct_feedback | Radical Candor]] is defined as what happens when you care personally and challenge directly at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This framework can be visualized as a 2x2 matrix:
*   **Care Personally (vertical axis)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   **Challenge Directly (horizontal axis)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>

### Common Pitfalls

The framework is best understood by what it's *not* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, as people often fail on one or both dimensions:

*   **Obnoxious Aggression**: Occurs when you challenge directly but forget to show that you care personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This involves acting like a "garden variety jerk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. It's a problem because it hurts others, is inefficient (sends people into fight-or-flight mode, preventing them from hearing you) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, and often leads to the person reacting by avoiding challenge, resulting in manipulative insincerity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Manipulative Insincerity**: The "worst place of all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This quadrant is where you neither care personally nor challenge directly, often for self-protective reasons or extreme frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Ruinous Empathy**: The most common problem, where people remember to show they care personally but fail to tell others something they'd be better off knowing in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This creates a "false harmony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Approximately 90% of mistakes fall into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example of Ruinous Empathy: Bob
> Kim Scott recounts an experience with an employee named Bob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. Bob was charming and well-liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, but consistently produced terrible, sloppy work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. Scott, liking Bob and not wanting to hurt his feelings, would offer vague, gentle feedback like, "Oh Bob, this is such a great start, you're so awesome, we all love working with you, maybe you can make it just a little bit better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This continued for 10 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a> until she had to fire him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Bob's response, "Why didn't you tell me? I thought you all cared about me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>, highlighted the pain and unfairness of ruinous empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. This failure also negatively impacted the team's top performers who were frustrated by Bob's late and low-quality deliverables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

### Benefits of Radical Candor

When individuals and teams get better at [[candor_and_direct_feedback | Radical Candor]], they build better relationships and do better work, leading to more success and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. It's about creating a culture of caring where leaders treat their direct reports with real care, which then scales throughout the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Soliciting Feedback Effectively

The first and most important step to improving relationships and making it easier to give and receive feedback is to **solicit criticism** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

*   **Avoid Vague Questions**: Asking "Do you have any feedback for me?" is often a wasted breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, as people will typically respond with "everything's fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   **Ask Authentic Questions**: Your question needs to sound authentic to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Kim Scott's preferred question is: "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Other examples include:
    *   "Tell me why I'm wrong" (used by Christa Quarls, CEO of OpenTable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.
    *   "What's one thing I could be doing better?" or "What's one way I could be helping you be more successful?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>
    *   "What could I have done this week to better support you in your work?" (from Jason Rosoff, co-founder of Radical Candor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: Managers should solicit feedback every week from each direct report, budgeting five minutes at the end of a one-on-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. Also ask cross-functional peers and your boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. Don't ask the exact same question every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>.
*   **Never Accept "No Answer"**: If someone says "everything's great," gently push back. You can say, "Look, I'm not perfect. Next time we meet, I want you to think of something. It's the thing you can do that would help me more than anything else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.
*   **Embrace Discomfort**: There's no "emotional Novocain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>. The simplest way to embrace discomfort is to close your mouth and count to six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.
*   **Listen to Understand, Not to Respond**: Your natural defensive reaction is normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. Ask follow-up questions to ensure you truly understand what the person is telling you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
*   **Reward Candor**: A person takes a huge risk giving critical feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. If you agree, fix the problem and make your listening tangible (e.g., "So-and-so told me the tea was terrible, and now we have 35 kinds of tea") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>. Ask for feedback again afterwards to see if you overcorrected or undercorrected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.
*   **Disagree Respectfully**: If you disagree, find the 5-10% you can agree with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. Then say, "As for the rest of it, I want to think about it and get back to you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. Follow up with a respectful explanation of why you disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. Unspoken disagreement, not disagreement itself, poses a risk to relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

## Delivering Feedback (Praise and Criticism)

When delivering feedback, remember these principles ("HIP core"/C.O.R.E.):
*   **Humble**: Approach the conversation with humility. [[candor_and_direct_feedback | Candor]] implies "here's how I understand the situation, I'm also curious to know how you understand it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. You might be wrong, and that's okay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Helpful (Intention)**: State your intention to be helpful; you're telling them this to help them, not to dominate or harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Immediate**: Deliver feedback almost immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Delaying it often means it will never be said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. The purpose of praise is to tell people what to do more of, and criticism is to tell them what to do less of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Exceptions exist if you or the other person are too upset to receive it productively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **In Person / Synchronously**: Have these conversations synchronously to gauge how the feedback is landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Phone calls are often better than video calls, as there can be more noise than signal in facial expressions and body language on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Avoid emails or texts, and Slack is a "feedback train wreck waiting to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **Private Criticism / Public Praise**: Praise in public, criticize in private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Personality (Avoid)**: Do not give feedback about personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Focus on observable behavior.

### C.O.R.E. Framework for Specificity

For both praise and criticism, use the C.O.R.E. (Context, Observation, Result, Next Step) framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>:

*   **Context**: The specific situation or meeting.
*   **Observation**: What you saw or heard.
*   **Result**: The impact of that observation.
*   **Next Step**: What should be done differently or more of.

> [!INFO] Example of C.O.R.E. for Criticism
>
> *   **Context**: "In the meeting..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>
> *   **Observation**: "...when you said 'um' every third word..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>
> *   **Result**: "...it made you sound stupid." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>
> *   **Next Step**: "Go to the speech coach." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>

> *   **Observation**: "...when you offered both sides of the argument..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>
> *   **Result**: "...it earned you credibility." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>
> *   **Next Step**: "Do more of that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>

### Adjusting Delivery Based on Reception

*   **Keep Pushing if Brushed Off**: If the person seems to be brushing off your feedback, you need to "move out on the [[candor_and_direct_feedback | challenge directly]] dimension" and be prepared to keep going until you've communicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.
*   **Move Up on Care Personally if Upset**: If the person looks sad or mad, that's your cue to move up on the "care personally" dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:44">[00:55:44]</a>. Instead of pulling back your words (which leads to ruinous empathy), acknowledge their emotion and rephrase with care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. For example, "I feel like maybe I didn't say that in the best possible way, how could I have said it differently?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. If they're angry, "get curious, not furious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a> and say, "Look, maybe I didn't say that in the right way, but this is an important issue and we need to resolve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges

### "People-Pleaser" Tendencies

It's natural to want to be liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. To overcome this:
*   **Shift Focus to Caring**: Realize your job is not to be liked, but to care about other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. Become "others-focused" instead of "self-focused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Kindness**: Understand that it's actually unkind not to give feedback that someone needs to hear in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>.
*   **Career Conversations**: As a manager, show you care by having real, meaningful [[strategies_for_conducting_effective_referral_calls_and_performance_reviews | career conversations]] with direct reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. This includes discussing their past, future dreams, and creating a career action plan with skills to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.

### Unwelcoming Company Culture

If your company culture isn't ready for [[candor_and_direct_feedback | direct feedback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>:
*   **Start with Soliciting Feedback**: The order of operations for [[candor_and_direct_feedback | radical candor]] begins with soliciting criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>. This builds trust and makes it easier to give and receive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.
*   **Address Bias and Bullying**: Be aware of and address how bias, prejudice, and bullying can impact feedback reception (e.g., a Black woman CEO being labeled an "angry black woman" for direct feedback) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>. Leaders are more prone to bullying even if they don't see themselves as bullies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **Show Impact to Leaders**: For leaders with low self-awareness or those who use obnoxious aggression, explain the negative impact their behavior has on results and their own careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. Share personal stories of acting like a "jerk" and their consequences to encourage self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.
*   **Reject False Dichotomies**: Challenge the notion that you must choose between being a "total jerk but really competent" or "really nice but incompetent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>. [[candor_and_direct_feedback | Radical Candor]] demonstrates a third way that works better and doesn't hurt people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. It's possible to be a successful, kind person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Practice

*   **It's a "Dialogue, Not a Monologue"**: [[candor_and_direct_feedback | Candor]] is a give-and-take, not just telling someone "the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   **Relationship Hygiene**: Giving and soliciting feedback should be like "brushing and flossing" – consistent and quick two-minute conversations, not major interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Time**: It doesn't necessarily add meetings, but it requires emotional discipline and sometimes being willing to be late to your next meeting if a moment for feedback arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. Neglecting this often leads to more time-intensive problems later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>.
*   **Listen to Emotional Signals**: Communicate on both emotional and intellectual levels. Ignoring emotional signals or telling someone "don't take it personally" hinders effective communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.
*   **Build Compassion**: To [[effective_listening_and_communication_as_a_leader | build compassion]] and better understand emotional signals, read more novels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>.

> [!TIP] Tactical Next Step:
> Write down your go-to question for soliciting feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. Practice it in front of a mirror and with a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. Then, put five minutes in your calendar to ask that question of someone, or add it to your next one-on-one agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.

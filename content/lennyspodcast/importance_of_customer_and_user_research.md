Customer and user research are fundamental to creating successful products. While some believe that simply having a good idea is 90% of the work, the reality is that the [[Leveraging User Insights for Product Development | craftsmanship of going from an idea to a product]] is where the real value is created through a process known as product discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

## Focus on Solution Discovery

People don't buy the problem; they buy the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While a solution must address something users care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, the critical question for product success is whether your solution is better than competitors' offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Product teams should prioritize saving as much time as possible to develop a winning solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While understanding the problem is important, extensive "problem validation" or verifying what a founder already knows can be a waste of precious time that should be spent on solution discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

## Empowered Product Teams and User Insights

In effective product organizations, teams are given problems to solve rather than a prioritized list of features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. These teams are empowered with the skills to devise the best solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This approach aligns with the "Netflix principle" of pushing decisions down to those with the most knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Since product teams regularly interact with users and customers, they are ideally positioned to make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

This means that product managers, designers, and engineers are not merely implementing ideas handed to them, but rather collaborating as peers to create a great experience and a great solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The designer's role extends beyond aesthetics to actively contribute to the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## The Product Manager's Role in Discovery

A crucial part of the product manager's role is to ensure that a discovered solution is valuable and viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This involves:
*   Becoming an expert on users and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. This goes beyond personal assumptions, requiring direct engagement like visiting customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>.
*   Being an expert in product data, including how the product is used and changes over time, as well as sales and user analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>. This is another way of [[Understanding and analyzing user behavior | understanding and analyzing user behavior]].
*   Understanding different aspects of the business, such as marketing, sales, monetization, compliance, regulatory, privacy, and security issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>. This helps [[balancing_user_research_with_business_goals | balance user research with business goals]].
*   Knowing the competitive landscape, industry trends, and key players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.

These areas of knowledge enable the product manager to contribute essential insights to the team that engineers and designers typically don't possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

## The True Purpose of User Research

User research is not just about validating problems or getting users to say they like a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. Instead, its primary goal is to build a refined mental model of the user and customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

When performing user research, especially in the solution discovery phase, the focus should be on finding all the reasons why users *wouldn't* like or use your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. This is known as evaluative user research and provides the most valuable insights for product improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

A critical rule for effective user research is that the product manager and designer must be present during user tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. If they are not available, the test should be canceled because their direct observation is essential for the research to be useful to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. Engineers' involvement is also super important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>.

## Avoiding the "Feature Factory" Trap

Many companies operate as "feature teams" or "feature factories," where roadmaps are essentially prioritized lists of features handed down by stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. In this model, product teams are primarily focused on implementing possible solutions, with little room for true innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

This "disease" of focusing solely on features often occurs when companies achieve significant market share and stop prioritizing innovation, leading to a focus on "value capture" (optimization) over "value creation" (discovery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. The absence of real discovery is often "the beginning of the end" for product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

### Shifting from Feature Team to Product Team

For a feature team to transition into a "real product team," they can try an experiment over a quarter or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>:
1.  **Identify the problem to solve**: Instead of focusing on a given feature, understand the underlying problem it's meant to address and how success will be measured (e.g., conversion rate, average shopping cart value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
2.  **Product Manager Preparation**: The product manager needs to develop essential skills in user and customer knowledge, data analysis, business understanding, and competitive landscape awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. This ensures they can lead the team in finding valuable and viable solutions.
3.  **Strategic Context**: The team needs a clear understanding of the product vision, product strategy, and how their work fits into the broader company objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
4.  **Discovery Skills**: Teams need to learn and apply modern discovery techniques to effectively explore and validate solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>. Books like "Continuous Discovery Habits" and "Sprint" can be valuable resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

### The Three Sacred Responsibilities of a Product Manager

To innovate and build great products, a product manager must have unencumbered access to three critical areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>:
1.  **Users and Customers**: Direct access is crucial; anyone trying to mediate this access is hindering the product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>. This directly impacts [[incorporating_user_feedback_into_product_development | incorporating user feedback into product development]].
2.  **Engineers**: Product managers must work daily with engineers on solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>. Mediating roles like "product owner" or "project manager" that sit between the PM and engineers can prevent innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
3.  **Stakeholders**: Access to stakeholders is vital to ensure the product works for the business, addressing aspects like monetization and market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.

Delegating other responsibilities (like project management or quality assurance) away from the product manager can be beneficial for efficiency, but these three core areas must remain untouched to maintain product effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.

### The Danger of "Process People"

A significant trend that harms product management is the over-reliance on process for scaling, driven by "process people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. While scaling is challenging, the effective way to do it is through leaders, not rigid processes that essentially repackage outdated methodologies like waterfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This focus on process can lead to a high proportion of unqualified product professionals, particularly when agile coaches teach product owners without real product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>. This highlights a concern for [[how_to_evaluate_and_hire_effective_ux_researchers | evaluating and hiring effective UX researchers]] and product managers, and for the broader [[the_state_of_ux_research_in_the_tech_industry | state of UX research in the tech industry]].

[[Key strategies and practices for effective product management and team building | Product management]] involves continuously including the customer in the decision-making process for what to build [00:23:40]. Effective interviewing is a crucial component of this, helping teams understand unmet needs, pain points, and desires [00:16:12]. Teresa Torres, author of *Continuous Discovery Habits*, emphasizes that interviewing is a "grossly underestimated skill" [00:16:01].

## The Purpose of Interviews
Every item in a product backlog is a "bet" [00:00:00]. [[Continuous Discovery habits | Discovery]] helps teams make better bets by building continuous feedback loops with customers [00:23:45]. Interviews are a primary way to gather rich stories that inform these decisions [00:14:26].

## Common Interviewing Mistakes
Many teams make common errors when conducting interviews that lead to unreliable data:
*   **Asking direct questions out of context** Questions like "What do you like to watch on Netflix?" or "How do you decide what to watch?" prompt fast answers that don't necessarily reflect actual behavior or capture important context and nuance [00:14:38].
*   **Focusing on hypothetical situations** Interviewers often ask what people *would do* or *think*, or *why* they might do something. This approach yields unreliable information because it doesn't reflect actual behavior [00:40:47].
*   **Staying shallow** Teams tend to move quickly from one point to the next without digging deeper into customer experiences, missing valuable insights into friction points or needs [00:39:24].
*   **Over-planning with numerous questions** Relying on long, detailed interview protocols with dozens of questions can prevent a natural conversation flow [00:36:38].

## Best Practices for Effective Interviews
To overcome these challenges and conduct more impactful interviews, focus on these techniques:

### Collect Customer Stories
The most effective way to gather reliable information is to ask customers to tell stories about their past behaviors [00:15:14].
*   **Start with a broad, open-ended question:** Instead of asking about preferences, ask about a recent specific experience. For example, "Tell me about the last time you watched something on a streaming entertainment service" [00:37:40].
*   **Focus on the "what happened next":** Once a story begins, maintain curiosity by asking clarifying questions that help the interviewee elaborate on the timeline of events. Examples include "Set the scene for me, where were you?" [00:37:51], "What did you do next?" [00:38:12], or "How come?" [00:38:32].
*   **Be a curious "five-year-old":** Continuously ask "why" or "what happened next" to uncover deeper insights and context [00:39:41].
*   **Summarize to show listening:** Periodically summarize what you've heard to show you're engaged and bring the interviewee back to moments where you want more detail [00:39:49].

### Cultivate a Natural Conversation
The goal is for the interview to feel like "having a beer with a buddy" â€“ casual and conversational [00:36:56]. This allows for a deeper and more authentic exploration of customer needs and pain points.

### Prioritize Behavior Over Opinions
Product teams are in the business of changing behavior [00:40:37]. Therefore, the focus of interviews should be on understanding "what did you actually do" rather than what customers say they *would* do or *think* [00:40:58].

### Embrace Continuous Curiosity
By continuously asking "what happened next" and exploring the timeline of a customer's experience, interviewers can uncover unmet needs and pain points that the customer might not even be consciously aware of [00:39:58]. This leads to discovering information that teams "would have never thought to ask about" [00:40:00].

## Sustaining Continuous Interviews
For [[key_skills_for_product_managers | product managers]] to effectively engage in [[continuous_discovery_habits | continuous discovery]], interviews need to be a regular habit.

### Automating the Recruiting Process
To make interviewing sustainable and reduce friction, teams can automate the recruiting process [00:27:09].
*   **In-product opt-ins:** Embed a simple question within the product, similar to an NPS survey, asking "Do you have 20 minutes to talk to us?" If a customer says yes, direct them to scheduling software [00:27:52]. Tools like Qualaroo, Ethnio, Intercom, Usabilla, and Hotjar can facilitate this [00:29:39].
*   **Leverage internal teams:** For B2B products or decision-makers, internal teams like sales, account managers, or support staff who are already in contact with customers can recruit participants [00:28:34]. Teams can define a weekly trigger (e.g., "looking to talk to someone experiencing this pain point") and use scheduling software to book interviews directly onto the product team's calendar [00:28:50].

### Managing Stakeholder Concerns
When stakeholders express cynicism about relying on a small number of interviews (e.g., "based on one interview"), remind them that even "one is better than zero" data points [00:43:02]. The goal of product work is to change behavior, and interviews, especially when coupled with small, iterative experiments and robust instrumentation, provide sufficient data to make informed decisions and continuously improve [00:43:28].

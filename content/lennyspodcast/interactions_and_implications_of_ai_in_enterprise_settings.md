The application of artificial intelligence in enterprise settings presents unique challenges and opportunities, distinct from consumer-facing products. This environment often requires different product development strategies, user education, and a rethinking of traditional product management roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:02">[03:22:02]</a>.

## Unique Aspects of Enterprise AI Product Development

Developing AI products for enterprise involves a different set of considerations compared to consumer products:

*   **Longer Timelines and Feedback Loops**: Unlike consumer products that see immediate user feedback, enterprise products often involve lengthy requisition and deployment phases, sometimes taking months before feedback is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:07">[04:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:11">[04:09:11]</a>. The feedback, however, can be more direct and financially incentivized, as clients can directly communicate their needs and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:31">[04:29:31]</a>.
*   **Buyer vs. User**: In enterprise, there's a crucial distinction between the "buyer" who has goals and the "user" who interacts with the product. A product might be great for individual users, but if it doesn't align with the buyer's objectives, it won't succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. This also includes the need for advance notice for product launches, requiring a different planning cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Deterministic Nature of AI**: AI models introduce a non-deterministic element; the same inputs may not always yield the exact same outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This challenges the long-standing intuition about how computers work and requires new approaches to product design, such as establishing feedback mechanisms, guard rails, and understanding aggregate behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## AI Capabilities and Product Design

The [[impact_of_ai_on_software_and_business | impact of AI on software and business]] means product managers must adapt to rapidly evolving AI capabilities:

*   **Designing for Imperfection (e.g., 60% Success)**: Many AI tasks might only be "60% good," meaning they're not perfect but still provide significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. Product design must account for this by incorporating a "human in the loop," allowing for editing and refinement, as seen with tools like GitHub Copilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. The value lies in saving time, even if the AI isn't fully autonomous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.
*   **The Crucial Role of Evaluations (Evals)**: A core skill for product managers in an AI-powered world is developing and refining evaluations (evals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>. Models can be "eval limited" rather than "intelligence limited," meaning their performance often depends on how well they are taught and evaluated for specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. This means PMS need to understand what success looks like, define robust evaluations, and iteratively improve models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:47]</a>. Even the models themselves can assist in writing and grading evals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.
*   **Deep Technical Understanding**: [[impact_of_ai_on_skills_and_products | Product managers]] are increasingly pushed to understand deeper aspects of the tech stack, including model capabilities, even if they aren't researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>. This includes appreciating the differences between "system one" thinking (immediate answers) and "system two" thinking (reasoning and hypothesis testing) in models like `o1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>.
*   **Orchestration of Models**: Advanced enterprise applications often involve orchestrating multiple AI models, each used for its specific strengths, to accomplish complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a>. For example, one model might reason, another might be precise with inputs/outputs, and others might check results, mirroring how human teams with diverse skill sets collaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:34:00">[32:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:07:00">[33:07:00]</a>.
*   **Automating Drudgery**: AI is being applied to automate repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing up human time for creative work. Examples include UI testing and data manipulation for support or finance teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:39:00">[28:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>.

## Educating Enterprise Users about AI

The widespread adoption of AI in enterprise requires strategic user education due to its often unintuitive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>:

*   **Rapid User Adaptation**: While initially unintuitive, users adapt remarkably quickly to new AI capabilities, even if they initially perceive them as "magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>. Products like ChatGPT, less than two years old, have already shifted user expectations dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>.
*   **Product as Educator**: The product itself can be designed to be educational, providing information about its capabilities and how to use new features. This can include direct links to documentation and step-by-step assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Power Users**: Within organizations, power users can act as evangelists, creating custom AI tools (like custom GPTs) and educating their non-technical colleagues on how to use AI effectively, thereby driving broader adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>.

## [[future_implications_of_ai_for_product_management | Future implications of AI for product management]] in Enterprise

The evolution of AI promises transformative experiences in enterprise settings:

*   **Proactivity**: Future models are expected to be more proactive, anticipating user needs by monitoring communications (with authorization) and providing timely information, such as meeting recaps, research, or first drafts of presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>.
*   **Asynchronous Interaction**: AI could enable more asynchronous workflows, where models "think" for extended periods (hours or days) to complete complex, multi-stage tasks, freeing users from needing immediate responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>. This could allow AI to tackle mini-projects, fix bugs, or adapt documents based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>.
*   **Multimodal Interaction**: As models become more intelligent at an accelerating rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31:00">[35:31:00]</a>, they will interact in more human-like ways, beyond just typing. This includes advanced voice modes for real-time translation or vision capabilities, expanding their utility in various business contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>.
*   **Model Personality and Personalization**: The "personality" and behavior of models are becoming key aspects of product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:43:00">[39:43:00]</a>. Users are starting to develop a "two-way empathy" with models, treating them almost as persons or entities. The question of how much a model should customize its personality to an individual user versus maintaining a distinct brand personality is an ongoing area of exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:35:00">[40:35:00]</a>. This [[future_implications_of_personalized_ai | future implications of personalized AI]] is particularly relevant in enterprise settings, where interactions might become more tailored to individual roles or preferences.

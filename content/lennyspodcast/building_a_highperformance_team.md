Ramp is recognized as the fastest-growing SaaS business in history, achieving over $100 million in annual run rate within two years with an R&D department of under 50 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Jeff Charles, VP of Product at Ramp, attributes this success to a unique approach to product development that prioritizes moving quickly, thinking from first principles, and empowering individual team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Core Principles

### Velocity
Velocity is central to Ramp's operation, influencing product development, team incentives, hiring, promotion, decision-making, and organizational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This focus originated from a small team facing a large market opportunity during the pandemic, where speed of execution was paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. High velocity enables teams to achieve impact through rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, attracts top talent seeking to build and ship quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, and de-risks decision-making by making the cost of incorrect decisions low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

Examples of Ramp's velocity include:
*   Building a competitor to MX in three months with about eight engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
*   Developing a competitor to Expensify six months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   Launching an accounts payable product, a competitor to Bill.com, in three months with a team of three engineers, one designer, and one product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This product now processes billions of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Empowerment: Context Over Control
Ramp fosters an environment where product teams are empowered with significant control over their operations and what they build, rather than being micromanaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This "context over control" approach relies on deep alignment on goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Leaders provide context, ensuring teams understand the problem, hypothesis, supporting data, and potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Solutions are best derived from teams closest to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

The contract between leadership and teams is based on strategy and roadmap alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Teams are expected to highlight risks and one-way decisions requiring senior input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Leaders act as "repeaters in chief," constantly sharing context and reinforcing key objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

### Lofty Goals
Ramp sets ambitious goals, often inspired by publicly traded competitors like Bill.com and Expensify, which serve as strong motivators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Design is also used as a motivational tool, with significant time spent crafting visionary prototypes that excite teams about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The company is very revenue-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### Thinking from First Principles
Given Ramp's unique business model—combining credit card, payments, and software for both SMBs and enterprises—thinking from first principles is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. This means avoiding pattern matching from past experiences and instead returning to fundamental principles to deeply understand and solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. This approach requires hiring individuals who can set aside prior experience and embrace complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

An example is Ramp's support team, which reports directly to product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. The first principle was: "Every support ticket is a failure of our product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This accountability drives the product team to minimize issues. The second principle was the belief that value comes from deeply understanding and responding to customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. This led to hiring support agents incentivized to decrease ticket volume rather than just resolve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. This approach results in an extremely low contact rate despite a large user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.

## Operationalizing High Performance

### Team Structure and Focus
Ramp emphasizes small, single-threaded teams with a clear focus on one goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. These teams are shielded from external distractions and given big, lofty goals with tight timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Leadership protects these core teams from issues and escalations via rotational programs (e.g., production engineering) and product operators who handle documentation, release management, and customer requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

For big bets, sub-teams are formed by pulling individuals from different teams, and these teams typically have no responsibility for existing products, allowing them to focus entirely on the new initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

### Minimizing Bureaucracy
Ramp actively reduces common organizational overhead:
*   **Meetings and Status Updates:** Considered a "biggest waste of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. Status updates are done asynchronously in the systems where work operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. Meetings are reserved for collaboration, ideation, and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.
*   **Excessive Planning:** While strategic alignment is crucial, detailed quarterly planning is minimized. Ramp moved from a month-long quarterly planning process (33% of time) to a bi-annual one-pager outlining company priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. This approach focuses on accuracy only for high-value events, like large market launches, and allows most teams to operate autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.
*   **OKRs:** Primarily used for cross-functional initiatives or financial goals rather than detailed product team measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. The product roadmap serves as the core contract for product teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
*   **Low-Leverage PM Work:** Tasks like writing detailed tickets are largely pushed to engineering teams, who are accountable for breaking down their own work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

### Feedback and Accountability
Despite high velocity, quality is maintained through clear feedback loops:
*   **Voice of Customer:** Every negative review is shared monthly with the relevant tech lead, product manager, and designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Metrics:** NPS, CSAT, and "operational overhead" (percentage of support tickets from a product area normalized by users) are regularly reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. Product teams are expected to maintain low operational burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **Direct Bug Assignment:** Bugs are directly assigned to the engineer on call to ensure they "feel the pain" and prioritize fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **Feature Shipping Control:** If customer confusion (tracked by support tickets) is elevated, teams are restricted from shipping new features until issues are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

## Talent and Hiring
Ramp's velocity is fundamentally supported by the quality of its engineering and design talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Key aspects of [[Hiring and developing a growth team | hiring and developing a growth team]] include:
*   **Investment in R&D:** Recognizing R&D as a first-class citizen, paying top market rates, and building a strong tech brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Empowered Technical Organization:** The CEO sets the vision but is less prescriptive about specific execution, trusting the empowered tech organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   **Mentality and Culture:** Look for engineers who want to win in the market, care about beating competitors, understand the business context, are curious, proactive, and accountable for their product's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. They should drive the pace, challenge decisions, and jump in to help without being asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.
*   **Interview Focus:** Emphasize a strong desire for impact and the ability to think deeply over mere experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. A common interview question is "What's the hardest thing you've ever done?" to assess their understanding of "hard" and their agency in overcoming challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

## Preventing Burnout
Counterintuitively, velocity can help avoid burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. Burnout often occurs when effort doesn't translate into tangible impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. By eliminating distractions and bureaucracy, Ramp enables individuals to enter a "flow state" where work is thrilling and impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. [[Creating and maintaining team culture and passion | Creating and maintaining team culture and passion]] by making everyone feel like it's "their goal" and "their mini-company" leads to sustained motivation and prevents burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

## The Role of Writing and Thinking
Writing is a critical tool for individual product leaders and teams to clarify thoughts, crystallize problems, and arrive at solutions from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. Instead of immediately seeking external answers, writing helps in "doing the thinking" to increase cognitive capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>. This also serves as an effective communication method, especially in a distributed or fast-growing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

To facilitate deep work and thinking, leaders should block out dedicated time, minimize meetings, and turn off notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. Keeping a robust, simple task management system helps free up headspace by writing down all tasks and organizing them for quick retrieval, rather than relying on memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.

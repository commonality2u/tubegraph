The field of growth is relatively new, leading to a lot of interest in quick "growth hacks" that often lack context or are specific to unique examples, making them inapplicable as general patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This often results in a high failure rate for growth teams, with many heads of growth being replaced due to unmet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Elena Verna, a leading expert in B2B growth, shares common growth tactics that frequently fail, wasting significant resources.

## Tactics That Never Work

### Hiring a Growth Team Too Soon
There's a significant misconception that a startup needs a growth team to achieve growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. This is "absolutely not true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. For a company to initiate growth, the founder and founding team must first figure out how to scale to between one to ten million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Some companies don't even form growth teams until they reach \$100-200 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

Key reasons to delay hiring a growth team:
*   **Product-Market Fit (PMF)**: Growth cannot be outsourced to a team if the core [[challenges_in_early_startup_growth_and_product_pivots | product-market fit]] hasn't been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. PMF means having a solution to a problem with customers who not only use it but also retain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Data Volume**: A growth team requires a substantial volume of users to run experiments, learn, optimize, and innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Ten users do not constitute enough data for a growth team to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

Founder-led growth is crucial in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The longer a company waits to hire a dedicated growth team, the better, as it trains the entire company to be responsible for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

*   **B2B SaaS**: For B2B SaaS, if revenue collection primarily happens through a sales team, sales hires should precede growth hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Growth teams are less critical in sales-led companies; a "growth marketing" team might simply be a rebranded demand generation team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. A growth person is needed when starting with self-serve monetization or relying on product-led activation and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

### Hiring a Head of Growth When Business is Declining
Bringing in a "shiny growth head" to fix a business slowdown or decline is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. If the overall business is slowing down, a head of growth is "destined to fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Growth teams can optimize and perhaps lift metrics by 10-15%, but they cannot fix core product or marketing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

A growth team amplifies good [[challenges_in_early_startup_growth_and_product_pivots | product-market fit]] and accelerates growth when it's already occurring. If there are fundamental problems with the go-to-market strategy or core product, growth teams are "absolutely helpless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. It's a waste of resources to expect miracles from a growth team when the underlying business is in decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

*   **When to Hire**: For an established company, hire a head of growth only after the core product and marketing teams have at least plateaued the decline and ideally shown some signs of immediate life and potential for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

### Rebranding or Redesigning for Growth
Rebranding or redesigning, especially a marketing site, almost never produces good performance results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. While necessary for new markets or product evolution, these are lagging indicators that require significant post-launch optimization to even return to previous performance levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

New CMOs often redesign based on personal taste, promising increased acquisition, but it rarely materializes into anything meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. Such efforts involve significant spending (often over \$1 million), lengthy development (8-10 months), and result in "very lackluster results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.

> "Every single time I've seen a marketing site at least Rebrand it's been a step back in performance that then is being treated as a fire drill to fix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>

If undertaking a redesign, assume a performance hit at launch and allocate at least three to six months for post-launch optimization to recover and potentially outperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

### Obsessing Over Competition / Blindly Copying
While understanding and being inspired by competitors is important, blindly copying their tactics or flows is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Every experience is unique to its customer and channel, and you often don't know the full context of what you're copying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.

> "It fails 95% of the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>

Copying skips crucial steps like ideation, user research, customer interviews, and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. It leads to mediocrity, as leaders innovate, they don't copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

*   **Benchmarks**: Benchmarks derived from competitors are also dangerous because definitions of metrics vary widely between companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Use them as an input to understand possibilities, but never as a blind target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.
*   **Inspiration vs. Copying**: Use competitors to understand general frameworks (e.g., sharing models) and identify common, winning elements. This helps avoid starting from scratch, providing a strong input for ideation, but never a final solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

### Thinking Your Problem is Unique
Many companies mistakenly believe their growth problems are unique and try to re-engineer solutions from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. This wastes time and incurs huge opportunity costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.

> "Your problem is not unique. I am 99% sure of that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>

Your problem has likely been faced and solved (or failed at) by others.
*   **Leverage Networks**: Find and talk to people who have solved similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. LinkedIn and professional networks are valuable resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. This is an "incredible shortcut" to an optimal solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.
*   **Patternization**: Focus on finding frameworks that solve not only the current problem but also similar future problems, enabling faster implementation of solutions (0 to 60% of the solution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.

### Over-prioritizing SEO, SEM, and Social (Paid Channels)
Growth teams often prioritize organic search (SEO), paid search (SEM), and social media advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>. While valuable, these channels are owned by others (e.g., Google, Instagram), and algorithms can change, taking away your control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.

The primary focus for a growth team should be creating their "owned or earned channel" where nobody else can compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.
*   **Earned Channels**: This relates to [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | product-led growth]] acquisition, relying on virality, word-of-mouth, and user-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.
    *   **Example**: Dropbox's sharing model, where over 50% of acquisition comes from users sharing files, creating a stable, earned channel that competitors cannot replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.
*   **Importance**: Focusing on earned channels is crucial as search interfaces evolve towards AI, reducing content visibility and increasing acquisition costs on traditional paid channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. Growth teams failing to invest in virality and user-generated content risk their future growth being at the mercy of external platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.

### Not Layering Different Growth Models
Relying solely on one growth model (e.g., product-led or sales/marketing-led) is a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. Just as products need continuous evolution of [[challenges_in_early_startup_growth_and_product_pivots | product-market fit]], growth models also need to evolve.

*   **Law of Shitty Click-Throughs**: Over-optimizing the same growth model will eventually lead to minimal returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Many growth models have limited lifespans, typically five to seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.
*   **Continuous Evolution**: Continuously overlaying different growth models (product-led, marketing-led, sales-led) on top of existing ones is crucial for sustained long-term [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>. This diversification prevents a single model's failure from derailing the entire business.
*   **Proactive Approach**: Don't wait for growth to slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. Introduce new growth loops or channels every 18 months, with a major new engine taking a significant portion of volume every five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. Allocate 20-25% of a growth team's annual time to new initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. Many of these attempts will fail, but the investment is vital for long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.

### Not Hiring Advisors
Not hiring advisors is a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. Advisors provide access to a network of people with valuable data points and patterns, accelerating progress significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>. They serve as additional input for decision-making, offering insights from their experiences at other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

> "Any growth team that does not have an adviser is a growth team that is underperforming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>

*   **Vetting Advisors**: Instead of blindly hiring, conduct a workshop with potential advisors on a specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. Pay them for the workshop to assess their interaction with your team and their ability to provide actionable insights. Avoid advisors who are guarded about their knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate an advisor's value monthly. While not tied to monetary attribution, ensure they offer valuable insights and conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>.

### Too Much Risk-Averseness / Experimenting on Everything
Excessive experimentation, where "every single one of your initiatives...is an experiment," is a paralyzing "disease" for growth teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>. It slows down progress, velocity, and learnings, leading to terrible consequences for output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>.

*   **Trust Intuition**: People should trust their intuition more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>. If a test will take eight months to yield a significant sample size, it's not worth running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>. A general rule of thumb is to avoid testing if the sample size cannot be collected within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>.
*   **Pre-vs-Post Analysis**: Use pre-versus-post analysis for assessment, allowing for rollbacks if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.
*   **Strategic vs. Iterative**: Reserve scientific experimentation for big, strategic pivots or high-traffic areas where even small differences mean significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. For other initiatives, "just go for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.
*   **Debilitating Effect**: Testing everything is debilitating and paralyzes growth teams, as they become afraid to make any changes without prior testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.

### Quick Fire Round - Small Ineffective Tactics

*   **Color Optimizations**: Spending time testing shades of colors (e.g., blue vs. green) for buttons is an outdated tactic from the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. Pick a color that's accessible and bright, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Signups for Acquisition**: Adding Google, Facebook, or Slack OAuth doesn't generally drive more acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. It mostly shifts existing users to a different signup method, without creating incrementality, improving activation, or retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. It's a customer experience investment, not a [[sales_strategies_for_startups | growth strategy]]. (Exception: developer products should offer GitHub OAuth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>.
*   **One-off Emails**: Stressing over a single email to a customer group will "never cause any lift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. Too few people open or click them. Email should be considered a series and a part of a larger communication strategy, not a one-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.
*   **Removing Friction (Simplifying Onboarding)**: Growth teams are often too obsessed with removing steps or simplifying things to an "oblivion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>. While fixing *horrible* friction (e.g., cognitive load, confusion) is important, simplifying for its own sake is a failed growth tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>. "Simplifying onboarding" should never be a roadmap item because it's an action, not the problem being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. The problem is typically confusion, being lost, or lack of education, for which simplifying might be a solution, but not a problem in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.

## Recommended Growth Frameworks
Elena Verna recommends the following frameworks, viewing them as patterns and starting points for ideation:

*   **Growth Loops**: Focuses on action-reaction cycles that generate new actions, creating self-contained flywheels for [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | sustainable growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>.
*   **Race Car Framework**: Helps categorize growth initiatives into engines (loops), fuel (paid marketing), turbo boosts (big events), and lubrication (optimizations) to understand their long-term vs. short-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.
*   **Adjacent User Theory (Bengali)**: Powerful for considering growth evolution beyond the ideal customer profile, optimizing experiences for "adjacent users" to bring in new customers without necessarily expanding the core [[challenges_in_early_startup_growth_and_product_pivots | product-market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>.

## Contrarian Corner: Career Optionality

Elena's contrarian opinion is that full-time jobs are not the best way to monetize skills for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. Many blindly default to this package without exploring other options that might be better suited for their personality, interests, and skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>.

While full-time roles are valuable for learning and gaining expertise, they can limit individuals to one company that may not be a great fit culturally or for their ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:28">[01:20:28]</a>.

*   **Other Options**: Freelancing, contracting, advising, consulting (working horizontally across many companies), interim engagements (predetermined end dates), fractional engagements (part-time), creating courses, or newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:59">[01:20:59]</a>.
*   **Career Optionality**: The ultimate goal should be "career optionality," having the choice to pursue what aligns with your life, skills, and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>. This means evaluating opportunities based on whether they increase your option pool, rather than just chasing titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:08">[01:24:08]</a>.
*   **Earning Your Right**: Building depth and real experience, often through full-time jobs, is essential to "earn your right to unlock optionality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:59">[01:24:59]</a>. However, it's a menu of options, and you can switch between full-time, advisory, or other roles throughout your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a>.

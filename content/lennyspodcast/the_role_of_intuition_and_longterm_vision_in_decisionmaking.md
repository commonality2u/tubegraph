Shopify, a highly successful e-commerce platform, employs unique [[examples_and_advice_on_decisionmaking_frameworks_for_managers_and_leaders | decision-making frameworks]] that emphasize [[the_art_of_decisionmaking_and_intuition_in_business | intuition]], taste, and a long-term outlook, rather than solely relying on short-term metrics or KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This approach is deeply embedded in the company's culture and strategy.

## The 100-Year Vision
Shopify's priorities and [[decision_making_in_product_management | product roadmap]] are primarily driven by a "hundred-year vision" set by CEO Tobi Lütke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. This long-term perspective influences all aspects of the business, from capital investment to [[importance_of_strategy_and_decision_making_in_product_management | product decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. The core mission is to increase entrepreneurship on the internet and make it as easy as possible to start an online store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

This vision prioritizes fostering new businesses over chasing immediate revenue from large enterprise clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. The reasoning is that current "big brands" may not exist in 30-50 years, whereas enabling new entrepreneurs ensures Shopify's success over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>. This long-term view allows for strategic investments that may not yield immediate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Prioritizing Intuition and Taste Over Metrics
Unlike many companies, Shopify's core product teams do not have metrics or KPIs; these are "essentially banned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Instead, [[decision_making_in_product_management | decisions]] are made based on taste, [[the_art_of_decisionmaking_and_intuition_in_business | intuition]], and building towards the long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. While data is still used as a piece of the puzzle, it is not the "overwriting" factor for accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>.

The benefit of this approach is that it allows core teams to ship more forward-facing and potentially riskier features without being constrained by short-term metric optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:28">[01:29:28]</a>.

### Long-Term Experimentation
Shopify's growth team, led by Archie Abrams, utilizes a unique experimentation strategy that aligns with the company's [[the_importance_of_longterm_career_planning | long-term career planning]] and vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>:
*   **Long-term Holdouts** Shopify keeps long-term holdouts for every experiment, automatically looking at the impact of these experiments a year, two years, or even three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This allows them to revisit initial [[decision_making_in_product_management | decisions]] and see the true, downstream effects on gross merchandise volume (GMV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **Re-evaluation of "Winners"** Approximately 30-40% of experiments that show short-term lift (e.g., increased paying shops or first sales) actually show "no incremental lift" on GMV a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This is often due to "pulling forward" success that would have happened anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. An example is payment failure notifications: while short-term alerts boosted recovery, there was no long-term GMV lift because those merchants were likely not dedicated to entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Uncovering Hidden Value** Conversely, some experiments that show *neutral* short-term results can have a massive positive impact over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. For instance, pre-filled sections in the online store editor initially showed no lift in converting to a paying merchant. However, six months later, it had a "pretty massive impact" on sales and GMV because it helped merchants create better-converting stores, leading to early sales and sustained momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.

### Shipping "Neutral" Experiments
Based on these long-term learnings, Shopify's culture supports shipping "neutral" experiments if there is good [[the_art_of_decisionmaking_and_intuition_in_business | intuition]] that it will benefit merchants long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The philosophy is to ask: "What would we have shipped if we were blank slate?" If the test is neutral, they choose the option they feel better about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:51">[01:41:51]</a>.

## The "Aim Heavy" Philosophy
This approach is referred to as "aim heavy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. It signifies a strong conviction in the intended direction and product quality, even if immediate metrics don't provide clear validation. This is supported by the motto: "The plan is the plan until it's not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:32">[01:44:32]</a>. This combines focused planning with flexibility, allowing the company to adapt while maintaining a strong strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:46">[01:44:46]</a>.

## Founder's Influence on Decision-Making
Tobi Lütke, being an engineer by background, places significant emphasis on the "how" – specifically, the technical architecture – believing it determines strategy more than the "what" or "who" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:06">[01:45:06]</a>. This means Shopify is willing to take longer to ship features to ensure the underlying technical foundation is adaptable and flexible for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:32">[01:45:32]</a>. For example, discussions about CSV importers for merchant migration delve into extreme technical detail to ensure robust infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.

## Challenges and Prerequisites for an Intuition-Driven Approach
While beneficial, an [[the_art_of_decisionmaking_and_intuition_in_business | intuition]] and taste-driven approach has its challenges:
*   **Subjectivity** Conversations can become "extremely subjective" about what is the "right thing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:42">[01:49:42]</a>.
*   **Need for Strong Leadership** For this model to work, it requires a "very opinionated founder" or a "set of folks who have extremely strong opinions on what good is and what taste is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:41">[01:59:41]</a>. Without metrics for accountability, strong leadership is crucial to maintain a consistent quality bar and prevent teams from building "a bunch of cool stuff" in a haphazard way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:50">[01:59:50]</a>. At Shopify, Tobi Lütke and Glenn Coates (Head of Core Product) are key in enforcing this bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>. Every project requires a "-2 approval" from group leads like Coates or Abrams, ensuring centralized oversight of quality and coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:28">[01:52:28]</a>.

In essence, successful [[decision_making_in_product_management | decision-making]] without traditional KPIs either requires strong metric-driven accountability or exceptionally strong, opinionated leadership with a clear, shared [[creating_and_communicating_a_vision | vision]] and taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. Most companies would likely be more successful focusing on trackable metrics in experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

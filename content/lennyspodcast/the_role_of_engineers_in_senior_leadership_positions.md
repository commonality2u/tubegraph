Historically, there has been a tendency to treat engineers "a little bit like children" rather than providing them with the responsibilities necessary to thrive as adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach often involves sheltering engineers from important problems, which is not beneficial for their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Shifting Dynamics and Increased Accountability

In past market eras, particularly during the "zero interest rate era," hiring and retention were paramount, leading to a "coddling" of engineers within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This environment meant that losing team members was a "huge issue" for middle management, which inadvertently led to practices "bad for the engineers, bad for the teams, bad for kind of everyone, bad for efficiency of the organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

However, recent shifts in the market mean that this dynamic is changing. There is now an opportunity to:
*   Treat engineers like peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   Place them into truly senior leadership roles without the "baseline assumption" of needing to coddle them or hide them from "the real problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

The ability to hold engineers accountable is crucial for their career progression into senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. When companies are unwilling to hold engineers accountable due to an excessive focus on retention, it prevents engineers from being placed in senior positions, hindering their growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Developing Engineering Leadership

The shift allows for engineers to be given "real hard problems" and be held accountable, which enables their placement in senior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This is seen as a positive development, offering engineers the opportunity to grow in ways previously hindered by over-protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

Will Larson, a CTO at Carta and author of "Staff Engineer," is releasing a new book, "The Engineering Executive's Primer," aimed at individuals who aspire to be [[engineering_leadership_and_strategy | engineering executives]] or who work with them and seek to better understand or influence their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>. This suggests a growing emphasis on the development and understanding of [[engineering_leadership_and_strategy | leadership roles within engineering]].

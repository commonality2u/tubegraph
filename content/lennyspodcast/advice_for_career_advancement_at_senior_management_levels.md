## Advice for Career Advancement at Senior Management Levels

Advancing from senior management roles (e.g., L7, M1, M2 levels) to executive positions like director or vice president often presents unique [[challenges_and_strategies_for_senior_leaders | challenges]]. While foundational career growth strategies remain relevant, higher levels demand shifts in behavior and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

### Why Senior Managers Get Stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>

Several factors contribute to individuals getting "stuck" at the senior manager level:
*   **Choke Point** There are fewer director or vice president roles compared to senior manager positions, creating a bottleneck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
*   **Economic Conditions** In current economic climates, with organizational flattening and layoffs, there are simply fewer opportunities for promotion as companies run leaner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.
*   **Shift in Leadership Focus** Achieving senior manager status often relies on being highly effective within one's function and excelling at getting things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. However, director and VP roles demand greater emphasis on influence, coordination with other leaders, and delegating details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. The skills that lead to success at one level may not be sufficient for the next, as articulated in Marshall Goldsmith's book, "What Got You Here Won't Get You There" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

### Strategies for Breaking Through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>

While patience is required due to structural limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>, much is within an individual's control to prepare for and secure advancement:

#### 1. Practice Next-Level Skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>
*   **Strategic Thinking** Start working with leadership on strategic projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. This involves thinking in longer terms and at a broader organizational level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   **[[Invention and innovation in career advancement | Inventiveness]]** Become more of an inventor. This doesn't mean creating entirely new concepts but often combining existing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. Dedicate specific, uninterrupted time (e.g., two hours once a month) to focused thinking on problems in your area of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. The goal is not quantity of ideas but quality, as one good idea can take years to fully express <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. [[Invention and innovation in career advancement | Invention]] also encompasses iterative optimization and incremental improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

#### 2. The "Magic Loop" for [[Navigating career growth and advancement in tech | Career Growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
This five-step process, while applicable broadly, takes on an "advanced mode" at senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>:

1.  **Do Your Current Job Well** Ensure your manager perceives you as a solid performer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
2.  **Ask Your Boss How You Can Help** This sets you apart and builds a relationship, showing you're part of their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
3.  **Do What They Ask** Follow through on commitments, even if the task isn't your favorite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
4.  **Propose Helping Them While Meeting Your Goals** This is where the "magic" happens. Managers help those who help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Clearly articulate your goals (e.g., a specific skill, a new role, a promotion, a raise) and inquire how you can assist your manager in a way that also aligns with your aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. At senior levels, this evolves from asking "how can I help" to suggesting actions, and eventually to simply taking action and keeping your leader informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
5.  **Repeat** Continuously loop through these steps, building trust and partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

The "Magic Loop" works because managers often feel overwhelmed and rarely receive offers of help; an ally is a huge asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>. It leverages the "you help me, I'll help you" dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>. This approach directly addresses the implicit gaps preventing promotion and ensures your manager understands your career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:30">[02:00:30]</a>.

#### 3. Demonstrate the "Job Before You Have the Job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>
Proving you can perform the responsibilities of the next level before officially being promoted builds confidence in leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. Leaders want capable direct reports who can take on more of their responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.

#### 4. Become the "Chosen" Person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>
In competitive environments, position yourself as the obvious choice for promotion. This can be critical when organizational changes or reductions occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

### Learning from Failure: The Jeff Bezos Example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>

A significant failure (e.g., a major product launch issue with high-level visibility) can be a turning point, but it doesn't have to be career-ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>. Key takeaways from navigating such a situation:
*   **Own It** Take immediate ownership of the problem and your role in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.
*   **Proactive Communication** Provide frequent, concise updates on the situation, the plan, and next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. This rebuilds trust incrementally and prevents micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
*   **Face the Music** Address difficult conversations in person. It's harder for people to maintain anger or aggressive communication face-to-face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.
*   **Work Hard and Fast** Demonstrate commitment by pulling out all stops to fix the problem, even if it's uncomfortable or outside regular hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
*   **Learn and Adapt** Identify the root cause of the mistake and adjust your approach. For example, moving from "surprise launches" to extensive beta testing to avoid public failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>. Cultivate a "Fear The New York Times headline" mindset, especially at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.
*   **Support Your Team** Recognize the human impact of errors, especially on those directly responsible. Offer reassurance and support to junior team members who may feel undue responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.
*   **Resilience** Overcome feelings of shame or imposter syndrome. Acknowledge the mistake, but be bullheaded enough to move forward and re-earn trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.

### Key [[Leadership Principles and career success | Leadership Principles]] for Success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>

*   **Ownership** Leaders are owners. This means taking responsibility beyond your immediate tasks, embodying the principle: "an owner never says that's not my job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. Owners look for problems and solve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
*   **Bias for Action** Speed matters in business. Many decisions are reversible, so it's often more important to move quickly than to wait for perfect certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Leaders Are Right, A Lot** While this principle acknowledges the need for good judgment, its evolution emphasizes the importance of leaders actively seeking diverse perspectives and working to disconfirm their own beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. This ensures decisions are well-rounded and suitable for a broad customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>.

Ultimately, [[leadership_and_career_advancement | career advancement]] at senior levels hinges on a combination of strategic action, building strong relationships, continuous self-improvement, and a resilient mindset.

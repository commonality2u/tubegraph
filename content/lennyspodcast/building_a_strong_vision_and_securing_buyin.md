Mahika Kapor, a design engineering PM hybrid at Figma, is recognized as the go-to person for leading new "0 to 1" products [00:55:01]. She emphasizes that a product manager's scope should be "the world," with nothing considered out of bounds [00:05:05].

## The Importance of Vision

Mahika believes that vision is "everything" [00:08:12]. A compelling vision that is believed in by the product manager, their team, and the company is crucial [00:08:21]. The product development cycle is often chaotic, with extreme highs and lows [00:08:28]. A strong vision helps anchor the team, preventing discouragement and turning setbacks into learning opportunities [00:08:46]. It ensures that every step feels like forward progress towards a shared future [00:08:55].

## Crafting a Compelling Vision

To craft a compelling vision, a product manager must be "fundamentally inseparable" from both their users and their team [00:09:22]. This involves a "cross-pollination of functions" [00:09:42]:
*   **Research Insights** Understanding user feelings through insights [00:09:55].
*   **Design & Prototypes** Creating beautiful designs and prototypes to communicate the future world [00:10:00].
*   **Engineering & Feasibility** Rooting the vision in what is achievable and can be worked towards [00:10:06].

Instead of a linear process (research to design to engineering), the goal is to foster concurrent, collaborative work [00:10:33]. This convergence of ideas from different places, inspired by *The Medici Effect*, leads to innovation [01:09:05].

## Communicating the Vision and Securing Buy-in

Words alone are often insufficient to communicate a vision [00:11:05]. Figma's culture, which is very detail-oriented and values visual communication, demonstrates this [00:11:12]. A vision pitch should ideally follow a "pain point -> solution -> proof point" structure [00:11:51]. This proof point could be a user testimonial or a mock-up [00:12:06].

Key aspects of communication and buy-in include:
*   **Unified Artifact** The team should create a single artifact (e.g., a Figma deck) together, fostering shared ownership and passion [00:17:09].
*   **Prototypes and Mocks** Lean heavily into designing and prototyping *before* a project receives a green light, allowing stakeholders to "see to believe" and feel an emotional pull towards the idea [00:18:02].
    *   The rise of AI tools is making it easier to build prototypes without extensive design or engineering skills [00:19:55].
*   **Leverage Internal Events** Utilize company hackathons, like Figma's "Maker Week," where the entire company pauses for a week [00:30:30]. This provides an opportunity to gather support for ideas by directly asking colleagues to collaborate [00:20:46]. Even if one's own skills are limited, never let that stop making a pitch [00:21:16].
*   **Embrace Early Visibility** Push the product to gain visibility, even if it's beyond its current development stage, as this generates valuable feedback and early learnings [00:37:18].

## Conviction and Agility

Mahika emphasizes the importance of generating "strong conviction extremely quickly" [00:22:02]. This conviction allows her to navigate the "messy journey from zero to one" [00:22:06].

*   **Building Intuition** Product sense, or intuition, is built through "insatiable curiosity" and constant conversations with users [00:23:38]. These anecdotes create a "repository or library" of conversations to draw from when making decisions [00:24:10].
*   **Opinionated Starting Point** Instead of starting from scratch, a product manager should put forward an "A minus idea" [00:25:51]. People are more likely to react to an idea than to nothing, which either validates the idea or guides it in a better direction [00:25:25].
*   **Strong Opinions, Weakly Held** While conviction is vital, it's equally important to be willing to "kill your darlings" if external signals or user feedback suggest a different path [00:26:22]. Agility is key [00:26:32].
*   **Direct Communication** Mahika advocates for a very direct communication style, explicitly stating her level of confidence in an opinion (e.g., "medium confidence") [00:27:53]. This creates a culture where everyone feels comfortable sharing their opinions and pushing back [00:29:18]. Directness is only effective if it's two-way [00:30:09].

## The Role of Hype and Momentum

When spearheading a product, it's crucial to have a pulse on how everyone is feeling about it [00:33:41]. Generating hype is about getting people to see what the PM sees [00:36:44].

*   **Internal Hype** Leverage large internal forums like sales kickoffs or company-wide showcases to create a "moment" for the product [00:36:55]. An unexpected demo can spark significant excitement [00:36:22].
*   **External Hype** Engage users in milestone moments, turning product anniversaries into "birthday parties" with new feature rollouts and "Easter egg hunts" [00:39:56]. Hype is tied to emotion; users should feel the product was built "for me" [00:41:17]. Understanding a product's unique "brand of delight" helps in generating tailored hype [00:41:49].
*   **PM as Keeper of the Flame** A zero-to-one project is like a flame that needs constant tending. The PM acts as "The Keeper of the Hearth," stoking embers when they're at risk and ensuring the idea spreads like wildfire to create demand [01:19:08].

## User Empathy and Insights

Deep immersion in the user base is critical [00:42:26]. This involves:
*   **Constant Conversations** Regularly talking to users, even grilling friends who work in tech [00:23:41].
*   **Learning from Non-Users** Critically, also ask non-users why they *aren't* using the product [00:44:38]. These conversations can provide the most insightful feedback and lead to new features, such as the placeholder experience in FigJam that helped non-designers [00:45:18].
*   **Leveraging Sales Teams** For products outside the immediate user group, building a tight relationship with the [[building_a_sales_team | sales team]] and joining sales calls is important to understand customer pain points and cross-pollinate into the product roadmap [00:46:41].
*   **Operationalizing Feedback** Insights can inform product roadmap prioritization [00:49:30] and create artifacts for the sales team to evangelize [00:49:38]. For non-immediately actionable feedback, tools like Slack integrations that convert feedback into tasks in a backlog can be used for weekly grooming [00:50:28].

## Passion and Intentionality

Mahika's deep care for her work is evident [00:51:34]. When two people disagree on product strategy, it's often due to different underlying assumptions [00:52:50]. Therefore, it's crucial to understand the assumptions behind top-down strategies and ensure others share the same assumptions when pushing bottom-up ideas [00:53:20]. The more a PM believes in an idea, the more natural it is to be passionate [00:53:58].

If a PM isn't passionate about their current project, they should broaden their scope beyond what's "in flight" [00:54:32]. Their scope should be "the world" [00:55:01]. It's possible to "found something" within an existing company (an "internal startup") or from scratch [00:55:30]. Founding internally offers distribution, technical, or platform advantages, and less risk, but can be slower and require more buy-in [00:55:40].

## Dealing with Change and Fostering an Entrepreneurial Culture

Mahika excels at navigating change and pivots with "grace and enthusiasm" [01:15:07]. This involves a "high agency" approach, actively making things happen [01:12:00].

*   **Entrepreneurial Culture** For a company to remain competitive, it must stay entrepreneurial [01:16:39]. Figma's "run with it" value encourages individuals to sprint in new directions, viewing it as a manifestation of company values rather than a distraction [01:17:04]. Many of Figma's major launches originated from hackathons and bottom-up projects [01:17:28].
*   **Adaptability in the Face of Setbacks** As exemplified by Mahika's experience founding Design Nation, an organization to democratize design education, being adaptable when formal backing falls through is vital [01:09:55]. This means pivoting focus (e.g., from speakers to fundraising) and being "scrappy" [01:11:17].
*   **Embrace Early Dogfooding/Staging** Figma's multi-month staging process helps mature products by gathering extensive feedback from across the company [01:27:10]. This not only provides direct feedback but also makes people "invested" in the product, fostering a sense of ownership because they've shaped it [01:28:14]. This [[building_a_highperformance_team | team sport]] approach elevates product quality [01:28:55].
*   **Share Insights Widely** If a PM has a unique insight, they should "shout from the rooftops" about it [01:29:44]. This fosters an entrepreneurial culture by inspiring others to contribute [01:29:51].
*   **Understand Team Motivations** Understanding individual motivations within a product team (engineers, designers, researchers, data scientists) is key to running a team successfully [01:30:09]. Some prefer solutions handed to them, others want to contribute to the vision [01:30:32]. Asking directly how much they want to be involved and making decisions in the open (even with a leading point of view) empowers the team [01:31:21]. This ensures the team is well-rounded, even if individuals are "spiky" in their skills [01:16:02].

Shas Doshi, in a live podcast recording, reflects on his career as a product leader and shares crucial questions he wished he had asked himself sooner to improve his effectiveness and reduce frustration. These questions highlight the profound impact of [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | strategy]] and [[strategies_for_effective_decisionmaking | decision-making]] on [[product_leadership_and_management_techniques | product leadership]] and overall job satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Why Product Leaders Are So Busy

A common issue for product leaders is persistent busyness and stress, often leading to dissatisfaction despite working hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. While common productivity tips and frameworks are helpful, they eventually meet an "immovable force": scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. As a product career progresses, scope expands to a point where no amount of efficiency can mitigate the busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### The Problem with Annual Planning
Annual planning often consumes several months for senior product leaders, involving numerous spreadsheets, meetings, and stakeholder discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This intensive process often yields plans that are quickly forgotten or rendered irrelevant by customer escalations, necessitating constant revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The common adage, "plans are useless but planning is everything," often serves to justify this ineffective cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### The Strategic Solution
Shas Doshi discovered that having a real, well-aligned [[strategies_for_setting_and_deploying_effective_product_strategies | product strategy]] can drastically reduce the time spent on planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. At Stripe, a clear product strategy for a major product allowed him to complete annual planning in just three days, in contrast to the typical four to six weeks his peers spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This approach minimizes time spent on non-strategic activities, such as debating minor resource allocations, and redirects focus to higher-leverage activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

> "If you have a real product strategy, a real one that everybody is aligned with, that you have got pre-alignment on, then a lot of this nonsense we tend to do with annual planning actually goes away." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>

## Making Good Product Decisions

Another reason for busyness and frustration stems from poor product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Often, decisions are made quickly without clear consideration of customer motivation, differentiation, or distribution, sometimes justified by concepts like "two-way doors" (reversible decisions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

### The Cost of "Two-Way Doors"
In reality, many decisions that appear to be two-way doors are, for a PM leader, effectively one-way doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Committing to a feature without deep thought can lead to a cycle of building, launching, and then having to sign up for even more work to "full-feature" it when it lacks adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. This accumulation of features and debt contributes significantly to busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

> "Frankly, most doors that look like two-way doors are actually one-way doors. They are two-way doors at Bezos's level, but as a PM leader for you, they are one-way door and that's what's making you busy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>

### The Importance of Pausing
A key tactical tip is to pause for minutes, days, or even weeks before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Thinking is cheap and should precede execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

## Do You Actually Have Good Taste?

Shas Doshi challenged himself on whether he had "good taste," extending beyond product design to the fundamental beliefs and evaluation processes of a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

### Execution vs. Strategy
Early in his career at Google, Doshi was in an environment where "strategy is for MBAs," and [[the_importance_of_execution_over_strategy | execution was everything]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This belief persisted until his time at Twitter post-IPO, where despite incredible assets, the company's product struggled due to a lack of a compelling, cohesive product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. This realization led him to understand the critical importance of a clear strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

### Defining "Taste" Beyond Pixels
"Taste" isn't just about beautiful pixels or perfect products; it's about the ability to identify what is truly good *without needing to see its results* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:53">[02:29:53]</a>. It's "game recognize game *before the game is called*" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

### Shedding Biases for Critical Thinking
Product leaders often fall prey to cognitive biases, becoming impressed by:
*   **Catchy metaphors** (e.g., "two-way doors" over "reversible/irreversible decisions") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   **Authority bias** (e.g., believing something because a prominent figure said it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   **Alliterations** (e.g., "fail fast" versus "fail quickly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **Complicated charts and math they don't understand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

To become a more critical thinker and develop better taste, it's essential to shed these patterns and evaluate ideas separately from their social or authority proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. This forms the basis for [[advice_for_improving_strategic_thinking_in_product_managers | improving strategic thinking]].

## Why Does My Job Feel So Frustrating?

Product leadership can be a lonely and frustrating job, despite the overall love for the macro aspects of the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. This frustration often arises when leaders behave in misalignment with their "superpowers" and core preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.

### Operating Levels of Product Work
Product work can be categorized into three levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>:
1.  **Impact Level**: Focusing on the overall impact and strategic direction.
2.  **Execution Level**: Concentrating on the day-to-day implementation and delivery.
3.  **Optics Level**: Managing perceptions, reporting, and external communication.

Frustration arises when a leader is forced to operate predominantly at a level that is not their preferred or "happy place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. As one climbs the corporate ladder, there's often an increasing expectation to spend time on Optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

### Aligning with Your Superpowers
The solution lies in identifying one's superpowers and aligning career decisions with them, rather than succumbing to external expectations or "LinkedIn envy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. By working in accordance with one's true self, product leaders can achieve their best work, love their jobs, and avoid persistent frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

## Am I Really Listening?

A bonus question for [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | world-class leadership]] is: "Am I really listening?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. True listening goes beyond basic active listening techniques (recapping, eye contact) to an entirely different level of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. Resources for deeper listening can be found in the works of Rick Rubin, Dee Hock, and Peter Drucker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

Whiz, a rapidly scaling software company, achieved an astonishing $100 million ARR just 18 months after its founding, making it the fastest-growing software company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:40">[01:31:40]</a>. This article explores the [[effective_team_building_and_leadership_in_startups | leadership]] and team dynamics that contributed to Whiz's explosive growth, as shared by Ros Herberg, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) and VP of Product Strategy at Whiz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

## Early Challenges and Achieving Product-Market Fit

When Ros Herberg joined Whiz as the first product manager, the company, then named Beyond Networks, did not yet have a solidified idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The initial concept for network security proved incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Six weeks after Ros joined, the company underwent a significant pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### The Pivotal "I Don't Understand" Moment

In the early weeks, the team engaged in 10-15 meetings daily with potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, presenting their idea through a deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. Despite customers saying, "sounds interesting," Ros, as the product manager, still didn't understand what they were building after weeks of calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This confusion led her to question the direction, triggering a deep discussion that ultimately led to a pivot towards cloud security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.

Ros initially believed she was the only one confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>, highlighting the importance of [[authenticity_and_leadership_in_tech | vulnerability]] and courage in asking "I don't understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>. This open dialogue is crucial for [[cultural_practices_in_rapidly_scaling_companies | effective team building and leadership in startups]], as people tend to offer positive reinforcement rather than critical feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. Whiz's [[building_and_scaling_a_companys_culture | culture]] of allowing voices to be heard, regardless of seniority, enabled this critical self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.

### Signals of Product-Market Fit

Once the pivot to cloud security occurred, the team observed a distinct shift in customer conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. Instead of vague interest, customers began asking specific questions like:
*   "How are you pricing this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>
*   "When can we start doing a PO?" (Proof of Value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>
*   Offering to connect the team to other relevant contacts within their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>

These were strong indications of "pull" from the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>, where customers showed intense interest and commitment, even filling out complicated questionnaires for a POV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. This "pull" dynamic is essential for [[challenges_and_strategies_in_earlystage_startup_growth | early-stage startup growth]], ensuring genuine customer commitment to the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### The Founding Team and Early Sales

Whiz's founding team, including CEO Assaf Rappaport, previously led security products at Microsoft, such as Azure Sentinel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This highly technical and respected group started Whiz during the March 2020 pandemic lockdown, which ironically became an advantage for conducting numerous customer calls as everyone was home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

Unconventionally, the founders themselves, including Ros, handled early sales and closed deals, even before hiring their first salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. This hands-on approach allowed them to deeply understand the selling process and instill confidence when bringing on dedicated sales staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Ros emphasizes that if the core group cannot achieve something, it's unlikely an external hire will solve the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This practical experience is crucial for [[working_with_sales_in_a_productled_growth_company | effective working relationships with sales]] as the company scales.

## Ros Herberg's Journey: From Product to Marketing Leader

Ros's career path is non-traditional, moving from engineering to product management and then to marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. She joined Whiz by following "good people" rather than a set career plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### The "Heat" Metaphor

Ros describes the shifting "heat" or primary focus within a rapidly growing company:
*   **Early days**: Heat is in the product kitchen, waiting for something tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **Post-product-market fit**: Heat moves to engineering to build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Initial sales**: Heat moves to sales to close deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Scaling**: Heat moves to marketing as sales needs more pipeline and brand awareness becomes critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

Around two and a half years into Whiz, despite strong product-market fit and a functioning sales team, Whiz faced an awareness challenge; customers were signing with competitors before even hearing about Whiz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This prompted Whiz's CEO to ask Ros to lead marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Initially hesitant due to her lack of marketing experience and knowledge of concepts like "leads" or "pipeline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, she spent a weekend learning from podcasts and CMOS before accepting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

She recognized that for a product to scale, brand becomes immensely important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This move exemplifies [[leadership_and_personal_growth_as_a_ceo | leadership and personal growth]] by embracing a challenging new role where she lacked traditional experience.

### Marketing Philosophy: Risk-Taking and Directness

Ros's approach to marketing is untraditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. She believes marketing has less inherent "cost" for mistakes compared to product development, where adding a feature is a long-term commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. In marketing, a failed campaign can simply be discarded, allowing for constant experimentation and noise-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

An example of this risk-taking was transforming Whiz's RSA conference booth from a typical "red and black cyber booth" to a "Wiz of Oz" themed booth with actors and a positive, optimistic brand aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This unconventional strategy dramatically increased booth visitors and set a trend in the cybersecurity industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

Ros attributes her success as CMO to:
*   **Deep Trust with Founders**: Essential for taking risks, especially when the CMO is representing the company's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding the Product and Audience**: Coming from a security background, Ros innately understood Whiz's customers and their needs, which is often a challenge for external CMOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:24]</a>.

### Insights for Product Leaders from a Marketing Lens

Ros highlights a critical gap between product and marketing:
*   **Clarity of Communication**: Product teams, living "inside the bubble" of technical detail, often use jargon or fuzzy language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. Marketing, especially as a company scales, needs crystal-clear, black-and-white messaging to avoid losing meaning in translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **"Dummy Explanation"**: Ros insists that all communications should be understandable by anyone, without assuming deep knowledge of Whiz or the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. For example, using "Cloud security solution" instead of technical acronyms like "CNAPP" which people don't Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This daily reminder to step outside the "Whiz bubble" is a constant challenge for [[leadership_and_communication_in_tech | effective communication]].

## Whiz's Culture and Leadership Principles

Whiz's [[cultural_practices_in_rapidly_scaling_companies | culture]] is defined by a very [[effective_team_building_and_leadership_in_startups | flat organization]] where seniority is less important than driving impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. The four co-founders have worked together for over 20 years, building complete trust and clear domain ownership, which allows for extremely fast decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

Key aspects of Whiz's [[building_and_scaling_a_companys_culture | company culture]] include:
*   **Openness**: Employees are encouraged to question and challenge, as exemplified by Ros's "I don't understand" moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Trust and Opportunity**: Founders give employees trust and opportunities to make an impact, regardless of title, fostering loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing Failure**: Ros's personal philosophy, shaped by her upbringing, is to be "okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail at something and still attempting it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. This mindset, where friction is seen as good, empowers individuals to try new things and push their limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This relates to overcoming "imposter syndrome" by accepting that one might be an imposter in a new role, but it shouldn't deter effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Simplicity**: A core motto is that if something feels too complex—whether a product feature or a life problem—it's likely not the right solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. Taking a step back to find a simpler path is often the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.

## The Future of Whiz

Despite rumored multi-billion dollar acquisition offers, Whiz has chosen to remain independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. The team believes Whiz can become one of the biggest security companies globally by leveraging its leadership in the rapidly growing cloud security market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. Ros emphasizes that in security, being the recognized leader is crucial, making brand even more vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. With over 1,500 employees, Whiz continues to hire across all domains, seeking passionate individuals eager to make an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.

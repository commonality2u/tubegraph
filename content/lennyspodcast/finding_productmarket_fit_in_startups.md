Whiz, a cloud security company, achieved remarkable growth, hitting $100 million ARR in just 18 months, making it the fastest-growing software company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Despite this success, the team initially struggled to find their core idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Ros Hershberg, Chief Marketing Officer and VP of Product Strategy at Whiz, shares insights from their journey, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the right signals and embracing a culture of vulnerability and experimentation.

## The Early Search for [[product_market_fit_strategies | Product-Market Fit]]

When Ros Hershberg joined Whiz as the first product manager, it was originally founded as "Beyond Networks" with an idea in network security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Despite the founding team's strong background in cloud security from Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>, they initially pursued network security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

During this early phase, the team engaged in extensive customer discovery, holding 10 to 15 meetings daily with potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. These meetings involved presenting their idea, which often elicited responses like "Oh, it sounds interesting" or "Would love to hear more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

However, Ros, as the first product manager, found herself confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Despite the positive affirmations, she didn't understand what they were truly going to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

> "I still did not exactly understand what we were going to build, which was confusing because I was a product manager so I was supposed to you know like start building it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>

This confusion led to a critical realization: customers weren't incentivized to deeply critique their broad story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. The team had a natural human bias to look for affirmation rather than listening for what they didn't want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

### The Pivot

Ros's moment of vulnerability, asking "what exactly are we doing here?" led to a deep discussion among the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. This pivotal conversation, lasting about five hours, resulted in the decision to pivot to cloud security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. This was a challenging move as they felt they were leaving their comfort zone, even though cloud security was their background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.

## Recognizing True [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | Product-Market Fit]]

The shift to cloud security brought about a distinct change in customer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>. Instead of vague interest, conversations immediately became enthusiastic and actionable:

> "Suddenly the call sounded like wait, again how are you pricing this? How much will this cost? Or wait like when can we start doing a PO? How long is a PO? Or somebody would like finish the call and be like, okay I know exactly who I need to connect you to in my team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>

These were "really strong indications" of genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. Ros highlights the difference between polite interest and real "pull" from the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. An example shared is a Fortune 10 company, despite being given a long list of technical questions to answer for a Proof of Value (POV), returned it filled out the very next day, demonstrating their strong commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.

This phase underscored key lessons:
*   **When it works, you know it works:** The atmosphere in the calls felt "so different" after the pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.
*   **Don't be afraid to demand commitment:** Asking customers to put in effort (like answering detailed questionnaires) reveals their true desire for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. This ensures mutual commitment, especially when the product is still in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>.

### Founders as Initial Salespeople

Wiz's rapid growth meant they were "always being behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>. The founders, including Ros, closed the first few million in ARR themselves before hiring a sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. This provided invaluable learning and instilled confidence when they eventually hired their first salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.

> "If you can't do it one time and to end then you like the core core Core Group the chances of just bringing somebody from the outside to solve that problem it's wishful in some ways but it never ends up that way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>

## Ros Hershberg's Journey to CMO

Ros's career path from engineer to product manager, and then to Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) and VP of Product Strategy at Whiz, is unconventional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. She admits she never had a career plan, simply following "good people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

After two and a half years at Whiz, despite clear [[product_market_fit_strategies | product-market fit]] and a functioning sales team, awareness remained a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Customers were signing with competitors because they hadn't heard of Whiz in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Recognizing this gap, Whiz's CEO, Assaf, asked Ros to lead marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### The "Heat" Metaphor

Ros describes the shifting "heat" within a growing organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>:
*   **Early Days:** Heat is in the product kitchen, waiting for something to be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Next:** Heat moves to engineering to build the product that customers want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   **Then:** Heat shifts to sales as deals are closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Finally:** As the company scales, the heat moves to marketing to generate more pipeline and build brand awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

She embraced the marketing role because she believed it was essential for scale, emphasizing that "brand matters a lot" even for complex B2B products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Marketing Philosophy for Startups

Ros's approach to marketing is non-traditional, stemming from her deep understanding of the problem Whiz solves and their target audience in the security space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### Product vs. Marketing: A Different Risk Profile

Ros observes a fundamental difference in risk between product and marketing:
*   **Product:** Building a feature takes valuable engineering time and is hard to remove, creating a "huge cost" for mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. "Less is more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Marketing:** There is "no cost to anything, no maintenance, no technical depth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. If a campaign fails, you simply try something different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. This allows for extensive experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

This philosophy translated into a strategy of "making a lot of noise" and "trying everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

#### The Wiz of Oz Booth

A prime example was transforming Whiz's booth at RSA, a major security conference, into a "Whiz of Oz" theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. This starkly contrasted with the typical "red and black" cyber security booths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Their goal was simply to make people stop and ask, "What is Whiz?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This bold move, which Ros was "so scared" would fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>, resulted in five times more visitors than the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This "make noise" approach helped Whiz in [[building_a_brand_for_startups | building a brand]].

### Embracing Vulnerability and Failure

Ros highlights her personal journey of being okay with failing and trying things even when unsure of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. This comes from a childhood upbringing that emphasized "friction is good" and pushing beyond comfort zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

> "I just know that I'm kind of okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail at something and still attempting it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>
>
> "Maybe they will find out your random poster, maybe let them find out like it's fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>

This willingness to try, even if it means being an "imposter" in a new role, is seen as empowering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

### The "Dummy Explanation"

From her marketing perspective, Ros realized the "criticality of marketing and even of product marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Product people, immersed in technical details, often operate in a "bubble," making assumptions about their audience's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

> "If you're on the product side, you can often kind of work with things that are like uh fluffy or blurry or like gray... it doesn't have to be crystal clear because you can kind of go around things. In a way that when you try to scale your message, you can't, like it gets lost in translation. You have to be crystal clear black and white." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>

The "dummy explanation" concept means ensuring everything communicated about the product is understandable by *anyone*, not just industry insiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This involves avoiding jargon and complex terminology, constantly reminding oneself that customers don't live in the company's "bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

## Wiz Culture and Growth

Whiz's four co-founders have a unique history, having worked together for over 20 years across multiple companies and even the Israeli army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. This long-standing relationship fosters "complete trust" and clear domain ownership, leading to fast decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

Whiz maintains a "very flat organization" and an "open culture" where employees can drive impact regardless of title or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. This commitment to giving opportunities builds strong employee loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

Whiz's success stems from addressing the "biggest growing market of security: Cloud security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. Despite its growth, the cloud market is still only 15-20% of total infrastructure, indicating massive future opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>. As a leader in this new space, Whiz is focused on continuing its independent path to become one of the world's biggest security companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.

As of the recording, Whiz has approximately 1,500 employees and is continuously hiring across all domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

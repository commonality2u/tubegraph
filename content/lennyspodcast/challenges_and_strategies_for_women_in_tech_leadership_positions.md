Amy Vora, Chief Product Officer at Fair and former Facebook and WhatsApp product leader, shares insights on navigating the tech industry as a woman, emphasizing authenticity, continuous growth, and strategic self-management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

## Embracing Imperfection and Authenticity
Vora aims to demonstrate that individuals can be "pretty messy and imperfect at times yet still be very successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. She reflects on her early career where successful women often appeared as "super women" who had everything figured out, making her feel like success was unattainable due to her own imperfections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. She openly shares that she currently works from her bathroom at home due to family needs, illustrating that "no one's got it fully figured out" and "most of us are winging it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

## Navigating Feedback and Self-Perception
Vora highlights a significant challenge she faced: receiving feedback like "you could be the smartest person in the room but it doesn't matter if people don't like you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. This led her to consciously "shrink herself" and adopt an "unobjectionable" demeanor to be more "likable," even choosing to wear earth tones for two years to "fade back a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. However, she later realized that as a leader, her team needed her to have strong opinions and be visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

### Strategies for Interpreting Feedback
Women in tech often receive feedback that is more personal and style-focused rather than content-related, creating a "very narrow tightrope" to walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. This feedback can be contradictory, urging one to be "more directive" and "move faster" while also advising to be "less directive" and "move less fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

Vora's advice for interpreting such feedback includes:
*   **Expanding your toolsets:** Instead of making oneself smaller, build new approaches and skills ("new keys to unlock new different kinds of doors") to work effectively with a broader range of people and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.
*   **Choosing how to respond:** Understand that receiving feedback doesn't mean immediate action on all of it. One can choose to seek themes, act in different ways, or simply acknowledge the trade-offs of one's operating style while providing more context to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

## Redefining Support Systems
Vora offers a "hot take" on traditional advice for women: telling them to find mentors and sponsors can be "another set of hoops" and "another burden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. She emphasizes that while she benefited from the "extreme generosity" of many leaders, she didn't have a single mentor, and the focus on finding one often adds unnecessary pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

## Advice for Young Women in Product
For young women starting in product, Vora stresses:
*   **Be your authentic self:** "Don't dampen who you are and your strengths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous expansion:** Whenever a problem arises, "just add more to the things that you can do, the tools that you have, the way you can express yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.
*   **Never shrink yourself:** This is a crucial principle for growth and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

## The Role of Curiosity and Ego Sublimation
Vora highlights that a key skill is to embrace curiosity, especially during disagreements. Drawing from a quote by Meta's CTO, Vora adopted the response "fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This approach allowed her to learn more and consistently reach better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. She recognized that her desire "to be right" was less important than achieving the best outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This involves "sublimating your ego a little bit" and recognizing that diverse perspectives provide valuable information one might not possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## Balancing Strategy and Execution
While strategy is "glamorous" and "fun," Vora emphasizes that [[challenges_and_strategies_for_senior_leaders | execution eats strategy for breakfast]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:56:00">[37:56:00]</a>. Customers ultimately care about the product in their hands, not theoretical plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a>. A perfect strategy with poor execution yields no learning, whereas a good-enough strategy with perfect execution allows for continuous iteration and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:24:00">[39:24:00]</a>. Even at senior levels, a significant amount of time should still be spent on ensuring products reach the market, unblocking teams, and continually improving the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>.

## Building Confidence in Strategic Thinking
Vora's personal [[navigating_career_growth_and_advancement_in_tech | career growth]] involved overcoming a lack of confidence in declaring strategy, feeling that she didn't know enough to predict the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>. To build this confidence, she found it helpful to:
*   **Talk to customers:** Gaining unique knowledge of customer needs and being able to "build an emulator" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:32:00">[46:32:00]</a>.
*   **Work through product iterations:** Visualizing how different outcomes would look from a product portfolio perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:55:00">[46:55:00]</a>.
*   **Gather diverse opinions:** Polling leadership teams on future predictions to identify areas of agreement or necessary discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:12:00">[47:12:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace adaptability:** Being comfortable that strategies can change and that the "execution machine" will allow for iteration based on customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:44:00">[47:44:00]</a>.

## Understanding Senior Leadership Challenges
As one becomes more senior, the problems encountered are "fundamentally unsolvable" by simple means, meaning decisions are often about choosing the "least bad" or "suboptimal" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>. It's crucial to acknowledge these "hard truths" to avoid feeling like a failure; instead, it's a normal part of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>. This perspective can help Individual Contributors (ICs) understand the complexities faced by senior leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to consistently focus on the customer, which provides a shortcut to success and personal satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. While short-term business metrics might diverge from direct customer value, in the long term, "it is very rare for customer value to be different than company value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.

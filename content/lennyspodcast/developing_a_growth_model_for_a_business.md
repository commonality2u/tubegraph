A growth model is an analytical representation of how a business grows, typically built in a spreadsheet, which forces a deep understanding of the business's mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. It serves as a formula for the business, summarizing the factors that drive its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Utility of a Growth Model

A growth model is valuable in many contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>:
*   **Deep Understanding**: Building the model forces a comprehensive understanding of how the business works, as it's difficult to fake when calculations must align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Assessment**: It helps in weighing different opportunities and understanding the potential benefits of working on various initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Resource Allocation**: It provides a "common currency" to compare and trade off the efforts of different teams, aiding in strategic allocation of product and growth resources during quarterly or annual planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Strategic Insight**: It clarifies which levers are most important for business growth, revealing, for instance, that retention often has a disproportionately large impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

It is important to note that a growth model is not a forecasting tool and will not replace what a finance team builds to project the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Building a Growth Model

The process of building a growth model is often "painful" but highly valuable, as it forces learning from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. It's recommended to partner with a smart analyst or finance person to start building and iterating on the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

### Basic Building Blocks
The simplest growth models, applicable to most businesses, comprise three core components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>:

1.  **Acquisition Channels**: Understanding where traffic comes from, including assumptions around traffic, spend, and conversion rates for paid marketing, sales, or viral referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
2.  **Retention**: Modeling the rate at which customers activate and their monthly retention curve, or how long they stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
3.  **Monetization**: How customers generate revenue, such as monthly or annual fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

These components can be thought of as a linear flow: acquiring customers, who then activate, retain, and generate contribution margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### Layering Complexity
As a business evolves, additional layers of complexity are added to the model:

*   **Transactional Business**: For businesses with transactions, it's necessary to add how retained customers transact (e.g., transactions per month, average order value) and unit economics due to higher costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Marketplace Business**: In addition to demand-side modeling, a marketplace requires modeling supply acquisition and retention, and understanding how these two sides interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   **Dual-Sided ROI Equations**: Instead of solely focusing on "Marketplace balance," it's crucial to build ROI equations for acquiring both supply and demand that fully internalize the marketplace dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>. For example, the cost to acquire a rider for Uber should include the cost to acquire the necessary drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.

### Non-Linear Relationships
The models become more interesting when non-linear relationships are introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>:

*   **Virality**: Existing customers referring new ones, with a coefficient impacting business growth speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Paid Marketing Reinvestment**: Linking the contribution margin generated from paid marketing to reinvestment for future growth. This highlights why payback period is a better measure than LTV to CAC for understanding growth speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Challenges and Nuances
Growth models can break down if too many assumptions are stacked, especially in marketplaces where interactions are hard to understand (e.g., how adding supply impacts demand and customer retention) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

*   **Conceptual Models**: A high-level conceptual model describing the entire system is useful to understand important levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Mini-Models**: Each product pod or go-to-market team should have its own "mini-model" to describe their specific piece of the business, understanding the inputs that drive their North Star metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
    *   For [[growth_teams_and_misconceptions | growth teams]], mini-models might focus on managing a funnel (traffic, conversion, retention) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
    *   For teams managing tensions (e.g., Marketplace quality balancing new supply vs. customer experience), models are different, focusing on optimizing the trade-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from Building Growth Models

*   **Retention is Key**: Growth is often much more sensitive to customer retention than initially intuited, as a healthy retained customer base impacts referrals, content generation, and contribution margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Even small percentage gains in retention can be more valuable than larger changes in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
    *   At Thumbtack, the growth model revealed the business was exceptionally sensitive to the repeat rate of new customers, leading to a shift of resources from top-of-funnel optimization to cross-selling and improving the customer journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Product for Retention**: Retention is the culmination of the entire product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. To improve retention, focus on core product levers and the customer experience, rather than just sending more emails or push notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.
*   **Early User Experience (Onboarding)**: The biggest wins in retention often come from improving the early user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. There's a significant opportunity to teach new users about the product's value and prove its utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Identifying and homogenizing inconsistent or bad early experiences (e.g., low hourly rates for new Uber drivers) can significantly improve long-term retention curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Avoid "Resurrection"**: Trying to reactivate churned users is typically less leveraged than focusing on new users, as churned users have already decided not to use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   **Correlation vs. Causation**: Beware of the analytical failure mode of assuming that because "best users do X," making other users do X will drive future retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. These correlational exercises often hold little weight because of underlying unique customer experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

> "I think 50% of the value you get from it is simply building the model. It forces you to understand it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>

By iteratively building and refining a growth model, founders and teams can gain crucial intuition about what truly drives their business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

Many organizations believe their primary issues stem from a lack of training for their people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, 99% of the time, the real problem lies in how goals are set and [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | strategy]] is deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Without clear strategic context, even trained individuals lack direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Establishing a functional [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | product organization]] and its [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | product strategy]] requires a holistic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Common Problems with Product Strategy

One of the most significant issues product teams face, especially in scaling SaaS companies, is the lack of a comprehensive and prioritized strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This often occurs at the pivotal scale-up phase, moving from finding [[strategies_for_achieving_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] to rapid scaling and managing a complex portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Signs that a team or company lacks or is not using its [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | strategy]] include:
*   Teams working excessively long hours (80 hours a week) without moving key metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
*   Product or tech being perceived as a "black box" by the executive team, who question what product teams do all day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
*   A "missing middle" where individual team efforts (e.g., feature enhancements, bug fixes) are not clearly connected to overarching business goals, objectives, or vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   Executives and the board indicating they "don't really know what's going on in tech or product" or if goals are being achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   Different parts of the organization having conflicting or unaligned goals, leading to infighting among stakeholders and executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   Product managers asking "why are we building this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   Strategy existing only in people's heads rather than being explicitly written down and communicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
*   Teams being spread too thin across numerous initiatives, preventing significant movement in business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## The Role of a Chief Product Officer (CPO) in Strategy

A Chief Product Officer (CPO) is typically needed when a company reaches a point of scale where a comprehensive [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | product strategy]] is essential, rather than just rapid execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

Signs it's time to hire a CPO include:
*   The company is moving from a single product to a multi-product portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   The company needs to manage a complex portfolio and scale rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   There's a need to rethink and reprioritize the entire strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   The company is expanding geographically or into drastically new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   A major transformation, pivot, or merger of two companies is occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   The current product leadership isn't providing clear direction to product managers, or there's trouble hiring product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   There is a lack of training paths or implemented processes for junior product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

A CPO's responsibilities extend beyond typical VP or Head of Product roles:
*   They formulate and deploy an all-encompassing [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | product strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   They ensure strong communication between product teams and the executive team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   They understand financials deeply to create revenue projections based on roadmaps and [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | product strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   They can confidently project to the board and act as a "fantastic executive navigator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   They can oversee multiple functions like product, design, product operations, and sometimes analytics or even engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

## Elements of an Effective Strategy

A well-deployed [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | strategy]] ensures that product teams deeply understand how their work impacts the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. Key elements include:

### 1. Clear Vision
A vision should be:
*   **Concrete enough to be pictured:** It cannot be vague or fluffy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.
*   **Lofty and aspirational:** Far enough away that it's not a single build, requiring iteration and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.
*   **Different from today's reality:** It describes who the company wants to be 5-10 years from now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.
*   **Articulate how it will be different:** Beyond just "being the best," it should specify how the company will achieve that, including target customers and value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.
*   **Specify what *not* to do:** A powerful vision also defines what the company will *not* pursue, preventing teams from copying competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

### 2. Strategic Intents
These are big business movers for the next 2-3 years, such as expanding geographically, going up/down market, or innovating into new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. They must be clearly prioritized at the top level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.

### 3. Product Initiatives
These are problem-oriented and meaty challenges to solve for customers, typically made up of multiple epics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

### 4. Solutions/Options (Epics)
These are the tactical solutions built by product teams on the ground floor, working with developers to address product initiatives and ultimately hit strategic intents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

## Communicating and Deploying Strategy

Effective [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | strategy]] deployment relies on clear communication and alignment:
*   **Consistent Storytelling:** All teams should tell a similar story about what they are doing and why, connecting tactical work to business metrics and market entry goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
*   **Written Documentation:** Strategies should be explicitly written down, not just exist in people's heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
    *   CEOs can write two-pagers covering company origin, current state, external threats, competition, what to care/not care about, and prioritized strategic intents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
    *   These can be stored in Google Docs or a wiki, linked together to allow reading up the strategy tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.
*   **Visual Communication:** Combine writing with visual aids like presentations, mock-up prototypes, or ecosystem diagrams, especially for executives who may be more visually oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. Designers can be invaluable in making these clear and impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
*   **Executive Alignment:** Ensure executives are aligned on company goals to foster a cohesive team culture and enable calm, objective trade-off discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   **Clear Priorities:** Well-deployed [[developing_and_implementing_product_strategy | strategy]] makes it easier to manage priorities and push back on work not aligned with overall company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>.

## Overcoming Obstacles to Strategy Deployment

Organizations that struggle with strategy deployment often overestimate the need for training and underestimate issues with goal setting and strategy execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

Key obstacles and solutions:
*   **Lack of Action:** Consultants can provide advice, but the organization must be ready and willing to take action, even if it means drastic changes to people or structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   **Absence of Data:** Leaders often lack the necessary data to set strategy. Hiring data analysts is crucial to gather internal data (financial systems, user analytics) and surface insights to track OKRs and make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>.
*   **Fear of Uncertainty:** Leaders may desire 100% certainty that a strategy will work, but this is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. The key is to make the best-informed decision at the time and be willing to correct course if it proves to be the wrong one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

## Product Operations' Role in Scaling Strategy

As a [[product management | product management]] organization scales, new challenges arise that Product Operations (Product Ops) can address:
*   **Standardization:** Product Ops helps standardize processes and outputs across teams, ensuring consistency in roadmaps, career ladders, and meeting cadences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   **Insight Delivery:** It ensures the right insights (internal data and external customer/market research) reach the teams for informed decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
*   **Streamlining Customer Research:** Product Ops standardizes the approach to customer interactions, preventing multiple teams from bothering the same customers and empowering product managers to conduct research efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.
*   **Strategic Cadence Management:** It helps manage and standardize strategic check-ins, planning sessions, and communication formats with other divisions like sales and product marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

## Advice for Improving Strategic Thinking

To get better at [[advice_for_improving_strategic_thinking_in_product_managers | strategic thinking]] and [[the_importance_of_strategy_and_decisionmaking_in_product_leadership | product leadership]]:
*   **Imagine Being the CPO:** Even if not in a leadership role, pretend to be the CPO and consider what actions you would take to drive the company forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. This provides valuable practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.
*   **Talk to Market and Financial Experts:** Engage with people who deeply understand the market and company financials, such as the CPO, sales, or other departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>. Learn about their thought processes, how they analyze data, and what they consider issues or opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.
*   **Gain Data Exposure:** Product strategy at higher levels heavily relies on market, customer, and financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>. Seek opportunities to work with or understand data analysts and customer research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Focus on Execution and Reflection:** Prioritize doing your job and then analyze what works and what doesn't. Identify specific skill gaps (e.g., user research, data analytics) and deep dive into those areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>.
*   **Iterate and Adapt:** Remember that processes and frameworks are meant to be iterated on and adapted to fit a company's specific culture and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>. Continuously evaluate whether your approach helps you improve as a [[product management | product manager]] and change it if it doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Study Other Companies' Strategies:** Analyze how successful companies formulated and executed their strategies to see diverse approaches and learn how they connected data, market understanding, and customer insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.

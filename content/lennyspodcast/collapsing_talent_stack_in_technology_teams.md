The role of product management, along with design and engineering, is undergoing a rapid transformation due to artificial intelligence (AI), occurring faster than many anticipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This shift suggests that traditional product management, as known today, is "dead" or will be soon, necessitating a pivot for professionals in these fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:5:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The rate of technological change has accelerated dramatically in the last 18 to 24 months, bringing about changes that were previously unimaginable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The "Death" of Traditional Product Management

Product work is becoming less time-consuming and requires less manual thought, potentially making it more enjoyable if teams adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The key is to [[evolving_team_structures_and_management_skills | pivot]] away from old methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Historically, developing a product strategy could take weeks, involving numerous meetings, customer interviews, team feedback rounds, and extensive document revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Now, AI tools like ChatGPT can generate a comprehensive 10-page product strategy document in minutes, serving as a robust first draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Many daily product management tasks can and should be automated:
*   **Drafting documents** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>
*   **Giving and getting passive feedback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
*   **Writing updates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
*   **Creating meeting agendas, summaries, and action items** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>
*   **Prioritizing feature requests** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
*   **Monitoring and creating goals/OKRs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   **Tracking competitors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>
*   **Prepping for interviews and consolidating candidate feedback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>
*   **Telling customer stories** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   **Making slides visually appealing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>
*   **Explaining product functionality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>

By automating these tasks, individuals can save days each week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The goal is not necessarily 100% quality from AI, but rather getting to 75% much faster than starting from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

> [!TIP] **Becoming an AI-Powered Product Team**
> To navigate this change, teams must:
> 1.  **Automate themselves** to speed up delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
> 2.  **Add new skills** and expand their responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
> 3.  **Multiply their impact** by teaching the team how to leverage AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## From Product Triad to Generalist Specialist

AI is predicted to "collapse the talent stack," meaning jobs that were once separate will begin to merge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

Traditionally, technology teams have embraced the "product Triad" model, comprising product, engineering, and design leads, often supported by data teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This model often leads to a "handoff mechanism" where product delivers requirements to design, and design delivers to engineering, limiting individual involvement across the building process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

The future points toward a "generalist specialist" model, where individuals specialize in one area (product, design, or engineering) but are expected to participate across the entire building process and "do the work that needs to get done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This approach is governed by the principle of "no lanes," encouraging individuals to act wherever their skills can advance a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. For example, a product manager might contribute to design, or an engineer might write a Product Requirements Document (PRD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### The AI-Powered Triple Threat

The emergence of the "AI-powered Triple Threat" signifies an individual capable of combining engineering, design, and product skills, often leveraging AI tools, agents, and platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. These individuals might have a primary specialization but need to be proficient across all three domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This shift suggests the traditional Triad structure will diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

> [!NOTE] **Case Study: Cody**
> Cody, a non-traditional product manager with a background in engineering and marketing, used AI (ChatPRD) to learn and perform product management tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. When blocked by design team priorities, he learned to use AI tools (V.D.) to build beautiful designs and prototypes for his product, ultimately even starting to do PRs for frontend code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This demonstrates the breadth of skills and adaptability expected in the new era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

The ability of individuals to move faster than small teams, and small teams faster than large ones, supports the idea that opinionated product leadership within compact teams, equipped with powerful tools, can accelerate progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This new role may also absorb aspects of product marketing and data analysis, making it an "everything" role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## Implications for Product Leaders

Product leaders are also subject to this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. They must prepare to manage these new, dynamic team compositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This includes fostering more commercial and technical skills within teams, as leaders will be expected to manage individuals who code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The shift implies a move toward a "cpto" (Chief Product and Technology Officer) like role, bringing functions together as individual skills converge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

Budgeting will also change, requiring consideration for investments in AI agents and tools alongside headcount, impacting R&D investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. The emphasis will be on "artisanally crafted team topologies," where teams are built specifically for the task at hand, organizing around motivated individuals with diverse, "globular" skill sets rather than rigid, prescriptive structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

## Adapting to the New Era

Personal experience and strategy are becoming commoditized as AI can replicate them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

> [!WARNING] **The NaivetÃ© of Inaction**
> "The only people that need to be worried are the people acting like they don't need to be worried." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>
> Believing "AI will never do this thing" is naive; instead, embrace "AI can help me do anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

Individuals and leaders must:
*   [[generative_skills_in_tech | Skill up]] and build unique value propositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.
*   Focus on [[building_and_managing_a_successful_tech_team | running, building, and scaling AI-powered teams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   Anticipate rapid change and start adapting immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

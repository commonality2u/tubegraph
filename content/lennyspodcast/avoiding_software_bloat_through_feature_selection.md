Linear, a B2B SaaS product, has garnered significant praise for its design, speed, and user experience, standing out in a competitive market often characterized by "bloated" software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:58">[01:21:58]</a>. Nonan You, Head of Product at Linear, explains their deliberate strategy to avoid the common pitfall of software bloat, primarily through rigorous feature selection and an opinionated approach to product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## The Problem of Bloat
The common criticism Linear receives is that it will eventually become a "bloated piece of software" due to the need to check various feature boxes for IT teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Nonan states this is a frequent question from job candidates, who observe the historical trend of startups in this space failing to compete without succumbing to bloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Linear's Core Feature Selection Philosophy
Linear employs a clear policy for feature requests, distinguishing between those that can be debated and those that must be rejected outright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

> "The stuff that we absolutely have to say no to is the exact kind of thing that leads to this bloatedness that makes IC [Individual Contributor] kind of hate their lives." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>

The features they **absolutely say no to** are:
*   Customization features requested by middle managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   Features primarily intended to make reporting easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   Features that come at the cost of worsening the Individual Contributor (IC) workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### Prioritizing the Individual Contributor (IC)
Linear's policy is to prioritize the IC and the user over the buyer or middle manager, especially when it comes to reporting and custom features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. This is considered a "core promise" of Linear: they will not make this particular trade-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

The reasoning behind this strict stance is that if the IC user experience is degraded, they will disengage from the tool. For instance, engineers are paid to write code, and their performance reviews are based on code contributions, not filling out tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. If tickets become tedious with unnecessary custom fields, ICs will fill them sporadically or randomly, leading to inaccurate and unreliable reporting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

> "I think for us it's like it's a very easy decision when it comes to that particular category of feature request." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>

This approach means actively turning down deals that hinge on such customization, relying on a long-term vision that holding the line on user experience will ultimately lead to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Buyers are convinced that the very features they *think* they need are often the cause of their current operational mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

### Identifying Misaligned Incentives
A crucial [[identifying_high_leverage_tasks_for_product_managers | nuance]] in their strategy is to identify where incentives are misaligned within the user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. For example, a middle manager desires detailed reporting, while an IC wishes to avoid extra steps. Product management's role is to find these situations and make judicious trade-offs to achieve win-win outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## Deep Customer Understanding Drives Feature Decisions
Instead of broad customization, Linear focuses on deeply understanding specific user pain points and building native features that address them elegantly.

### From General Requests to Specific Solutions
When customers ask for broad features like "fully customized fields," Linear digs deeper to understand the underlying need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Often, these requests stem from a desire to track customer-specific needs (e.g., "Walmart asked for this feature") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

Linear's solution for this was a "customer requests" feature that automatically links feedback from customer support tools and CRMs, tagging issues with the requesting company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. This eliminates manual tagging by ICs, makes their lives easier, and provides engineers with direct insight into real-life use cases and email communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### The "Anneling" Process
Nonan describes a process called "annealing" for product development, where an initial version of a feature is released, and feedback is gathered. If the feature doesn't quite match reality, it signals an incorrect assumption in the original design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This isn't about volume of feedback but about identifying fundamental mismatches with user reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

For larger, general feature requests, they seek out "concentrated pools" of specific use cases that make sense to adopt as first-order features, solving them exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Building Mental Models
Instead of directly informing what to build, research, data, and customer conversations are used to inform a "mental model" of the user and their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This internal model is continuously updated. Linear maintains a backlog of "product opportunities" – problems to solve or areas to improve – even if they lack full conviction on the approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. They gather understanding over time, periodically re-evaluating their approach based on accumulated insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

For example, "capacity planning" has been in their backlog, observed as a common struggle for managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. While existing solutions are poor (e.g., complex spreadsheets), Linear aims to find a specific, elegant solution that leverages existing data within their tool, rather than trying to solve the entire, vast problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

## B2B Software as a Teacher
Linear views B2B software not just as a problem-solver but as a teacher of "how to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. When a company adopts a tool, they adopt the inherent practices and processes embedded within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

> "When you adopt that tool, you're not just adopting like the actual software, you're adopting the idea that this is a practice that you ought to be doing in the first place." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>

This perspective reinforces Linear's opinionated approach. They find consensus among high-performing teams on effective practices (e.g., managing a triage queue) and then automate these within the tool, providing a "button" for other companies to adopt these "best practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This aligns with [[implementing_technical_and_cultural_practices_for_efficient_software_development | implementing technical and cultural practices for efficient software development]].

The goal is to provide a "baseline level of marketing competency" or operational efficiency, ensuring that the "worst we can do is whatever the tool defaults are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. By limiting customization, Linear ensures users conform to proven, effective workflows, thereby avoiding bloat and improving overall team effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

## Balancing Speed and Quality
Linear's approach to feature selection is intertwined with their belief that there is no inherent trade-off between speed and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Instead, the focus is on competence and rapid iteration. The goal is to get a workable solution that tests a key hypothesis out within 10% of the allotted time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This allows them to quickly validate or invalidate assumptions and avoid wasting time on features nobody wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

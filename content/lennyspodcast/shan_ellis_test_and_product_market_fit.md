The [[stages_of_productmarket_fit | Shaun Ellis Test]], also known as the [[framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | Product Market Fit Test]], is a simple yet profoundly impactful idea in the startup world, designed to help companies understand if they have [[product_market_fit_techniques | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Developed by growth expert Shaun Ellis, who also coined the term "growth hacking," this test is widely used by founders today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## The Shaun Ellis Test Explained

The core of the test lies in a single question: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Respondents are given choices:
*   "Very disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>
*   "Somewhat disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>
*   "Not disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>
*   "Not applicable, I've already stopped using the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>

The goal is to identify the percentage of users who would be "very disappointed" without the product. Historically, products where a "high enough percentage" of users expressed this sentiment performed well, while those with a low percentage tended to struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

### The 40% Threshold
Shaun Ellis observed a pattern across many startups where achieving a 40% or higher response rate for "very disappointed" indicated a strong likelihood of [[framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This threshold emerged from working with numerous Y Combinator companies and sharing the question among startups in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

### Leading Indicator vs. Lagging Indicator
Ellis emphasizes that the test is a [[indicators_and_metrics_for_productmarket_fit_progression | leading indicator]] of [[framework_for_finding_productmarket_fit | product market fit]], not the ultimate proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. The true [[indicators_and_metrics_for_productmarket_fit_progression | lagging indicator]] is whether users actually keep using the product (retention cohorts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. The test's benefit is providing early insight without needing a robust analytics system or waiting for long-term retention data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

## History and Impact

Shaun Ellis is recognized as one of the earliest and most influential thinkers in the growth field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Beyond coining "growth hacking," he developed the ICE prioritization framework, was an early proponent of freemium strategies, and most famously, created the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. His career includes leading growth at Dropbox and Eventbrite, assisting companies like Microsoft and Nubank, and authoring "Hacking Growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

The test's origin stemmed from Ellis's desire to filter customer feedback to focus on those who genuinely cared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. While working at Zne (Inbox spelled backwards), he sought a more "real answer" than traditional satisfaction surveys, especially from senior management, who he perceived as "never satisfied" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Flipping the question to disappointment yielded more honest responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. After Zne, he applied it at Dropbox and other companies, consistently finding it more effective than typical satisfaction questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Using the Test Effectively

### When to Administer the Test
The test is most effective when administered to a random sample of users who have:
*   Actively used the product (not just signed up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>
*   Hit an "activation moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>
*   Used it two or more times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>
*   Used it recently (e.g., within the last week or two), to ensure they haven't churned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>

The minimum recommended sample size for reliable data is 30 responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### Focusing on "Very Disappointed" Users
The most valuable aspect of the test is using it to identify and understand the users who would be "very disappointed" without the product. These are your "must-have" users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Shaun Ellis advises ignoring the "somewhat disappointed" users, as they indicate a "nice to have" product, and focusing on their feedback might dilute the product for your core "must-have" users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

To [[product_market_fit_techniques | deeply understand]] these must-have users, Ellis recommends a follow-up survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>:
1.  **Open-ended question:** "What is the primary benefit that you get?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a> This helps crowdsource different benefits.
2.  **Multiple-choice question:** Based on the common open-ended responses, create a multiple-choice question asking users to select one distinctive benefit statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
3.  **Follow-up "Why" question:** "Why is that benefit important to you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a> This provides crucial context for messaging and understanding user pain points (e.g., "drowning in email" for Zne) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

These insights inform every aspect of the business:
*   **Product Roadmap:** Double down on features important to must-have customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **Onboarding:** Guide new users to the right experience quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.
*   **Messaging:** Set the right expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.
*   **Acquisition Campaigns:** Target users with the specific need your product solves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.
*   **Engagement Loop:** Reinforce how to experience the core benefit more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Adjusting the Threshold
While 40% is a common benchmark, it's not rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. Cultural factors can influence responses (e.g., Brazilians might be "very nice" and show higher scores, while Hungarians might be more "pessimistic" and show lower scores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. The primary purpose of the target is to provide a clear goal for the team, ensuring they don't aggressively grow before achieving a desired level of product market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges and Limitations

### False Positives and "Investment"
Sometimes, high scores on the test, particularly in later-stage products, can be influenced by user "investment" or switching costs rather than pure utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. For example, Webs.com (a website builder) saw 90% "very disappointed" rates because users had invested significant time in building their sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Similarly, Eventbrite's high score reflected organizers' investment in setting up events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. While this is not a "false positive" per se, it indicates a blend of utility and strong lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.

### Inapplicable Products
The test is not suitable for "one-off" products or experiences, such as watching a movie or attending a workshop, where the value proposition doesn't involve ongoing usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. For these, an NPS (Net Promoter Score) question might be more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.

### Small Market Size
Achieving a high "very disappointed" percentage doesn't guarantee a massive business. It simply means you've found a passionate user group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>. It's a strategic decision whether to pursue a niche with intense loyalty or a broader market with slightly less enthusiastic users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>. Ellis generally prefers a more passionate customer base, believing it offers a better chance of long-term success by fostering deep relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

## Improving Product Market Fit (when score is low)

If a product scores low (e.g., 10-15% "very disappointed"), the strategy remains to understand the "must-have" users deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.

Key strategies include:
1.  **Repositioning:** Focus product messaging and onboarding on the core benefit that resonates with the "very disappointed" users. For Lookout, a mobile security company, initially only 7% would be very disappointed. By identifying that these users valued antivirus functionality, the company repositioned the product around antivirus and streamlined onboarding to prioritize this feature. This increased the "very disappointed" score to 40% in two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
2.  **Streamlining Onboarding (Speed to Value):** Make it as easy and fast as possible for users to experience the core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
3.  **[[customer_interactions_and_productmarket_fit | Superhuman's Approach]]:** While Ellis traditionally advises ignoring "somewhat disappointed" users, Superhuman found a way to use their feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50">[41:50]</a>. They identified the primary benefit for their "must-have" users, then asked "somewhat disappointed" users who also valued that benefit what they needed for the product to become a "must-have" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25">[42:25]</a>. This approach allowed them to improve the product without diluting the core experience for their most passionate users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:40">[42:40]</a>.

## Tools and Practicalities

*   **Survey Tools:** While various tools like Qualaroo or Intercom can be used, simple emailed surveys with SurveyMonkey are often sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:20">[36:20]</a>.
*   **Template:** A free template and how-to guide for the survey were made available at `survey.io` (now `pmfsurvey.com`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:34">[43:34]</a>.
*   **Additional Questions:** Include questions like "What would you use instead if this product were no longer available?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:59">[44:59]</a> This helps identify if the product is a commodity (easy alternatives) or truly unique and valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:03">[45:03]</a>.

## Connection to Growth Strategy

Shaun Ellis's philosophy on growth emphasizes sustainable, systemic growth over isolated "hacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50">[45:50]</a>.

His typical approach to helping companies grow, once a good product market fit score is achieved (e.g., 40%+):
1.  **Understand the Value:** Deeply grasp what makes the product a "must-have" for its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47">[48:47]</a>.
2.  **Define a North Star Metric:** Establish a metric that captures "units of value" being delivered to customers (e.g., Airbnb's "Nights Booked," Uber's "Weekly Rides") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50">[49:50]</a>. This metric should be time-capped, up-and-to-the-right over time, and correlate to revenue growth but not be revenue itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
3.  **Optimize the "Value Delivery Engine" (Growth Funnel):**
    *   **Activation (Primary Focus):** This is the most critical stage, as users are at the highest risk of churn before experiencing the core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:00">[0:51:00]</a>. Improving this often involves qualitative research to understand why people drop off, reducing friction, and clearly communicating benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:51">[57:51]</a>. An example is LogMeIn, which saw a 1000% increase in signup-to-usage rate (from 5% to 50%) by dedicating product and marketing teams to improving activation, turning a $10,000/month channel into a $1,000,000/month one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:50">[54:50]</a>.
    *   **Engagement:** Maximize usage within the product's natural cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Facebook's shift from monthly to daily active users as a North Star metric is a prime example of driving engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.
    *   **Referral:** Implement referral programs *only* if there's already strong organic word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. Dropbox's famous referral program was built upon an already passionate user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. Similarly, freemium models only work if the free product is "so good" that it naturally generates word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.
    *   **Revenue Model:** Ensure the business can monetize effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Acquisition (Last Focus):** Aggressively scale customer acquisition channels only after the other elements are efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Prior to this, minimal acquisition is done to maintain flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Identifying potential channels involves talking to customers and asking how they found the product or similar products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>.

## Evolution of Growth

Early in Ellis's career, simply being data-driven in customer acquisition was enough to win, as many marketers focused on less measurable metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Today, competition is high, requiring efficiency across all parts of the business (conversion, retention, monetization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. The biggest [[challenges_of_achieving_productmarket_fit | challenge]] now is driving cross-functional collaboration between marketing, product, sales, and customer success teams, who may not be accustomed to working together on growth initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.

## ICE Framework

Shaun Ellis also developed the ICE prioritization framework (Impact, Confidence, Effort) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. This simple method helps prioritize experiments and ideas by estimating their potential impact, confidence in that impact, and the effort required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>. It aims to simplify decision-making and foster better idea generation across teams by providing a systematic way to compare ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>.

Dharmesh Shah, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot, highlights his excitement for AI, comparing its impact to the arrival of the web in the mid-to-late 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>. He views AI as a significant leap, offering "cognition at scale" and the ability to literally amplify the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

## The Opportunity for Product People
For product professionals, [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | AI]] presents a massive opportunity to reimagine the world, similar to how the internet enabled new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>.

### Shifting from Imperative to Declarative Models
Historically, software products have been described as "intuitive," but in reality, users translate a mental model of their desired outcome into a series of clicks, drags, and other actions within the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>. This represents an "impedance mismatch" or a translation layer that has to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>.

With [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | AI]], the opportunity is to shift from an imperative model (step-by-step instructions for the computer) to a declarative model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:28">[01:34:28]</a>. In a declarative model, users describe the *outcome* they want, not the *steps* to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>. SQL is an analogy for this, where one describes the data needed rather than the code to retrieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:02">[01:35:02]</a>. This enables technology to now allow users to express what's in their head (via text or voice) and the software can pull it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:48">[01:35:48]</a>.

### Lessons from Chatbot Development
Dharmesh Shah previously built a product called GrowthBot six and a half years ago, which was a chatbot for HubSpot and business software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>. While the idea was well-conceived, the technology for it "didn't work really well" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:20">[01:36:20]</a>. Now, with advancements in [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | AI]], the technology exists to make such products effective, as demonstrated by the current ChatSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>. While web and mobile interfaces won't disappear, [[the_role_of_ai_in_product_management | AI]] can make many use cases across software "truly intuitive" by removing the translation layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>.

## Advice for Understanding and Building with AI
To understand and get ahead in the world of [[impact_of_ai_on_product_tools_on_future_product_development_skills | AI tools]] and its impact on [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management_and_development | future product development skills]], Dharmesh Shah advises:
*   **Solve a Problem You Care About:** Instead of trying to learn something abstractly, find a real problem that matters to you and try to solve it using [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.
*   **Utilize Existing Tools or APIs:** Whether using existing [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | AI tools]] or building on top of readily accessible and inexpensive APIs, the key is to "just do it and iterate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>.
*   **Learn in Public:** Sharing your process and learnings publicly can provide valuable feedback, as the internet is good at identifying areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:37">[01:38:37]</a>.

### AI in other product contexts
*   Explow, a customer-facing analytics and data reporting solution, offers [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | AI features]] for end-user report and dashboard generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:18">[02:53:18]</a>.
*   Vanta, a trust management platform, helps automate compliance and offers [[impact_of_ai_on_product_development | AI features]] to complete security questionnaires, saving hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:11">[03:47:11]</a>.

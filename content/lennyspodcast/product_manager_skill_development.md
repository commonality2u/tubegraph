Vickr Dhaman, Head of Product at Gojek, is recognized as a leading product professional in Asia for his ability to cultivate strong product and design talent, and for helping individuals transition into [[role_of_product_managers | product management]] roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. He emphasizes key traits and practices for rapid career growth in product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## [[career_growth_framework_for_product_managers | Career Growth Framework for Product Managers]]: The Three Ws

Vickr Dhaman developed a [[career_growth_framework_for_product_managers | career growth framework for product managers]] known as the "Three Ws." This framework outlines three critical areas where product managers must excel to achieve significant career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Strong product managers typically perform well in at least two of these areas, with top performers excelling in all three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### What You Produce

This aspect focuses on the tangible results and work delivered by a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

*   **Focus on Outputs Early** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>:
    *   Begin by concentrating on "outputs," such as launching products, analyzing and running experiments, or contributing to a go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
    *   The goal in the early career is to "just get stuff out and done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. It's about execution, shipping products smoothly, and being helpful to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
    *   This includes being able to quickly move on tasks that are tangibly defined and don't require extensive strategizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Examples include preparing briefs, slides for leadership reviews, or legal reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
    *   This mindset should continue even at senior levels, ensuring that individual contributor (IC) roots are not forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **Progress to Outcomes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>:
    *   As comfort with outputs grows, transition to owning and collaborating on "outcomes," which are broader product area goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
    *   A common mistake is abandoning focus on outputs when transitioning to outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. Maintaining output quality (e.g., in go-to-market strategies or product notes) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

### What You Bring to the Table

This dimension assesses the quality and impact of a product manager's direct contributions and artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

*   **Impact on Impact** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>:
    *   It's not enough for a product area to be successful; a product manager must demonstrate their useful contribution to that impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
    *   This includes the quality of product artifacts: Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), product notes, product strategy documents, and design briefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
    *   Even mid-senior PMs should be able to produce these artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Pillars of Impact** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>:
    *   Product managers are evaluated on four key pillars: data and metrics, design and research, technology skills, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
    *   Demonstrating proficiency in these areas through high-quality artifacts is essential for [[improving_product_management_skills | improving product management skills]] and career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### What's Your Operating Model

This focuses on a product manager's ability to communicate, collaborate, and navigate organizational dynamics effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

*   **Three Tenets for Collaboration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>:
    1.  Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. This means advancing the product and execution forward, ensuring the team is unblocked, and avoiding unnecessary or "stupid" work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
    2.  Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
    3.  Be in charge of getting decisions made, not making all the decisions yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Managing Pushback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>:
    *   Successful pushback involves shifting conversations from an emotional to a logical space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
    *   The goal is to add value and move the product forward, not to be seen as an obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Impediments to [[career_development_for_product_owners_and_managers | Career Growth]]

Beyond the three Ws, certain mindsets can hinder a product manager's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

1.  **Focusing on Things You Control** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>:
    *   Early in a career, PMs focus on what they control (craft, output) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
    *   As they become mid-senior, the focus often shifts to external factors (organizational decisions, stakeholder behavior, project assignments) beyond their control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
    *   Sustained growth requires maintaining focus on what *can* be controlled, such as developing skills in data, technology, communication, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
2.  **Relationship with Change** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>:
    *   Early career sees rapid skill acquisition and growth due to a high rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
    *   At mid-senior levels, the rate of change often slows as comfort sets in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
    *   To counteract this, continuously seek ways to increase the rate of personal change and [[improving_product_management_skills | improving product management skills]], including benchmarking against industry bests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
3.  **How You See Yourself** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>:
    *   Self-perceptions (e.g., "high agency PM" or "hyper-collaborative PM") can become self-limiting stories that excuse undesirable behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
    *   It's crucial to identify and correct these self-told stories, possibly by seeking feedback from trusted individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
    *   Adopting a "learner" mindset is an enabling story that fosters continuous [[improving_product_management_skills | improving product management skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## [[improving_product_management_skills | Improving Product Management Skills]]

### Openness to Feedback
Being open to feedback is paramount for [[improving_product_management_skills | improving product management skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. While internal reactions to criticism might be difficult, external responses should express appreciation to encourage further valuable feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

### Picking a Focus Area
[[improving_product_management_skills | Improving product management skills]] across all areas simultaneously is overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Instead, identify the area that offers "maximum leverage" for your growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. If you are struggling in a particular area, prioritize fixing that first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

### Tailoring Skill Development
When starting out, it's recommended to pick one area from data or technology and another from design and research to develop skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. For instance, someone with a design/research background might focus on data or tech, while someone from data/tech might focus on design/research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Once proficiency is demonstrated in two of these, then focus on strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. For [[getting_into_and_growing_in_product_management | getting into and growing in product management]], especially when transitioning from another function, it's sometimes beneficial to progress slower initially to build a stronger foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

## Defining the [[role_of_product_managers | Role of Product Managers]]

The [[role of product managers | product management role]] is often ambiguous and ill-defined across different technology companies and even within large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

*   **Ambiguity of the Role** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>:
    *   This ambiguity leads to confusion for product managers, their managers, and other stakeholders who interact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
    *   A general rule is: if something is blocking product progress, the product manager should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
    *   [[role_of_product_managers | Product management]] is seen as a discipline that improves with practice, akin to acting or dancing, which has evolved to include methods and [[frameworks_for_growth_in_product_management | frameworks for growth in product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   **PM as a "Community Enabler"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>:
    *   Product managers act as "community enablers" within a team and organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
    *   They are the only discipline that co-collaborates and ties together all other disciplines: strategy, technology, design, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
    *   Their unique insight comes from pairing with everyone else on the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
    *   The PM role ensures the team's overall contribution, energy, and output are enhanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   **Key Skill Axes for [[skills for modern product managers | modern product managers]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>:
    *   **Data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>: Ranging from defining basic metrics to having "ninja-level" data quality for independent data startup creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
    *   **Design and Research** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>: From identifying user problems to tying them directly to business goals for holistic impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Technology** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>: From basic understanding of concepts like HTTP/API to having deep debates and writing technology design documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. Data science can be bucketed under data or technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Strategy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>: Distinct from corporate or business strategy, product strategy defines *how* to climb the "mountain" (achieve broad objectives like growth or profitability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. This includes defining user segments, their needs, finding the right product for them, and sequencing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>
    *   **Collaboration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>
    *   **Organizational Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>
    *   **Community** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>

## Contrarian Views

Vickr Dhaman holds some views that may be considered contrarian in current professional discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

### Intent vs. Action
It's a common belief that "as long as your intent is right," miscommunications or missteps will be forgiven. However, Vickr argues that intent is *not* enough; actions, behavior, communication, and collaboration must also visibly demonstrate who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

### Importance of Effort and Hours
He believes it's "politically incorrect" to state directly, but putting in effort and a significant number of hours is crucial for personal growth and [[improving_product_management_skills | improving product management skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. This is distinct from workaholism but emphasizes dedication to continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

The [[Sean Ellis test | Sean Ellis test]], also known as the [[Sean Ellis test | Product Market Fit]] test, is a seemingly simple idea that has had a profound impact on the startup world, helping founders understand if they have [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] (PMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>. It was developed by Sean Ellis, an influential thinker in growth, who also coined the term "growth hacking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.

## What is The [[Sean Ellis test | Sean Ellis Test]]?

The core of the [[Sean Ellis test | Sean Ellis test]] is a single question posed to users: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Users are given multiple-choice options:
*   Very disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>
*   Somewhat disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>
*   Not disappointed or not applicable (I've already stopped using the product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>

The goal is to identify the percentage of users who would be "very disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### The 40% Threshold

Sean Ellis observed a pattern across many startups: once a product reached a high enough percentage of users saying they'd be "very disappointed" without it, those products tended to do well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This led to the establishment of the **40% threshold** as a leading indicator of [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. If the percentage falls too low, products tend to suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

While 40% is a common benchmark, it's not a rigid rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>. Its primary power is to provide a clear target for a team, signaling when to aggressively pursue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>. Cultural differences can also influence the target percentage; for example, NuBank uses 50% for their threshold, partly due to Brazilian users being generally more optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## [[metrics_for_measuring_product_success | Leading vs. Lagging Indicators]]

The [[Sean Ellis test | Sean Ellis test]] is a **leading indicator** of [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The ultimate **lagging indicator** is actual user [[metrics_for_measuring_product_success | retention]] â€“ whether users continue to use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The benefit of the survey is that it can provide insights quickly, even on day one of a product's launch, without needing a sophisticated analytics system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Application and Use Cases

The [[Sean Ellis test | Sean Ellis test]] is useful at any stage of a company, even with an MVP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Improving Low Scores (7-15%)

If the percentage of "very disappointed" users is low (e.g., 7-15%), it indicates that the product isn't yet a "must-have" for many users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. The key is to:

1.  **Focus on the "Very Disappointed" Group**: Ignore those who say they'd be "somewhat disappointed" as they view the product as a "nice-to-have" and focusing on their feedback might dilute the product for core users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.
2.  **Deeply Understand Core Users**: Dig into *who* these "very disappointed" users are, *how* they're using the product, *what problem* it solves for them, and *what they used before* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
3.  **Reposition and Streamline Onboarding**: Based on the insights from core users, reposition the product to highlight the most valued benefits and streamline [[framework_for_improving_productmarket_fit | onboarding]] to quickly deliver that core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This can significantly improve the score without substantial product changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

    *   **Case Study: Lookout**: The mobile security company Lookout initially had only 7% of users who would be very disappointed without the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. By digging into this 7%, it was discovered they valued antivirus functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Repositioning the product around antivirus and streamlining [[framework_for_improving_productmarket_fit | onboarding]] to emphasize this feature led to a 40% score in just two weeks, and 60% six months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

4.  **Strategic Focus on Core Benefits**: Use insights to inform the product roadmap, acquisition campaigns, messaging, and engagement loops, ensuring they reinforce the "must-have" aspects for the right users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### Interpreting High Scores (40%+)

A 40% or higher score indicates that a product has found a segment of users who truly value it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. However, it doesn't automatically mean readiness for aggressive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. The next step is to deeply understand the nature of this [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] to effectively grow the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

#### Qualitative Insights from the "Very Disappointed" Group

To gain deeper context, Sean Ellis recommends follow-up questions for the "very disappointed" user segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>:

1.  **What is the primary benefit you get?** Start with an open-ended question to crowdsource benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
2.  **Why is that benefit important to you?** This question, often in a follow-up multiple-choice survey, helps uncover the user's underlying context and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

    *   **Case Study: Zne (Inbox spelled backward)**: Users valued Zne for helping them "find things faster in email" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>. When asked why, many responded, "I'm drowning in email" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. This insight informed marketing campaigns, using "Drowning in email?" as a hook, leading to better customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.

#### Expanding the Base of "Must-Have" Users

Superhuman's approach to improving their score, even from users who were only "somewhat disappointed," illustrates a nuanced strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>:
*   Identify the core benefit valued by "must-have" users.
*   For "somewhat disappointed" users who also seek that *same core benefit*, ask what additional features or improvements would make the product a "must-have" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25">[01:42:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>. This allows for expansion without diluting the product's core value.

## Limitations of the Test

While widely applicable, the [[Sean Ellis test | Sean Ellis test]] has limitations:
*   **One-off products**: It's not suitable for products with a single-use experience, like watching a movie or attending a one-time workshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. For such cases, an NPS (Net Promoter Score) question might be more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>.
*   **Switching Costs/Investment**: Very high scores (e.g., 90%) can sometimes be influenced by the significant investment users have already made in a product, like building a website or setting up an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>. This suggests the product is a "must-have" due to a combination of utility and high switching costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>.

## Survey Mechanics

*   **Sample Size**: Aim for at least 30 responses to get reliable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>.
*   **Timing**: The survey should be sent to a random sample of users who have:
    *   Really used the product, not just signed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>.
    *   Hit their activation moment (e.g., used it two or more times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.
    *   Used it recently (e.g., within the last week or two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:58">[01:22:58]</a>.
*   **Tools**: Tools like Qualaroo (an in-flow survey tool), SurveyMonkey for emailed surveys, or Intercom (if the experience is good) can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>. The focus should be on a pleasant customer experience and easily processable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:52">[01:26:52]</a>.

## Relation to Growth Strategy

The [[Sean Ellis test | Sean Ellis test]] is fundamental to a sustainable [[Product Market Fit and Growth Strategy | growth strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Instead of immediately focusing on customer acquisition, Sean Ellis prioritizes internal product efficiency first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>:

1.  **Understand [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | Product Market Fit]]**: Deeply understand the core value that makes the product a "must-have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.
2.  **Define a North Star Metric**: Establish a metric that captures "units of value being delivered" to the user, reflecting how many people are experiencing the [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product market fit]] moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>.
3.  **Optimize Activation and Onboarding**: Focus on creating a seamless first-time user experience that quickly guides users to the "aha moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Users are at highest risk of churning during this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: LogMeIn**: Only 5% of sign-ups completed a remote control session, the core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:50">[01:55:50]</a>. By halting new feature development and focusing the entire team on improving sign-up to usage rate, they increased it by 1000% (from 5% to 50%) in three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:50">[01:58:50]</a>. This dramatically improved the efficiency of acquisition channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
4.  **Improve Engagement and Referral Loops**: Once activation is strong, focus on keeping users engaged and encouraging them to refer others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:32">[01:51:32]</a>. A strong foundation of organic word-of-mouth is crucial before adding incentivized referral programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
5.  **Optimize Revenue Model**: Ensure the business model is working effectively and profitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>.
6.  **Scale Customer Acquisition**: Only once these internal efficiencies are dialed in should a company "obsess" over scaling acquisition channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

This sequential approach ensures that growth efforts are built on a solid foundation of user value and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. The ability to ask the right questions about user behavior is key to diagnosing and solving growth challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

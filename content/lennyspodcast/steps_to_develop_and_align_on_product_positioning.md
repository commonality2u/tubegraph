Developing and aligning on [[understanding_product_positioning | product positioning]] is a crucial process, especially for B2B tech companies. Weak [[challenges_and_signs_of_weak_product_positioning | positioning]] can lead to sluggish sales, customer confusion, and high churn rates, impacting every metric across the pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. A key indicator of weak [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] is when potential customers say, "Could you just say that again?" or misunderstand the product's value, asking, "Why would anyone pay for that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## The Importance of Alignment

Positioning defines how a product is the best in the world at delivering specific value to a well-defined set of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. It clarifies alternatives, differentiators, unique value, and target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

A common cause of weak [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] is a lack of [[importance_of_product_vision_and_strategy_alignment | alignment]] across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. The founder, marketing, sales, and product teams might each have a slightly different understanding of the product's [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]], leading to inconsistent messaging and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

To achieve strong [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]], it must be a collaborative "team sport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Ideally, representatives from marketing, product, sales, customer success, and the executive team (especially the CEO) should work together to build and agree upon the [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This ensures everyone contributes their expertise and sings the same song when communicating the product's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Misalignment is a majority of the problem, often because one part of the company has it right, but others don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

## Steps for Developing Product Positioning

April Dunford, author of "Obviously Awesome," outlines a methodology for developing [[understanding_product_positioning | product positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. This process avoids relying on mere opinions and instead focuses on actionable insights.

### 1. Competitive Alternatives
The first step is to truly understand what you must beat to win a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. This includes:
*   **Status Quo:** What the customer is currently doing to solve the problem, even if it's inadequate (e.g., spreadsheets, pen and paper, interns). In B2B, roughly 40% of deals are lost to "no decision," meaning the customer sticks with the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.
*   **Shortlist Competitors:** Other products or services that a customer would consider as alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

Understanding these alternatives is essential to define what you need to position against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

### 2. Differentiated Capabilities
Once the competitive landscape is clear, identify the unique capabilities (features, functions, or company attributes like pricing or professional services) that your product possesses which alternatives do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. This isn't about general value, but specific differences.

### 3. Translate to Value
Next, translate those differentiated capabilities into value for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. For each unique feature, ask: "So what? Why does a customer care about this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. This process often reveals two or three core "value themes" or "value buckets" that are distinct from what might initially be assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

### 4. Best-Fit Customers
Not every company will value your unique offering in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. Define the characteristics of target accounts that care deeply about the differentiated value you provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. This moves beyond basic firmographics (company size, revenue, geography) to more actionable criteria, such as specific team structures, existing software packages, or particular problems they face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.

This step is crucial for [[developing_and_deploying_a_product_strategy | go-to-market strategy]], marketing campaigns, and sales targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>. It's about identifying the *companies* that are the best fit, not just the *people* (personas) within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.

### 5. Market Category
The final piece of [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] is defining the market category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The best market category is the context in which your product's differentiated value becomes obvious to your target customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. This should not be the starting point, as its "goodness" can only be judged after understanding the value and target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

## Output of the Positioning Process

The direct output of this process is a detailed document outlining the five core components of your [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>. However, the most critical output is a **sales narrative** (or pitch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

This narrative translates the [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] into a compelling story that resonates with qualified prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>. It should arm the sales team (and other internal stakeholders like product and customer success) to clearly articulate:
*   How the market works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.
*   What makes your product different and better for the specific target customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   Why the customer should choose your solution over alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

For B2B sales, the primary focus for [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] should be the "champion" within the account â€“ the person responsible for finding a solution and building internal consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. If the [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] doesn't resonate with the champion, the deal will likely not even make it to other stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. The goal is to arm the champion to sell the solution internally to other personas (e.g., IT, purchasing, end-users, economic buyers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

## When to Address Positioning

For very early-stage startups with few customers, it's often more appropriate to develop a "[[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] thesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. This thesis, based on assumptions and initial research, should be kept somewhat loose to allow the market to pull the product in unexpected directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. As more customer data becomes available, patterns will emerge regarding who loves the product and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. Once these patterns are clear and a company feels confident about where they consistently win, they can then "tighten up" their [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] and aggressively pursue that market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

The process of developing and aligning on [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] can be done internally, often taking a few days of intensive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>. However, external consultants are often brought in when executive teams are highly opinionated and struggle to reach [[importance_of_product_vision_and_strategy_alignment | alignment]], or when the stakes are high (e.g., before a major investment in sales and marketing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.

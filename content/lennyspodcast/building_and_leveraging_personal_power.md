Building and leveraging personal power can lead to positive outcomes such as promotions, career happiness, and reduced stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Power is not about personality but consists of skills that can be mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>. It's about understanding the world as it is, not how one wishes it to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Power can be viewed as a tool, like a hammer or a knife, which can be used for good or ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. More good people need to acquire power for it to be used for positive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:23">[01:08:23]</a>, especially for those who might typically be at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## The Seven Rules of Power

Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, teaches a popular course called "The Paths to Power" and authored "The Seven Rules of Power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. His course is described as "cod liver oil" â€“ beneficial but potentially uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. To benefit from learning about power, one must be open to the material and suspend judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This approach acknowledges that not everyone encountered in the "paths to power" is someone to emulate, but the class focuses on how to get things done and build influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

The seven rules of power are:
1.  Get out of your own way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.
2.  Break The Rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
3.  Show up in a powerful fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
4.  [[the_significance_of_personal_branding | Build a powerful brand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
5.  Network relentlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
6.  Use your power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.
7.  Understand that once power is acquired, what was done to get there will be forgiven, forgotten, or both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.

### The Knowing-Doing Gap and "Doing Power"

Pfeffer emphasizes overcoming the "knowing-doing gap," where knowledge doesn't translate into action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. His "doing power" assignments require students to apply class principles in real life to ensure learning sticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Examples of "doing power" assignments include:
*   **Goal Setting** The very first assignment asks students to define what success would look like for them by the end of the class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.
*   **Self-Assessment and Development Plan** Students rate themselves on attributes of power (e.g., energy, focus, willingness to tolerate conflict) and create a development plan to build their weak areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.
*   **Creating Resources** Students are tasked with creating resources that give them leverage, such as founding awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.
*   **[[the_significance_of_personal_branding | Building a Personal Brand Statement]]** Students write a personal brand statement, get feedback, and refine it, considering how they want to be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.
*   **Acting with Power** Students practice presenting powerfully by re-enacting scenarios and receiving feedback from colleagues and coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.

A notable success story is Derek Khan, who, as his "doing power" project in 2012, aimed to be appointed head of economic policy for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. He was offered the job (though he turned it down) and later became the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, essentially running the $6 trillion U.S. budget six years out of business school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.

### Rule 1: Get Out of Your Own Way

This rule addresses the internal barriers to acquiring power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.
*   **Confront Discomfort:** People often shy away from power because it makes them uncomfortable or they perceive it as "dirty" or "evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.
*   **Combat Imposter Syndrome:** Many suffer from the belief that they don't deserve their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. It's crucial to avoid disempowering self-talk or preemptory apologies (e.g., "I don't know if this comment is useful") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Competence over Likability:** A key takeaway is that if one wants to be liked, "get a dog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. The focus should be on performing one's job effectively, not on being liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. One is hired to do a job, not to be popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.
*   **Acknowledge Peers:** Realize that others are often no better than you, which can boost confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.

### Rule 2: Break The Rules

Breaking the rules is a way to differentiate oneself and gain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.
*   **Stand Out:** When rules are broken, one becomes memorable and stands out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
*   **Disrupt the Status Quo:** Rules are often created by those who benefit from the existing power structure. Breaking them can lead to disruption, similar to business innovators like Southwest Airlines or Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.
*   **Ask for Help:** A common rule that should be broken is the idea of not asking for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. People often overestimate how many times they'll need to ask for help, and asking for it can be uncomfortable, but the worst outcome is a "no," leaving one no worse off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
*   **Example: Jason Calacanis:** Jason consistently defies conventional wisdom in the Venture Capital industry, making many small bets, running a lean operation without partners, and leveraging his journalism background for insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

### Rule 3: Show Up in a Powerful Fashion

This rule focuses on presentation and non-verbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Visuals and Sound:** People primarily respond to how others look, secondarily to how they sound, and least to the content of what they say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>.
*   **Body Language and Presence:** Skills such as body language, eye contact, commanding a room, and purposeful gestures can be learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.
*   **Appear Confident:** Do not read from notes, maintain eye contact, keep interactions brief, use more gestures, have an open body posture, and speak with a louder voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. Anger, when used judiciously, can also signal power because it's outside the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>.
*   **Invade Personal Space (Gently):** Gentle touching on the arm or shoulder and shaking hands can be a way of projecting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.
*   **Case Study: Jack Valenti:** Valenti, a powerful lobbyist, always appeared before Congress without notes to project complete control and mastery of his material, despite being only 5 feet 2 inches tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. Students noted he "felt taller than he is" due to his presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.
*   **Learnable Skills:** Like acting, these are skills that can be learned and refined with practice and coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. One should start by pushing slightly outside their comfort zone, like applying the 15% rule, to gradually build these abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>.

### Rule 4: [[the_significance_of_personal_branding | Build a Powerful Brand]]

[[the_significance_of_personal_branding | Personal branding]] is crucial for advancement because there are fewer positions at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **Visibility is Key:** No one will promote someone they don't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. [[the_significance_of_personal_branding | Building a brand]] differentiates oneself from many others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   **Create Value:** A brand should create value for the organization and the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **Beyond Online Presence:** While online activities like podcasts and newsletters are part of it, [[the_significance_of_personal_branding | building a brand]] also involves unique actions. For example, Keith Ferrazzi at Deloitte started a quality award to boost brand recognition, and Tristan Walker at Foursquare signed partnerships before being formally hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **Substance and Visibility:** One needs substance, but without visibility, the substance will remain unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   **Reframe Self-Promotion:** Instead of viewing it as self-promotion, think of it as amplifying the team's impact or scaling oneself by sharing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

### Rule 5: Network Relentlessly

Networking, though often seen as "dirty," is essential for gaining power and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Principle of Generosity:** The first principle of networking is generosity â€“ focusing on what one can do for others, who they can introduce them to, or how they can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Expand Your Reach:** The more people one knows, the more likely they are to have valuable connections and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. [[Maximizing human potential and personal growth | Knowledge]] is power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.
*   **Example: Omid Kordestani:** Omid Kordestani, an early Google employee, spent his time networking within Netscape and then driving around Silicon Valley, talking to people about the burgeoning internet industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. This relentless networking led to his name appearing on every list for Google's first business person, making him employee number 11 and eventually a billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>.
*   **Strategic Approach:** Instead of just attending networking events, identify 10 key people important to your career goals and strategize how to meet them, perhaps by offering valuable articles or introductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   **Become a Broker:** Aim to connect people and groups who would benefit from knowing each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. This is the core function of roles like venture capitalists, investment bankers, and real estate agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.
*   **Pursue Weak Ties:** Strong ties (family, close friends) tend to have redundant information. [[Developing Conviction and Gaining BuyIn | Building ties]] with people who are more different from you (weak ties) leads to more non-redundant information and new contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. Research suggests that jobs obtained through weak ties are often better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>.

### Rule 6: Use Your Power

Using power creates more power, fostering a self-perpetuating growth cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.
*   **Mobilize Resources:** When put in a position of power, effectively using resources to achieve goals will attract more resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Success Attracts Success:** People want to associate with success. The more successful one becomes, the more opportunities and promotions will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.
*   **Perceived Power:** Simply demonstrating power can lead others to follow one's lead more readily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. People are instinctively attracted to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

### Rule 7: Success Excuses Almost Everything

This rule acknowledges that once power is attained, past actions or missteps are often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.
*   **Life is Self-Fulfilling:** The world is not homeostatic; if people believe someone is powerful, they will become more powerful, and their past will be forgotten or forgiven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.
*   **The Pragmatic Reality:** People often overlook flaws in others to be close to money, power, and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. Examples include Bill Gates (accusations of stealing code), Jeffrey Epstein (continued association despite sex offenses), and Martha Stewart (brand value increased after jail time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.
*   **Donald Trump's Example:** Trump exemplifies these rules, consistently breaking rules, building a powerful brand, and leveraging his position, with past actions often overlooked due to his perceived success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.

## The Price of Power

While pursuing power offers significant benefits, it also comes with a notable downside: a loss of autonomy and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. High-powered individuals like CEOs or presidents often have their schedules completely controlled by others and face intense public scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>. This visibility means that past actions, which might have gone unnoticed, come under a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>. Furthermore, there's a "trust dilemma" where one might question if associations and praises are for them personally or for the position they hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. This often impacts not just the individual but their family, leading to high divorce rates and personal costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>.

## Practicing Power Skills

To effectively [[enhancing_personal_productivity_and_work_efficiency | build and leverage personal power]], consistent practice and social support are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>.
*   **Seek Coaching:** Getting a coach or building a personal board of directors provides advice, social support, and accountability, which is essential for doing uncomfortable things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.
*   **Start Small:** Begin where you can, and gradually push yourself out of your comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>.
*   **Learn by Doing:** One cannot learn skills like tennis or power by merely reading or observing; active implementation and practice are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:36">[01:21:36]</a>.

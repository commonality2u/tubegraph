Understanding customer needs is crucial for product development and innovation. A common misconception is that this process solely involves identifying "pain and gain"; however, a more effective approach focuses on "context and outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Jobs to Be Done Framework

The Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework posits that people "hire" products to make progress in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This means understanding the situation (context) they are in and the outcome they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

For example, a Snickers bar is often "hired" when someone has missed a meal, has a lot of work, and is running out of energy, needing to return to tasks quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Its competitors in this context might be a protein drink, Red Bull, or coffee, not necessarily other candy bars like Milky Way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. A Milky Way, in contrast, is typically eaten after an emotional experience, often alone, for regrouping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, competing with things like a glass of wine or a run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This illustrates how [[context_vs_pain_in_customer_insights | context]] reveals the true competitive set from the "demand side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

Innovation originates from a "struggling moment" rather than a pre-existing product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Companies like [[developing_user_empathy_and_gathering_insights_for_product_development | Intercom]] and Basecamp focus on studying these struggling moments to inform their product roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## The Four Forces Model

Understanding why customers choose a new product involves four key forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>:

1.  **Push (F1)**: The push from the old product or situation. This is the context that makes someone say, "Today's the day I have to do something different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
2.  **Pull (F2)**: The pull towards a new outcome or solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
3.  **Anxiety of the New (F3)**: The apprehension associated with trying something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
4.  **Habit of the Present (F4)**: The inertia of sticking with the current solution, even if it's imperfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

People will only change behavior if the forces of Push (F1) and Pull (F2) are greater than the Anxiety (F3) and Habit (F4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This model highlights that simply adding more features (increasing pull) can also increase anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Sometimes, reducing friction (anxiety and habit) is more effective than adding features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

## [[Interviewing Techniques for Product Management | Interviewing Techniques for Product Management]]

To uncover these forces and customer needs, specific [[interviewing_techniques_for_product_management | interview techniques]] are recommended:

### Who to Interview
*   **Recently Purchased/Hired Customers**: Focus on individuals who have recently acquired your product or a competitor's product. Ask them "what in the world happened that says today's the day I need new [product/solution]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
*   **Churned Customers**: Interviewing those who have left your product can reveal crucial struggling moments and contexts that led them to seek alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. Nobody wants to change, so understanding *why* they changed is invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.
*   **People who "Tried to Make Progress"**: For new products, study what caused people to try existing alternatives, even if they failed (e.g., studying eBay and Etsy to understand transactional jobs for a new social media marketplace) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

### Interview Best Practices
*   **Focus on the Story**: The primary goal is to extract the full story of why someone decided to make a purchase or change behavior. Ask what was going on, what they were hoping for, what they were worried about, what they gave up, and how they convinced others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.
*   **Avoid Discussion Guides**: Relying on a fixed list of questions can prevent following meaningful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Instead, use the Push, Pull, Anxiety, and Habit framework to guide a natural conversation and understand their story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **Ask "Tell Me More" or "Give Me an Example"**: Instead of repeatedly asking "why," prompt for deeper elaboration or specific instances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   **Mirroring/Playing Back Incorrectly**: A technique from criminal interrogation, stating something back slightly incorrectly, encourages the interviewee to correct you and provide more detail. The moment someone says "yes," there's nothing more to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Unpack Layers of Language**: People often start with superficial answers (e.g., "I bought a car because I got a deal") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.
    *   **Pablum Layer**: Generic, surface-level responses (e.g., "my day was good") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.
    *   **Fantasy/Nightmare Layer**: Exaggerated positive or negative statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.
    *   **Actual Events**: The goal is to pull back to what *actually* happened, acting as an investigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. Most people don't know why they bought something because they only recall the moment of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.
*   **Focus on Past Actions, Not Future Intentions**: Do not trust what people *say* they will do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. Instead, focus on what they *did* and what made them try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. The phrase "bitching ain't switching" highlights that complaining doesn't equate to a willingness to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Small Sample Size**: For qualitative insights, 7-8 interviews often reveal repeating patterns of pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits. Bob Moesta typically conducts 10-12 interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

## Overcoming Misconceptions

A major misconception is interpreting JTBD as merely "pain and gain" instead of "context and outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. The biggest mistakes occur when teams hypothesize about jobs in a conference room without talking to actual customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>. When a customer's story seems irrational, it's usually because the full context is missing; the context makes the irrational rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.

## Practical Applications

*   **Online Education**: Southern New Hampshire University discovered a large market of older students who wanted to go back to school but couldn't attend physically, leading them to create an online program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Autobooks**: This company identified distinct reasons why banks wanted their invoicing software, enabling them to customize sales demos based on where the bank was in its buying process (passive looking, active looking, deciding), leading to a 4x conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Housing Development**: When building condos for downsizers, it was discovered that despite claiming they didn't want a dining room, customers were reluctant to move if they didn't know where their dining room table would go, as it represented an "emotional bank account." Building a small, symbolic space for the table, even if it wasn't practical for eating, significantly increased sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>. This highlights the importance of understanding [[techniques_for_effective_customer_communication_and_empathy | emotional and social factors]] alongside functional needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

Ultimately, effective customer interviews help uncover the "struggling moments" and the true [[customer_interactions_and_productmarket_fit | context vs. pain]] that drive customer behavior, leading to better product development and [[building_customer_relationships_and_gathering_feedback | stronger customer relationships]].

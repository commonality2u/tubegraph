A fundamental guiding light in [[product_management_insights | product management]] is to wake up each day aiming to have the biggest impact possible for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This focus on impact should supersede concerns about politics, promotions, or expanding one's organizational influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Insights from Ian McAllister

Ian McAllister, a prominent figure in [[product_management_insights | product management]], is the author of the influential post "What Separates a Top 1% PM from a Top 10% PM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He has managed over 100 [[building_a_successful_product_management_team | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> and spent 12 years at Amazon, where he built Amazon Smile and led the team responsible for scaling Alexa internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. He also worked at Airbnb and is currently at Uber, leading global product for the vehicles platform, including efforts to make Uber's fleet increasingly electric and autonomous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

McAllister's public writing, especially his post on top PMs and another on Amazon's "working backwards" process, significantly impacted his career by fostering connections within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Writing online can serve as a powerful tool for [[building_high_agency_in_product_management_roles | crystallizing thoughts]] and discovering what one truly thinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Key Attributes for Product Managers

McAllister outlines several attributes that distinguish top-tier [[product_management_insights | product managers]]:

*   **Think Big** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
*   **Communicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
*   **Simplify** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>
*   **Prioritize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>
*   **Forecast and Measure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>
*   **Execute** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>
*   **Understand Technical Trade-offs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>
*   **Understand Good Design** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>

*   **Earn Trust with Others** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
*   **Dig for Data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>
*   **Push Back Effectively** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>
*   **Adapt to Change** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>
*   **Driven by Impact, Not Promotion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>

No single PM masters all these attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### For New Product Managers

New [[product_management_insights | product managers]] should primarily focus on three core skills:
1.  **Communicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
2.  **Prioritize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>
3.  **Execute** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>

These are fundamental building blocks, while others become more crucial at senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

*   **Communication:** A lifelong skill for [[product_management_insights | product managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Essential advice includes answering first, then explaining, and learning to use numbers effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Continuous self-grading after meetings or communications helps improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
    > "Answer First and then explain, Own your problems." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>
*   **Prioritization:** Considered the number one key tool of a [[product_management_insights | product manager]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. It extends beyond choosing projects to sequencing, scope, and time management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. An innate ability to prioritize can generate 5x the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Execution:** Involves shaping what to build into a simple, high-impact package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. It's a team function, so a PM also shares ownership in enabling designers, data scientists, and engineers to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Product managers are the motive power behind execution and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

### For Senior Product Managers

For senior [[product_management_insights | product managers]], the focus shifts to:
1.  **Communicate** (stakes are higher) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>
2.  **Think Big** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>
3.  **Earn Trust** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>
4.  **Driven by Impact** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>

*   **Think Big:** Senior PMs should constantly ask if an idea can be expanded and more impactful, even if it initially seems large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. This also means taking a wider view of product success beyond typical PM scope, owning anything that influences product or customer success until someone else can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **Earn Trust:** This is a crucial "currency" for product leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Trust is built by consistently setting and meeting expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>. This includes telling the truth, launching as promised, and owning mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Losing trust happens through lying, evasiveness, or repeating mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. Earning trust also means understanding others' goals and finding alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
*   **Driven by Impact:** For leaders, this involves influencing roadmap building and daily activities to maximize company impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. Promotions and career growth are natural outcomes of sustained impact, not the primary focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. It's often beneficial for junior PMs to seek projects that are likely to have significant business impact, even if they aren't setting the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

## The Amazon Way: Working Backwards

Amazon's culture and its "working backwards" process contribute to its long employee tenures, as it provides a clear, effective framework for building and growing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. Jeff Bezos emphasized that the "working backwards" process doesn't need to be efficient early on, because the prerequisite for efficiency is knowing where you're going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. He also taught a crucial lesson: if a "press release" (a core component of working backwards) doesn't have a problem paragraph, then there isn't truly a problem to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

### Common Mistakes in Implementing Working Backwards

The most common mistake teams make when trying to adopt the "working backwards" process is starting with a solution they want to build rather than the customer's problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. They retrofit a problem or customer to fit an existing solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

[!WARNING]
When a discussion begins with "we have these ingredients, we could put them together," or focuses primarily on combining existing technologies or assets, it's a strong sign that the team is *not* truly working backwards from a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.

### The Core of Working Backwards

The core of "working backwards" is **obsessing about the problem** and being guided by it before delving into solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>. The press release and FAQ are merely mechanisms Amazon uses to enforce this problem-first mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>. If a team doesn't already have the "working backwards" muscle, these templates are excellent tools to start with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

[!INFO]
To successfully implement the "working backwards" mindset:
*   Start discussions by focusing on the customer and their problem, rather than potential solutions or technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   The template (press release + FAQ) is a *mechanism* to ensure problem-first thinking, not the goal itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. The spirit of working backwards from the customer's problem is the most important thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.
*   Assess whether an idea is: 1) a big idea, 2) something the company should be doing, and 3) has a legitimate plan to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. The "FAQ" part of the working backwards document addresses the "legitimate plan to succeed" by detailing internal components, finances, and technical hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.

While there's overhead, the working backwards process is highly recommended for any significant new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

## Continuous Improvement and Leadership

Amazon's weekly business reviews (WBRs) exemplify a mechanism for continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. These meetings, led by leaders like Jeff Wilkie, instilled an operational mindset and rigor throughout the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. Leaders were expected to be prepared to speak to variances and trends in key metrics, cascading this accountability down to their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.

Wilkie also taught the importance of "tough love" in leadership, providing direct and respectful feedback to encourage improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>. Furthermore, he emphasized teaching the *why* behind decisions, not just the *what* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. This approach helps individuals understand the mental models and patterns, allowing them to apply lessons to future situations and fostering better [[coaching_and_mentoring_in_product_management | understanding and commitment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. This continuous improvement mindset applies to every role, experience, project, and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.

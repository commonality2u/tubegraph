Airbnb's CEO, Brian Chesky, has implemented a new approach to running the company, moving away from traditional growth channels and focusing on a deeply integrated product development and marketing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>. This shift was largely influenced by the company's near-death experience during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>, which provided clarity and a mandate for significant organizational changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.

## Evolution of the Company Structure and Leadership

Chesky observed a common cycle in companies where founders initially manage directly, then delegate, leading to a focus on optimization, small thinking, bureaucracy, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>. He realized that delegating product responsibilities meant giving away the thing he was best at and hardest to replace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

Prior to the new approach, Airbnb experienced:
*   Less clarity and advocacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   Fewer resources for teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
*   Slower progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   Rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.
*   Increased politics (advocating for individual interests over the company's whole) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   Growing bureaucracy (meetings about meetings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   Many dependencies between teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
*   Lack of accountability and complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   Multiple divisions (flights, homes, business travel, etc.) operating independently, leading to divergent paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   A fragmented approach where internal teams were becoming "separate divisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### The CEO as Chief Product Officer
Chesky believes that the CEO of a product or tech company should essentially serve as the chief product officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. His decision to become deeply involved in every detail of the product and its development was a conscious move to regain clarity and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This contrasts with a common tendency for founders to "apologize" for how they want to run the company and find a "midpoint," which can make everyone miserable due to a lack of clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

> "Way too many Founders apologize for how they want to run the company... that's a good way to make everyone miserable because what everyone really wants is clarity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

He distinguishes between "micromanagement" (telling people *exactly* what to do) and "being in the details" (knowing enough to assess performance and ensure accountability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Key Organizational Changes

Inspired by insights from Apple's former creative director Hiroki Asai and Chief Design Officer Jony Ive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>, Airbnb transitioned to a more functional model, similar to a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

The key changes include:
*   **Reduced Project Load:** The company significantly cut down the number of active projects, allowing teams to focus more deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Five teams should do one thing, rather than one team doing five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.
*   **Fewer Layers of Management:** Layers were removed to create a flatter structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
*   **Functional Model:** The company moved away from divisional leaders and back to core functions: design, engineering, product (now product marketing), marketing & communications, sales, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. There is no longer a separate "guest team" and "host team" because most features involve connecting both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.
*   **Fewer, More Senior Employees:** The emphasis is on having a smaller, more senior workforce, as adding more people can often slow projects down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   **Expert Executives:** Every executive must be an expert in their functional domain, managing the work first and the people second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.
*   **Centralized Decision-Making:** Decision-making was pulled up to a smaller group (top 30-40 people) to foster "one shared consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
*   **Calendar-Driven Roadmap:** Metrics are subordinate to the calendar, with a rolling two-year product roadmap updated every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. New products are released twice a year (May and October/November) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **CEO Review Schedule:** Chesky personally reviews all product and marketing work on a regular cadence (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. This ensures accountability, identifies bottlenecks, and promotes collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
*   **In-House Creative Agency:** Airbnb built its own in-house creative group for advertising and product design, emphasizing a cohesive voice across all touch points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.
*   **Integrated Writing Functions:** UX writing was combined with marketing writing to ensure a single, consistent voice across emails, the app, and ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

## Shift from Traditional Growth Strategies

Airbnb has moved away from heavy reliance on traditional paid growth channels like performance marketing (e.g., AdWords), which it was spending a billion dollars on in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. While performance marketing can be useful for balancing supply and demand, it doesn't create accumulating advantages or long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

### Emphasis on Product-Led Growth and Brand Marketing
The new strategy centers on building the "best possible product" and educating people about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This is a [[productled_growth_strategy | product-led growth strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Key aspects of this shift:
*   **Integrated Product Management & Marketing:** The traditional product management function was dissolved, combining inbound product development with outbound product marketing responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Product managers are now responsible for understanding how people will learn about the product, doing demos, and understanding the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **Product Marketing as Education:** Marketing is viewed as educating people on unique product benefits rather than just brand advertising or performance marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. If no one markets new features, there's no purpose to shipping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Story Dictates Product:** Airbnb now starts product development by figuring out the story they want to tell, which then dictates the product itself and helps create a cohesive vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[01:03:50]</a>.
*   **Holistic Design Approach:** The company moves away from isolated A/B testing of small features (e.g., button colors) towards designing a "cohesive system" where every element relates to the whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. This involves a shift from flat design to a more three-dimensional, colorful aesthetic, aiming for more intuitive and playful interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   **Data, Research, and Intuition:** Teams are encouraged to use data, but also research and intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

### Recent Product Launches Reflecting the New Approach
Airbnb's Winter Release exemplifies this new strategy, focusing on:
*   **Guest Favorites:** A collection of two million highly-rated homes, combining Airbnb's unique inventory with the reliability expected from hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. This was developed using 370 million reviews, customer service tickets, and host cancellation data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.
*   **Overhauled Host Tab:** Designed to make managing listings easier for hosts, recognizing that a great guest experience starts with great tools for hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. This includes an AI-powered photo tour that organizes host photos by room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.
*   **Ratings and Reviews Upgrade:** Improvements to the trust system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

These launches required an integrated approach across guest and host experiences, emphasizing that collaboration across functions is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

## Setting Ambitious Goals and Avoiding Burnout

Chesky emphasizes "add a zero" thinking, pushing teams to conceptualize ideas 10x bigger or better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>. This forces teams to think differently about problems, often requiring [[effective_growth_frameworks | first principles thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>. The leader's role is to set the pace and be decisive, encouraging a bias for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. He believes a leader should see potential in people they don't see in themselves, fostering a [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

While the new approach initially required more work, it eventually led to greater efficiency and less burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. Conflicts are fewer, turnover is lower, and teams row in the same direction, reducing the need for constant reactive interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

Chesky manages personal burnout by:
*   Taking time off every other weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.
*   Prioritizing daily exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.
*   Maintaining a healthy diet and adequate sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.
*   Cultivating healthy relationships, actively staying in touch with friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.
*   Engaging in hobbies like drawing and reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.
*   Saying "no" to "fake work" – tasks that feel like work but don't move the ball forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>.

## Continuous Learning and Growth

Chesky maintains a "beginner's mindset" and curiosity, always seeking to learn and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. He studies the history of organizations (e.g., divisional structures from Dupont and General Motors) and leaders like Steve Jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. He advocates for being "shameless" about asking for help, viewing it as an honor for those providing assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

His background as an artist and industrial designer before founding Airbnb has profoundly influenced his approach to company building, emphasizing intuition, imagination, and design curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. Industrial design training, in particular, instilled a need to work with engineering, understand manufacturing, and be accountable to sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>.

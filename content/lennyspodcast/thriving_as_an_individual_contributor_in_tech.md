Aman Khan, Director of Product at Arise AI, has intentionally remained an individual contributor (IC) throughout his career, focusing on [[evolving_skills_in_the_tech_industry | building products in the AI space]] at companies like Spotify, Cruise, Zipline, and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. His decision to stay an IC reflects a growing trend, especially with the rise of AI tooling making Product Managers (PMs) more productive and companies reducing management layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Challenges of Being an IC PM

Being an IC PM is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. While AI tools have made it easier to create prototypes, the bar for product managers within a company has significantly risen in terms of expected impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. IC PMs constantly deal with shifting signals, changing priorities, and the need to unblock team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## Key Strategies for Thriving as an IC PM

Aman identifies three core areas crucial for success as an IC PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>:

### 1. Energy
Bringing positive energy can significantly reduce friction and move conversations forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This includes maintaining a positive tone in meetings and showing genuine engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Beyond just a positive demeanor, "bringing the energy" also means actively engaging in the work, even outside typical PM duties, to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. For example, Aman personally took on an "outbound salesperson" role to understand customer needs better and demonstrate commitment to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. This approach fosters empathy within the team and helps everyone push forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

### 2. Waiting vs. Wandering
Companies often prefer to "wait and see" how new technologies or market trends develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. However, a successful IC PM acts as a "Wanderer," actively exploring the unknown to discover the next direction for the product and team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. This means pushing the boundaries of what the company believes is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. It can feel "squishy" and uncertain, but comfort with this ambiguity is key to finding the "drag of the product pulling you in that direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

### 3. Amplifying the Signal
In a noisy environment, IC PMs need to find ways to amplify the crucial "signal" from customers and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. AI tools can be a superpower here. For instance, feeding meeting transcripts into large language models can quickly reveal common customer pain points, allowing a PM to "be in so many places at once" and gather insights at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

## The Role of AI in IC PM Success

AI tools significantly enhance the IC PM's ability to thrive:
*   **Prototyping and Design**: Tools like Cursor, Replit, Vercel, Midjourney, and DALL-E allow PMs to quickly mock up ideas, create functional prototypes, and visualize user stories, improving communication with design and engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Productivity**: AI tooling makes PMs much more productive, allowing them to focus on high-leverage activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying Opportunities**: The core strength of AI is building things when told what to build. This elevates the PM's role to *knowing what to build*, finding customer problems, articulating them clearly to AI tools, and having the "taste and sense of what is good and great" in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Influence**: AI tools allow PMs to "max out their influence" by making it easier to communicate ideas through prototypes and data-driven insights to design, engineering, and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Continuous Learning and Having Fun

To be a top 5% AI Product Manager, it's essential to:
*   **Focus on the Problem**: Avoid building AI for AI's sake. Instead, concentrate on the customer problem, with AI as a tool to solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Experiment and Fail**: The technology changes rapidly, and experiments may not always work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. The goal is to keep iterating, learning from failures, and continuously push the boundaries of what's possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Build a Portfolio**: Since there's no specific degree for AI product management, building a portfolio of prototypes and projects demonstrates interest, skill, and how an applicant thinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain Curiosity**: A genuine interest and curiosity in the space are crucial for discovering and applying new AI tools and techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Balance Business Goals with Exploration**: While constantly delivering customer value and moving business metrics, IC PMs must also create space for prototyping, trying new tools, and tearing down successful AI products to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. This concept is likened to "walking and chewing gum" simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Have Fun**: Ultimately, enjoying the work, staying curious, and continuously learning will lead to faster iteration and greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This mindset helps reframe stressful situations and makes the journey more enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

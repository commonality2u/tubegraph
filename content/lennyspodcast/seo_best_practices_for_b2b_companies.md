In the early days of a business, it's crucial to return to the fundamentals, building the "skeleton before you put on the makeup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. For businesses, especially B2B companies, a solid foundation for online presence and discoverability is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Foundational Steps for Online Presence

Before investing in paid advertising, several fundamental questions should be addressed:
*   **Website Presence and Performance** Do you have a website, and is it fast? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> Do search engines know it exists? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> You cannot run a successful paid ads program if your website loads in four-plus seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Discoverability** Can people find your website? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> If not, do you need to write content to ensure they find it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Clear Messaging** Ensure your website's messaging clearly explains what your business does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. Avoid generic statements that could apply to any B2B business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. Focus on explaining the problem you solve, the solution, and benefits like time or cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.
*   **Technical Setup** Ensure your website is on a platform that allows for easy editing and A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Content and SEO

For B2B companies, [[key_elements_of_an_effective_seo_strategy | SEO]] is a critical channel because most businesses are started to solve an active problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The goal is to answer people's questions and solve their problems, rather than simply selling to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Core SEO Principles

*   **Solve the User's Problem**: The primary goal of your content should be to end the user's search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. If someone reads your article after a Google search, they shouldn't need to go back to Google for more answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Beyond Keywords**: While keywords are important for search engines to direct traffic, simply "shoving keywords" into content is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The content must actually provide value and be readable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
*   **Understand Search Intent**: It's crucial to understand why someone is typing a particular keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. For example, typing "EOR" (Employer of Record) might yield results for "enhanced oil recovery" if that's what most people are searching for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. Your content should align with what Google is already surfacing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **Anticipate Next Questions**: Utilize sections like "people also ask" or related searches at the bottom of Google results to understand follow-up questions users might have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Simplicity**: Ensure content is written in a simple, easy-to-understand language, ideally at a fifth-grade reading level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. Tools like Clearscope can help assess content quality and readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

### The "Traffic Light System" for Content Prioritization

This framework helps prioritize content creation:
1.  **Keyword Identification**: Identify up to 700 keywords, both closely and distantly related to your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
2.  **Volume Ranking**: Rank these keywords from highest to lowest search volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
3.  **Intent Categorization**: For each keyword, determine the user's intent:
    *   **Green Light**: High intent; this person is actively looking for your solution and is likely to become a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
    *   **Yellow Light**: Medium intent; the person might be looking to buy, but perhaps not soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
    *   **Red Light**: Low intent; this person is not looking to buy your solution (e.g., a university student researching for an article) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
4.  **Prioritization**: Start by creating content for "green light" keywords with the highest volume, then move to "yellow light" keywords. "Red light" keywords are often not pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Operationalizing SEO

*   **Dedicated Team**: An operational content team is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. This team can be structured with roles such as a Director of Content, an operations specialist (managing freelancers, fact-checking, publishing), and writers focused on specific product lines or types of content (e.g., video, education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
*   **Consistent Output**: Businesses can aim to publish a mix of new articles and article updates weekly. For example, five new articles and five article updates per week, especially when dealing with constantly changing regulations (like in payroll or HR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. This should also extend to multiple languages for global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **No Shortcuts**: SEO is time-consuming and cannot be fully automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. Cutting corners in keyword research or content quality will result in poor resources that no one wants to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Senior team members should not consider the detailed work (like keyword research) "below them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

## When to Invest in SEO

[[evaluating_seo_opportunities_for_businesses | SEO]] is best suited for businesses where people are actively looking for a solution to a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

For B2B products that solve an active, specific problem, [[when_and_how_to_invest_in_seo_as_a_company | SEO]] is a good investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

However, for direct-to-consumer products like lipstick, SEO might not be as effective because consumers typically use social media or influencers rather than search engines for discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Even if they search for "best lipstick," an objective third-party reviewer is more likely to rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.

Ultimately, the effectiveness of SEO, like any other [[b2b_growth_strategies | growth strategy]], hinges on having a great product that users find valuable and want to continue using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. Acquisition channels will not work if the product does not live up to expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. In the B2B world, poor products lead to customers leaving and negative word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.

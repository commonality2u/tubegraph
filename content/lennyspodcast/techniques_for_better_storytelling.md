Storytelling is a powerful tool, not just for entertainment, but also for effective communication in various contexts, especially in [[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_business | business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While it's a popular buzzword, many people hesitate to truly embrace being a storyteller because it requires separating from the "herd" and taking risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, remaining in the herd makes you forgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Our minds are not designed to remember raw facts or statistics, but rather ideas attached to imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The risk of not telling stories is being completely forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Matthew Dicks, author of *Storyworthy* and a 59-time Moth StorySlam winner, offers practical and tactical advice on how to tell better stories in both life and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## The Core of Every Good Story: A 5-Second Moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>

Every compelling story revolves around a singular moment, often just a few seconds long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This moment can be one of:
*   **Transformation**: A shift from being one kind of person to a new kind of person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Realization**: A change in belief or understanding, where you once thought something and now think a new thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

These changes are often the accumulation of events and thoughts culminating in a single "flip" moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The purpose of a story is to bring this moment to utmost clarity for the audience, allowing them to experience the transformation or realization alongside the storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The majority of the story (around 98%) serves as context leading up to this crucial moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Starting at the End <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>

When telling true stories about yourself, your company, or your products, you must know the end of the story first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. The end informs everything, dictating the beginning and ensuring you have something important to convey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. A story is fundamentally about two opposing moments in time: a beginning and an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.

> "Every story essentially has those moments... you should start at the end that guarantees that you have something important to say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>

Knowing the end doesn't ruin the story; the journey to that known outcome can still be highly entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Good Story

Matthew Dicks provides a simple checklist for [[effective_storytelling_in_interviews | effective storytelling]]:

1.  **A Change Happens**: A moment of transformation or realization is critical because change has universal appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>. Even if the specific content doesn't relate to the audience, the emotional appeal of change allows for connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>.
2.  **The Dinner Test**: A story told formally should be similar to one you'd tell at a dinner party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. Avoid "performance art" elements like unattributed dialogue or starting with sound effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>. Aim for a "slightly elevated version of the dinner story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a>.
3.  **It's Your Story**: Stories must be about your own experience to allow for vulnerability and connection with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. Sharing the heart and mind of someone else doesn't require personal vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>. If telling a story about another person, center it on how their experience informed or changed *your* life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

### Avoiding "Vacation Stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>

Most "vacation stories" are simply a recounting of events that don't hold universal appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:33">[01:20:33]</a>. Unless a fundamental moment of change occurred on the vacation, only discuss that specific moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>. The location itself is often irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>.

> "The shortest version of every story is the best version of every story starting as close to the end of a story is always the best place to begin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>
> Kurt Vonnegut's advice: "Start as close to the end as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>.

## Keeping People Listening: The Four Pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>

In any context, especially in [[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_presentations | presentations]] or [[how_storytelling_creates_memorable_communication | communication]] where audiences may not be naturally inclined to listen, focus on these four elements:

1.  **Stakes**: What should the audience be worried about or wanting for you? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:35">[01:23:35]</a> If the audience isn't wondering what you'll say next, they're not listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>.
    *   **Elephant**: Plant a big, worrying thing at the beginning to grab attention, even if it's not the core of the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:24">[01:25:24]</a>.
    *   **Backpack**: Tell the audience your plan or hopes before you carry it out, so they feel invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>.
    *   **Breadcrumbs**: Offer small hints or pieces of information, building anticipation for something to happen later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>.
    *   **Hourglass**: When you reach a crucial moment where the audience is on the edge of their seat, slow time down and add details to prolong the suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>.
    *   **Crystal Ball**: Predict a possible (even if not accurate) terrible future to plant worry in the audience's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:48">[01:28:48]</a>.
    *   Stakes should build throughout the story, not just be front-loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:45">[01:31:45]</a>.

2.  **Surprise**: Deliver delightful moments that the audience didn't see coming, yet feel inevitable in retrospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:11">[01:33:11]</a>. To achieve this, subtly place information earlier in the story that makes the surprise land inevitably, without giving it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

3.  **Suspense**: Keep the audience wondering what will happen next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

4.  **Humor**: Dare to be funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:16">[01:35:16]</a>. Humor differentiates you and makes you memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:15">[01:36:15]</a>.
    *   **Nostalgia**: Leverage shared memories of the past, especially when introducing new products or services by contrasting them with older ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:11">[01:53:11]</a>.
    *   **"One of These Things is Not Like the Other"**: Present three things – two expected, one unexpected – to create a humorous contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:54">[01:56:54]</a>.

## Storytelling in Business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>

In [[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_business | business]], if you don't tell stories, you risk being forgettable and mediocre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>. Often, business communication is "round, white, and flavorless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:48">[01:34:48]</a>.

To improve [[product_management_and_storytelling | product management]] and [[role_of_storytelling_and_drawing_in_product_management | storytelling]] in a business context:

*   **Make it Personal**: Incorporate personal details about yourself into your narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. People connect with human beings, not corporate monoliths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Use a "personal interest inventory" to identify relatable aspects of your life (e.g., being married, hobbies) and strategically weave them into conversations and presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **Speak with Adjacency**: Instead of matching content to content (e.g., only talking about tubes for a tube company), match theme, meaning, or message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. Tell a story about a related theme (e.g., getting the apples you want at the grocery store) and then make the "snap" connection to the business product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>. This creates powerful, memorable connections and even builds advertising into people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>.

### Building a Bank of Stories: Homework for Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>

"Homework for Life" is a crucial practice for anyone, regardless of whether they plan to speak publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. It involves daily reflection:
*   Before bed, or periodically throughout the day, identify one moment from your day that would be worth telling as a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>.
*   Record this moment in an Excel spreadsheet or Google Sheets, with a date and a brief description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.
*   This practice develops a "lens for storytelling," helping you see meaningful moments you might otherwise miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. Over time, you'll find an endless number of stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   Beyond finding stories, Homework for Life helps recover time, slow down your perception of time, and reveal patterns in your life you might not notice otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>. It also helps lost memories "bubble up" as you connect current moments to past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>.

## [[public_speaking_tips_for_storytellers | Public Speaking Tips for Storytellers]]

For those experiencing [[techniques_to_manage_public_speaking_anxiety | public speaking anxiety]]:

*   **Understand Pre-Talk Nervousness**: 98% of nervousness occurs *before* you start speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Once you begin, most anxiety dissipates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. Accepting this can be a relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>.
*   **Preparation is Key**:
    *   **Record and Listen**: Practice your talk by recording it and listening passively while doing other tasks (e.g., chores, grocery shopping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. This allows the content to "seep into your soul" and become part of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Transitions**: Most people forget the transitions between sections of their talk, not the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Actively listen for these points and create mnemonics or clear mental cues for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:38">[01:23:38]</a>.
    *   **Avoid Memorizing**: Memorizing a talk can lead to more suffering if you forget a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>. Aim to *remember* your talk without rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>.

## The Power of "Yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>

Saying "yes" to opportunities, even those that seem crazy or undesirable, is essential for growth and finding extraordinary experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>. Refusing an opportunity often stems from the presumptuous belief that you already know what's on the other side of that "door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a>.

> "A yes can always become a no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>. You can step through the door, try something, and if it's not for you, step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>.
> The things that frighten you are often the best for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:15">[01:29:15]</a>.

## Starting Every Story: Location and Action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>

For a powerful opening to any story, always start with:

1.  **Location**: Describe where you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Location activates imagination, allowing the audience to instantly visualize the setting and apply their own adjectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:24">[01:41:24]</a>.
2.  **Action**: Something must be happening immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This signals to the audience that a story is beginning and ensures they pay attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

This opening technique is a universal signal for storytelling, encouraging people to listen and affording you the space to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

Shas Doshi, a product leader, emphasizes the critical role of effective listening, noting that many individuals, including himself, may not be listening as well as they should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. He highlights "Am I really listening?" as a crucial question he wished he had asked himself sooner in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.

## Beyond Superficial Listening

Initially, Doshi believed he was a good listener because he would recap conversations, maintain eye contact, and confirm what he heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. However, he later realized that these actions represent a superficial understanding of listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. He discovered there is an "entirely other level to listening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.

## A Gateway to World-Class Leadership

Understanding and practicing this deeper level of listening is what enables individuals to become "world-class leader[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. It's a fundamental aspect of effective [[building_effective_communication_strategies | communication strategies]] and overall leadership effectiveness.

## Cultivating Deeper Listening

Doshi notes that very few resources explicitly discuss what this "real listening" entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. For those seeking to explore this concept further, he recommends examining what Rick Rubin, Dee Hock, and Peter Drucker have said about listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

Linear, a project and issue tracking system for software companies and technical teams, has adopted a unique approach to product management that eschews traditional methods like extensive A/B testing, metric-based goals, and large product manager (PM) teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Founded in 2019 by Karri Saarinen (CEO and founding designer of Coinbase, principal designer at Airbnb), Jory, and Thomas, Linear prioritizes craft, quality, and a streamlined approach to building software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Linear's Unique Product Management Approach

### Focus on Craft and Quality
Linear places a huge emphasis on craft and quality, believing that collaboration only happens if people use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. They view quality as essential for business success, especially for tools that facilitate coordination, where even small "paper cuts" can be annoying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

This focus means:
*   **No A/B tests or metric-based goals for specific features** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Instead, they rely on taste and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing good design from the outset** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. As a market becomes more crowded, design becomes a crucial differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Accepting timeline trade-offs for quality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. If something "doesn't feel right," they delay a launch to fix it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. However, these delays are usually days, not complete reworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

### Iterative Development and Feedback
Linear does not pursue a "perfection mindset" early in the development cycle, which can hinder shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Instead, they balance pushing things out quickly with rapid improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

Their process involves:
1.  **Internal testing**: Features are shipped to production but only visible to the Linear team for internal testing and initial feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
2.  **Beta programs**: Features are released to a small, opted-in group of customers, even if "janky or not polished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This allows for early feedback before general release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
3.  **Co-creation with customers**: Especially for larger company-facing features, they find 1-10 key customers willing to work with them to evolve a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
4.  **Full General Release**: At this stage, significant attention is paid to polish and craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

### [[product_management_methodologies | The Linear Method]]
Linear has formalized its approach to product development, which it calls the [[product_management_methodologies | Linear Method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

*   **Opinionated Software**: Linear believes productivity software should be opinionated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This means providing "good defaults" or "good opinions" on how features and workflows should operate, so users and teams don't have to spend time configuring or figuring things out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. The goal is to design for "someone" rather than "everyone" to create optimized solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Cycles**: Similar to sprints, "cycles" are optional, automated timeframes (e.g., one or two weeks) during which a team focuses on a predefined set of priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This helps teams manage the "infinite list of things to do" and remain focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

### [[the_operating_model_in_product_management | Minimal Product Manager Structure]]
Linear operates with only one product manager, who serves as the Head of Product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

*   **Distributed PM Responsibilities**: Tasks typically handled by PMs are distributed across the team. Engineers and designers take on responsibilities like figuring things out, making decisions, and guiding the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
*   **Project Leads**: For every project, there's a Project Lead (either an engineer or a designer), who is responsible for getting the project started, working with the team, scoping, and communicating progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Empowering the Team**: This structure empowers the project team with ownership, allowing them to identify opportunities for improvement during the building process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. For example, an engineer implemented a "safe zone" for right-click submenus because they identified a user friction point while building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Role of Head of Product**: The Head of Product focuses on the overall product direction, steering efforts, and helping teams align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Their role is not to be in "every meeting," "making every decision," or "writing every spec" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Future of PMs**: Linear anticipates hiring more product managers in the future as the company grows, but they will operate at a higher level, focusing on specific product areas or customer segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

### Decision-Making Without Metrics
Linear does not set specific metric goals for features or launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. While they might have company-level goals (e.g., weekly active users), individual features are not optimized for specific numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

*   **"Magic and Science"**: Their decision-making is a mixture of "magic and science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
    *   **Science**: Involves extensive user research and direct engagement with customers. The entire team is encouraged to talk to users, answer questions in shared Slack channels, and understand customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Magic**: Once the team has a deep understanding of customers and the product, they use their intuition and judgment to make decisions, rather than relying solely on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This requires a culture where the company is "okay that sometimes we make mistakes" and can fix them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

## [[building_a_successful_product_management_team | Building the Team]]
Linear's hiring process is deliberate and seeks specific qualities beyond standard technical skills to support its unique product development model.

### Hiring Philosophy
Linear believes in building "better with less people" and maintains a slow, controlled growth, never doubling their team size in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

They seek candidates who:
*   **Care about craft and quality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Have "taste" and a broader perspective** beyond their specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   **Possess "product sensibility"** and can articulate their opinions with reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   **Are interested in a broader scope** and can take on more than their specific skill set or title might suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

### Paid Work Trials
Linear utilizes a paid work trial as the final step in its hiring process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. Candidates act as mini-contractors, tackling a vague problem statement (e.g., build a feature) within a specified timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

Benefits of work trials:
*   **Mutual evaluation**: Both the company and candidate see how they work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:35]</a>.
*   **Real-world environment**: Candidates gain access to the codebase, participate in meetings, and interact with the team, providing a realistic view of the company culture and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
*   **Assessing problem-solving**: Linear observes how candidates approach problems, scope tasks, and make progress quickly, which is crucial for a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

## [[product_management_insights | Growth and Brand Building]]
Linear's growth has been organic and strategic, focusing on specific market segments and building a strong brand.

### Early Growth Strategy
*   **Long private beta**: Linear operated in a private beta for almost a year after a few months of initial development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Selective invites**: Instead of inviting everyone at once, they used a waitlist with a survey to select smaller companies using supported tools who were highly interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This allowed them to onboard users in "cohorts," receive focused feedback, fix issues, and then invite the next group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Initial customers**: The first 10 companies were a mix of friends' startups and early waitlist sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Early pricing experiment**: During the private beta, they offered an optional sliding scale for payment, with users choosing how much to pay per seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This gave them confidence in a potential market and pricing range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### Product Market Fit
Linear views [[product_management_insights | product market fit]] as a spectrum rather than a binary state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. They focused on achieving a strong fit within specific market segments:
*   **Early-stage startups**: Initially, they targeted and became the default tool for early-stage startups where founders cared about speed and shared similar values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Expansion to larger companies**: The focus then shifted to making the software work better and achieving stronger [[product_management_insights | product market fit]] for larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Following the "pull"**: They pay attention to which types of companies are adopting Linear (e.g., AI companies, crypto companies) and then consider how to specifically cater to those segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Brand Building
Linear emphasizes that a brand should be authentic and is built over time through actions, communication, treatment of customers, and product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. A strong brand draws people in, aids user acquisition and retention, and shapes perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Their initial launch on Twitter, with founders sharing personal reasons for building Linear, resonated with their target audience of software builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Company Culture and Focus
Linear's culture is built around a strong belief in focus and efficiency.

*   **"Main Quest Lines" vs. "Side Quests"**: Internally, they use an RPG game analogy to encourage focus, advising employees to "avoid the side quests" and prioritize actions that directly contribute to the "main quest line" of building and improving the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   **Retention Business**: Linear operates as a "retention business," aiming for customers to start using Linear early and stay with them forever. This necessitates continuously delivering quality products and maintaining trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Remote Team Building**: As a fully remote and distributed company, Linear has adopted creative ways to foster team bonding. They hold quarterly "baking competitions" (now expanded to cooking), where team members buy ingredients with a company card, follow a chosen recipe on Zoom, and share photos of their creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. This encourages interaction and a shared appreciation for craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## [[the_future_of_product_management | The Future of Product Management]]
Linear is continuously improving its product, with upcoming features like "asks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This feature allows individuals outside product teams (e.g., IT, infrastructure) to easily send requests through Slack, which are then triaged in Linear. This allows wider company involvement in product operations without requiring everyone to be a Linear power user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

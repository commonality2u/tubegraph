Product advocates play a crucial role in the [[emergence_and_impact_of_productled_sales | emergence and impact of product-led sales]] and overall company scaling, particularly within a [[working_with_sales_in_a_productled_growth_company | product-led growth company]] with a bottom-up go-to-market (GTM) motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Their unique combination of technical expertise, user passion, and communication skills allows them to build trust and drive adoption effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.

## Early Days and Building Credibility
At Figma, the initial concept of a product advocate emerged from the need to build credibility with a technical audience like designers, who typically do not want to be "marketed to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

Instead of traditional marketing, the focus was on sharing technical features and deep product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. Claire Butler, Figma's first marketing hire, learned that content needed to be so technical that if she could write it herself, it was "probably too basic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.

The first person hired in marketing was a "designer advocate," not a marketer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. This individual was a designer who had already "loved the product and was very passionate about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. Their full-time job was to meet with users, talk to them, write and create content, and bring feedback back to the product team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. This role was crucial for:
*   **Building authenticity**: They acted as a partner to the marketing team, providing feedback on messaging and ensuring it resonated with the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.
*   **Customer Obsession**: Engineers and the early team would directly interact with users via Intercom, debugging products live and immediately fixing bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. The advocate role helped scale this direct engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>.
*   **Fostering ownership**: By directly incorporating user feedback and fixing issues, users felt more invested in the product's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

## Product Advocates in the Sales Process: The "Tom Factor"
Figma operated without a sales team for its first three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, relying on [[emergence_and_impact_of_productled_sales | product-led growth]] where individual contributors used the product and spread it internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. When a sales team was eventually introduced, a product advocate joined the same day as the first sales representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>. This advocate, Tom Lowry, was himself an [[internal_champions | internal champion]] who had previously driven Figma adoption within his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

The product advocate's [[role_of_product_teams_in_sales | role in sales]] was unique:
*   **Technical Expert**: They had no sales quota and were not part of the sales team structurally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. Instead, they acted as a technical expert with a deep understanding of the tool and a passion for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Direct User Communication**: The advocate would join sales calls to "help explain the products to other designers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. They could understand users' problems and offer solutions or best practices for using the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>. This bridged the credibility gap that a salesperson might face, as designers "never going to know the product as well as a designer will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
*   **Impact on Deals**: This approach became known as "The Tom Factor" because his involvement significantly increased the likelihood of deals closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.
*   **Product Feedback Loop**: Advocates are connected to the product team, enabling them to synthesize customer feedback and bring it back to product development, providing crucial context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

## Scaling the Product Advocate Model
The product advocate position scaled with Figma's growth and product expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Today, Figma has a large team of developer advocates and FigJam advocates, alongside regional designer advocates (e.g., in Japan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. These individuals are typically passionate users who emerge from the community and possess technical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

This scaled advocate model is considered "magic dust" for their go-to-market function, ensuring the company maintains authenticity and builds strong relationships as it grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. They are seen as essential for marketing, product, and sales, especially for technical individual contributor audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

Furthermore, these advocates help maintain relationships with [[internal_champions | internal champions]] by:
*   **Responding to feedback**: Even when users are upset, advocates directly address concerns and provide solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:34">[01:16:34]</a>.
*   **Amplifying user profiles**: Figma uses its platform (e.g., conferences like Config) to amplify the profiles of these champions, allowing them to speak, share their expertise, and grow their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This mutual benefit reinforces credibility for Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.

## Prerequisites for a Product Advocate-Led Approach
This approach is particularly effective when:
*   **Technical Audience**: The target audience is technical and deeply cares about the "craft" and tools they use, often spending many hours a day within the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.
*   **Self-Sufficient Product**: The product can provide significant value to an individual contributor even when used alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a>.
*   **Existing Community**: There is an existing community where the target audience congregates (e.g., Twitter for designers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>. This provides a natural distribution channel for communication and engagement.
*   **Collaborative Roles**: The individual contributor audience has many connection points within their organization, making it natural for them to spread the tool (e.g., designers collaborating with product managers and engineers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>.

The success of this model also relies on leadership, like Figma's CEO Dylan Field, who deeply believes in and drives this bottom-up approach, valuing signal over metrics in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:01">[01:23:01]</a>.

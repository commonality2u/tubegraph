Navigating a career in the technology sector requires a long-term perspective, especially when considering the dynamic nature of companies, from hyper-growth to what are termed "ex-growth" stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Understanding Ex-Growth Companies

An "ex-growth company" is a term coined to describe large growth companies that raised significant capital during the "blitz scaling" era but have since struggled to find or sustain their product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This phenomenon emerged as zero-percent interest rates ended, making it harder to fuel growth purely with capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

Signs that a company might be an ex-growth company include:
*   **Reframing the core product to find product-market fit**, especially if the company's valuation is in the hundreds of millions or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Still trying to find a strong "customer sucking sound"** (strong user pull or demand) despite a high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Product-market fit is identified by how much effort is required to acquire users; less marketing effort with users still coming in indicates a strong pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.
*   **Having substantial capital but not raising new rounds or undergoing layoffs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Company expectations for multi-billion dollar valuations** while still searching for product-market fit with a large team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

For employees, being in an ex-growth company can be concerning because equity may lose significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. The opportunity cost of staying can be too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
<br>
> "Danger, this is not the company to join. This is the company to leave. Find another phase, time's a wasting." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>

Reasons to consider staying at such a company might include:
*   The role offers significant learning experience, such as being on an executive team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   Strong personal loyalty or commitment to the team or the "baby" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
However, staying due to fear of not finding another job is considered a poor reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

Founders of ex-growth companies, though facing significant constraints, may be able to recapitalize, reset stock prices, or even pull the plug to restart the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

## Career Planning: Long-Term vs. Short-Term

A common mistake in [[career_development_and_growth_strategies | career development]] is focusing too much on short-term factors like disliking a boss or slow shipping processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Lateral moves, by definition, are not forward moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

It is advised to approach your career like building a product:
1.  **Work backwards from your end state**: Imagine what a great career would look like, then break it down into versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
2.  **Think beyond the "next job"**: Consider the job *after* the next, or your boss's boss's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This long-term perspective can help determine if current challenges are worth enduring for future goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
3.  **Separate career from promotion**: While promotions are internal company systems for progression, they are short-term metrics. Career growth is a longer arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

### The Value of Diverse Experiences
Collecting "fancy logos" on a resume can feel shallow for builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Instead, focus on acquiring a diverse set of experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>:
*   Working at different stages of a company (pre-[[company_growth_and_scaling_challenges | product-market fit]], scaling, mature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   Solving both internal and external problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   Experiencing consumer and business-to-business challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

Working at "Magma" (Meta, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) or similar large tech companies can be advantageous, especially for executives who need to demonstrate expertise in building at scale and managing millions or billions of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Early Career Advice for Product Managers
For early career Product Managers, two key pieces of advice are:
1.  **Become world-class in one area of ambiguity**: This could be crafting, market ambiguity, organizational ambiguity, domain expertise (e.g., ML, hardware), or team leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. [[growth_strategies_in_tech_companies | Growth]] is another key area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. Picking a lane early is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
2.  **Have a compelling story to tell**: Frame your experiences, what you learned, and how you overcame challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. Use "I" statements, not "we," to highlight your individual contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.

## Promotion and Career Progression

Four common reasons people don't get promoted are:
1.  **Lack of advocacy**: Your manager or promotion team doesn't see your potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
2.  **The next role doesn't exist**: Especially true in periods of consolidation where companies are laying people off or reducing management layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.
3.  **Impatience**: High performers often set aggressive goals for promotion and get frustrated when leadership progression takes longer, requiring more subtle soft skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
4.  **Unrecognized development areas**: A common issue where the individual has a substantive development area, but it's not clearly identified by the manager or accepted by the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

### The Importance of Feedback
To address the "unrecognized development areas" and ensure your magic is seen:
*   **Seek real, not just formal, feedback**: Formal feedback systems often don't provide the true signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
*   **Actively pull feedback**: Create a safe environment for others to give honest feedback without fear of retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
*   **Listen without justifying**: Don't immediately explain away feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
*   **Repeat back feedback**: Demonstrate understanding and internalization by articulating the feedback clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
*   **Publicly recognize feedback givers**: As a manager, acknowledging valuable feedback in team meetings encourages others to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

## The Individual Contributor (IC) Path

The rise of the senior [[career_growth_strategies_for_product_managers | Individual Contributor (IC) path]] is seen as a positive development for the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. Historically, there was a loose coupling between building skills and management skills, leading many talented builders to become average managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

The IC path allows product professionals to focus on deep expertise in their chosen area of ambiguity, such as domain expertise, market understanding, or organizational problem-solving, rather than being pushed into management for promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. This directly contrasts with a "manager" title, where the primary focus might shift to resource justification and headcount rather than building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

This trend is also common in engineering and design fields, where individuals can become VPs or CTOs without managing people, or stay as Crafters in design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. The growth of the IC path is seen as a correction to a long-standing bug in the product management career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.

### Advice for New Managers
Organizations often fail to adequately train managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. For new managers, two key points are:
1.  **Learn to share the steering wheel**: Management is not about divide and conquer or teaching someone to ride a bike and letting go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. It's more like a sidecar on a motorcycle, where the manager provides counsel while the team member drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
2.  **Earn the right to manage**: You must be invited in, like a vampire knocking on a door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. Ask what you can help with, and once invited, pick specific areas to partner on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

[[career_transition_advice_and_mentorship | Community learning]] is crucial for managers due to the lack of structured teaching in many organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. Communities offer safety, authenticity, shared experiences, and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. Examples include dedicated CPO communities and larger Slack communities for Product Managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

## Challenges for Senior Leaders

Senior leaders often possess "superpowers" that, while instrumental to their success, can create "shadows" or unforeseen development areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. The adage "what gets you there isn't what got you here" highlights that successful tools from one phase may need to be relearned or rebuilt for the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.

For example, a strong collaborator who excelled by aligning with others' views might struggle at a senior level when their opinionated leadership is perceived as lacking collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>. Other examples include:
*   Great collaborators being reticent to present their own opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.
*   Those amazing at [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | growth]] struggling with innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.
*   World-class storytellers struggling with details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.
*   "Tastemakers" struggling to introduce change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>.
*   Politically strong individuals making unprincipled decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.
*   Structured thinkers struggling with blue-sky innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.
*   Amazing listeners being indecisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

These challenges often go unrecognized because they stem from the individual's core identity and past successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. To address this, leaders should:
*   **Listen to contradictory feedback**: Do not dismiss feedback that challenges a perceived strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.
*   **Re-examine discarded feedback**: What was dismissed as "anomalous" or "weird" might be an artifact of a strength that is now causing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.

## Redefining Success in Later Career Stages

As careers extend longer (potentially 60-70 years), the "Act 3" of a career becomes more significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. Many who succeed in their initial career goals (e.g., becoming a VP, making money, starting a company) can find themselves lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>.

This phenomenon is akin to the "dog tracks" analogy:
> "The way that they motivated the dogs was they had these like fake rabbits these Tails would go around faster than the dogs which would then motivate the dogs to go around in circles and what was interesting is the moment that the dogs if they accidentally touched the rabbit they would never run again because there was like well what's next I've achieved what I was looking for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>

Just as the dogs lost their motivation after catching the rabbit, people can lose their "North Star" once they achieve their long-held career goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>. This can lead to working without purpose, sadness, creating conflict, or developing bad habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.

It is critical to start defining a "second thing" or a new "North Star" for later career stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This can involve two main arcs:
1.  **Scaled economics**: Focusing on increasing wealth through investing, private equity, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
2.  **Giving**: Pursuing activities centered on contribution to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. This can manifest as content creation, volunteering, or starting a mission-based company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. While the first two acts of a career may be focused on taking and creating, Act 3 can be a powerful time for giving, leading to greater fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

The goal is to maintain motivation and ensure there's always something important to do with your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>. This proactive approach to [[navigating_the_phases_of_a_startup_journey | career planning]] ensures a long, fulfilling career rather than plateauing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

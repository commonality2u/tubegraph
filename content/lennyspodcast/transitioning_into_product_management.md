Breaking into product management can be a rewarding career move, and there are several strategies individuals can employ to successfully make this transition.

## Anuka Gupta's Path to Product Management

Anuka Gupta, Chief Product Officer at Rubrik and a lecturer on product management at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, transitioned into product management from an engineering background [00:51:18]. This internal transition within a company is a path she recommends for aspiring product managers [00:51:28].

## Strategies for Breaking In

### Leveraging Internal Opportunities
The most effective way to transition into product management is often within the same company, as it is easier than switching companies and roles simultaneously [00:51:42]. Within an existing company, you can:
*   **Build Credibility** Demonstrate strong performance in your current role to establish credibility [00:51:50].
*   **Engage with the Product Team** Start by raising your hand for projects or initiatives that allow you to interact with the product team and gain relevant experience [00:51:59].
*   **Cultivate Relationships** Build a relationship with a product leader who might be willing to offer you a product role, even if you lack direct product experience [00:52:07].

### The Value of Product-Adjacent Roles
Even without direct PM experience, individuals from other functions bring valuable knowledge to a product role:
*   **Customer Support** Provides deep insight into customer problems and pain points [00:52:20].
*   **Sales** Offers understanding of product selling, market resonance, and objection handling [00:52:33].
*   **Engineering** Offers understanding of product building and technical nuances [00:52:43].

Joining a "product adjacent" function is generally recommended, as most functions engage with product in some capacity [00:53:21]. Once in such a role, focus on finding an inroad into the product team [00:53:31]. For small startups without established product management, there are more opportunities to take on PM-related projects and show initiative [00:54:41].

### When to Express Interest in Interviews
Expressing interest in a product management career during an interview depends on the company's stage and size:
*   **Early-stage startups** In a 20-person startup with no formal product team, expressing interest in growing into a PM role can be beneficial [00:54:08].
*   **Large companies** For a 5,000-person company, it might be better to avoid directly stating that you're interviewing for one role but actually want another, as it might not be well-received by the hiring manager [00:54:17].

## Misconceptions and Key Skills

Based on her experience teaching at Stanford, Anuka Gupta highlights a common misconception among aspiring product managers:
*   **Focus on Tools vs. Mindset** Many students believe they need to learn specific tools like Figma to be successful [00:55:31]. However, the crucial skill for product managers is the ability to navigate ambiguous situations and consistently drive clarity over time [00:55:46].

This focus on clarifying ambiguity is a core [[Challenges and responsibilities in product management|responsibility]] of the PM role [00:56:25]. Teaching product management also helps clarify mental models of the function, especially when answering questions about PM interactions with engineering or making decisions with ambiguous data [00:56:34].

## Common Paths for New PMs

From her experience with Stanford students, Anuka observes that very few directly join established companies as PMs without prior experience. The most common successful paths are:
*   **Product-Adjacent Roles** Joining a product-adjacent function and then transitioning internally [00:59:18].
*   **Small Startups** Joining small startups, where they might be the first product manager or take on a broader "Product Management++" role, allowing them to gain hands-on experience [00:59:22].

The Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework is a foundational concept for understanding customer behavior and developing successful products. Co-created by Bob Moesta and Clay Christensen, it challenges traditional product development by focusing on the "progress" customers are trying to make, rather than just their demographics or product preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Core Premise: People "Hire" Products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>

The central idea of JTBD is that people don't buy products; they **hire** them to make progress in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This perspective helps in realizing that different things can compete for the same "job," even if they are from vastly different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Context and Outcome: Beyond Pain and Gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>

A common misconception is that JTBD is solely about "pain and gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Instead, it emphasizes **context and outcome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Understanding the full context of a customer's situation can make seemingly irrational decisions rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

> "The context makes the irrational rational. So the moment you hear a story and you go I can't believe that nine times out of 10 it's because you don't have the rest of the story." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

For example, a Snickers bar isn't just competing with a Milky Way; it competes with a protein drink, a Red Bull, or coffee when someone has missed a meal, has a lot of work, and is running out of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. A Milky Way, typically eaten after an emotional experience and alone, competes with a glass of wine, a brownie, or even a run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This highlights seeing the true competitive set from the demand side, not just the supply side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Struggling Moments and Demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>

Demand for a product is caused by a **struggling moment**, not just by the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. These moments exist before a product is conceived and are the seed for true innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Product roadmaps, therefore, should be driven by the struggling moments that are being addressed, rather than just features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

> "The real thing that if you start to study causality is that a struggling moment causes demand." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>

Companies like Intercom and Basecamp focus on studying these struggling moments to guide their product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### The Four Forces of Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>

When considering a new product or service, customers navigate four forces that influence their decision to switch from an old solution (Product A) to a new one (Product B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>:

1.  **Push (F1):** The current situation pushing them away from the old product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This has nothing to do with the new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
2.  **Pull (F2):** The attraction of a new outcome or desired state from the new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
3.  **Anxiety (F3):** Concerns or fears about the new product or making the switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Adding more features can sometimes increase this anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
4.  **Habit of the Present (F4):** The inertia or comfort of sticking with the current solution, even if it's imperfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

For a customer to switch, the "push" and "pull" forces (F1 + F2) must be greater than the "anxiety" and "habit of the present" forces (F3 + F4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Reducing friction (F3 and F4) can be as effective as adding features (F2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

### Three Levels of Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>

When understanding customer motivation, consider three types of "energy" that drive action:
1.  **Functional energy:** Time, space, effort, knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.
2.  **Emotional energy:** How someone feels (e.g., frustrated, overlooked, wanting to feel better) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.
3.  **Social energy:** How others perceive them (e.g., concern about a boss's perception) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.

### Phases of the Buying Process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>

The buying process is not a single event but a journey through six phases:
1.  **First thought:** Initial awareness or thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
2.  **Passive looking:** Problem-aware but solution-unaware, learning about options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
3.  **Active looking:** Both problem and solution-aware, trying to frame a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
4.  **Deciding:** Making tradeoffs between options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
5.  **First use:** The initial experience with the new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
6.  **Ongoing use:** Building the new habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

Understanding which phase a customer is in allows for tailored engagement, such as providing different types of product demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This approach can significantly reduce sales cycles and increase conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

## Applying the Framework: [[Application of Jobs to Be Done in RealWorld Scenarios]]

### Interview Techniques for Identifying Customer Needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>

Unlike traditional market research that asks what people want, JTBD relies on interview techniques based on criminal and intelligence interrogation, focusing on understanding the causation of behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

*   **Focus on the "Story":** Ask people what happened that made them decide "today's the day" they needed a new product or made a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. This reveals pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   **Interview Recent Purchasers:** Talk to people who have recently bought your product or a competitor's product to understand their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **Interview Churned Customers:** People who have left a product are still trying to make progress. Understanding their decision to leave reveals struggling moments and friction points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.
*   **Listen for Contradictions:** Customers may say one thing but do another (e.g., wanting an energy-efficient house but buying a finished basement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
*   **Don't Trust Predictions:** Never trust what people *say* they will do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. Focus on what they *did* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. "Bitching ain't switching" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Small Sample Size:** Causal patterns often repeat within 7-8 interviews, so 10-12 interviews can be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **No Discussion Guide:** Avoid a rigid script to allow for following meaningful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.
*   **Mirroring and Probing:** Use techniques like mirroring from "Never Split the Difference" to encourage elaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. Ask "tell me more about that" or "give me an example" instead of just "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. Intentionally play things back incorrectly to prompt correction and more information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
*   **Unpack Money and Status:** When people mention money, ask why they need more money, as it often ties to other progress drivers like respect or responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.

### Identifying What to Build and What Not to Build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>

JTBD helps determine what features are truly valued by customers, avoiding "over-shooting" their needs with unnecessary complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. For example, Basecamp resisted adding complex features like Gantt charts because simplicity was a core reason why users "hired" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

A crucial question is: "What will people stop using when your product comes out?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a> This helps identify the true competitors and the specific progress customers are seeking.

## [[Challenges and Misconceptions of Implementing Jobs to Be Done]]

The biggest mistakes in implementing JTBD arise from:
*   **Hypothesizing jobs in a conference room:** This leads to inaccurate assumptions about what customers truly want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>.
*   **Focusing only on pain and gain:** Missing the crucial elements of context and outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.
*   **Only focusing on the outcome:** Neglecting the starting point and context that influences value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
*   **Building based on statistical significance:** While useful for random data, it's less efficient when the market range and causality are understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.

> "What businesses think they're selling is not what customers are buying." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a> (Peter Drucker)

## When JTBD May Not Be the Right Framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>

JTBD is less effective when:
*   **There is no real choice for the customer:** For example, understanding why people use health insurance (often chosen by employers with limited options) versus why they choose car insurance (more active decision-making) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
*   **The action is deeply habitual and unconscious:** For instance, asking someone why they bought a pack of chewing gum, as the act is often automatic and doesn't register a conscious decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. The "job" is only revealed when people change their habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

In such cases, other methods like ethnography or prototyping around frictional points might be more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Jobs to Be Done framework helps organizations become truly customer-centric by understanding the underlying "why" behind customer actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. By focusing on struggling moments, context, desired outcomes, and the forces that influence behavior, businesses can innovate effectively and build products that genuinely help people make progress in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>. It's about enabling customers to buy, rather than trying to sell to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

> [!TIP] Key Takeaways:
> 1.  Study **struggling moments** as they are the catalyst for action and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.
> 2.  Understand the **progress** people are trying to make, based on *their* context and *their* desired outcome, not your assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
> 3.  **Choose what to "suck at":** Understand the tradeoffs your product makes and ensure they align with the customer's desired tradeoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

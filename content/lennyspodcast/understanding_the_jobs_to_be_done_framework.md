From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

The Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework centers on the premise that people "hire" products or services to make progress in their lives, rather than simply "buying" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This perspective shifts the focus from product features to the underlying reasons why customers seek out solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Key Misconceptions

A common misconception is that JTBD is solely about "pain and gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. Instead, the framework emphasizes "context and outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. When a story seems irrational, it's often because the full context is missing, which actually makes the seemingly irrational, rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.

Traditional market research, focused on asking people what they want, often yields unreliable data, as what people *say* they want and what they *actually* choose are often different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

## Core Components: The Four Forces of Progress

The true competitive set of a product or service is understood from the "demand side" (customer's perspective) rather than the "supply side" (technology or business model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This is framed as a "system of behavior" driven by four forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>:

1.  **F1: Push of the Situation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>: The context or struggling moment that prompts a person to seek change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This has nothing to do with the new product but is the reason for leaving the old one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
2.  **F2: Pull of the New Solution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>: The desired outcome or new state a person envisions with a new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
3.  **F3: Anxiety of the New Solution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>: Concerns, doubts, or fears associated with adopting something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. More features can sometimes increase this anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
4.  **F4: Habit of the Present** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>: The inertia of staying with the current solution or behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

For a customer to switch products or adopt a new one, **F1 (Push) + F2 (Pull) must be greater than F3 (Anxiety) + F4 (Habit)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Reducing friction (F3 and F4) can be as effective as adding features (F2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

### Example: Snickers vs. Milky Way

While both are candy bars sold in the same aisle, their "jobs" are different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>:
*   **Snickers**: Hired as a "meal replacement" when one has missed a meal, is running low on energy, and needs to get back to work quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. It competes with protein drinks, Red Bull, or coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Its composition (peanuts, nougat, caramel) helps it stay in the stomach longer, absorbing acid and providing sustained energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.
*   **Milky Way**: Hired after an emotional experience (positive or negative) to regroup, often eaten alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. It competes with a glass of wine, a brownie, or even a run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Its caramel melts quickly, allowing it to be consumed almost like a drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

## Applications of JTBD

### Product Development

*   **Focus on Struggling Moments**: Innovation stems from studying struggling moments, not just building products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. These moments inform the product roadmap, allowing for flexibility in how a problem is solved (e.g., GPT did not exist on anyone's roadmap, but struggling moments remain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **"Zero to One" Products**: JTBD is useful for launching new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. Instead of building blindly, identify what current solutions people would "fire" when hiring your new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>. Examples include:
    *   **Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)**: Identified a struggling moment for older students who couldn't attend traditional classes but wanted to return to school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. They didn't initially build an online product, but realized a massive unmet need, leading to over 200,000 students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
    *   **Autobooks**: Helped banks offer invoicing services by understanding both small business and bank needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
    *   **Unnamed social media company (implied Facebook Marketplace)**: Studied eBay and Etsy users to understand why people sell/buy on those platforms, then built a new marketplace feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. This became a multi-billion dollar marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
    *   **Intercom**: Identified four different reasons people "hired" Intercom, then configured their product by turning off irrelevant features for specific pathways (e.g., "acquire" vs. "support"), and adjusted pricing to compete with different rivals like HubSpot and Zendesk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Existing Products**: For established products, interviewing users who have "churned" or stopped using the product can provide significant insights into new struggling moments or unmet needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>. No one wants to change unless they have to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.

### Sales Process

The buying process has distinct phases, and sales should align with the customer's buying timeline, not the company's selling timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>:
*   **First Thought** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>
*   **Passive Looking**: Problem-aware, solution-unaware, learning phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Active Looking**: Problem-aware, solution-aware, framing a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Deciding**: Making trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   **First Use** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>
*   **Ongoing Use** (building a new habit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>

By understanding where a customer is in their buying journey, sales processes can be tailored (e.g., different types of product demos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This can drastically improve conversion and shorten sales cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

### Career Growth and Job Targeting

Employees "hire" companies for progress, just as customers hire products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. People often attribute career moves to "luck," but unpacking their stories reveals pushes (e.g., lack of challenge), pulls (e.g., desire to learn, be around smarter people), anxieties, and habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. Money is often cited, but it frequently masks deeper desires for respect, responsibility, or progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. This understanding helps in [[candidate_market_fit_and_job_targeting | candidate market fit and job targeting]] and [[career_growth_framework_for_product_managers | career growth]].

## Interviewing for JTBD Insights

The goal is to understand the "causation" of behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[01:05:07]</a>, which can be challenging because most people don't fully know why they do what they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

### Best Practices for [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development | Talking to Customers]]

1.  **Read "Never Split the Difference" by Chris Voss**: Learn interrogation techniques like mirroring to encourage deeper conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. Avoid "yes" answers, as they stop the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
2.  **Interview Those Who Have Already Made the Progress**: Talk to people who have recently "bought" your product or a competitor's product, or those who have "churned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. This avoids relying on hypotheticals or stated intentions, which can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.
3.  **Don't Use a Discussion Guide**: While counter-intuitive, rigid discussion guides can prevent following meaningful tangents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. Instead, use the "pushes, pulls, anxieties, habits" framework to guide the conversation organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
4.  **Aim for 7-12 Interviews per Segment**: Causal mechanisms tend to repeat within this range, allowing for good representation without needing statistically significant numbers like 50+ interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
5.  **Probe Beyond Surface-Level Answers**: People initially give "pablum" answers (e.g., "my day was good") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. Then they might give "fantasy/nightmare" exaggerated answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. The goal is to act as an "investigator" or "interrogator" to uncover what *actually* happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.
6.  **Understand "Energy Sources"**: Look for functional (time, effort, knowledge), emotional (frustration, desire for comfort), and social (how others perceive them) energy that drives action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

### Example: The Dining Room Table

Customers of a downsizing condo development repeatedly stated they didn't want a dining room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. However, sales often stalled because people didn't know what to do with their existing dining room table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. It was an "emotional bank account" of their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. By adding a small, symbolic space for a dining table (even if not functional for dining), sales increased by 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. This reveals an "irrational contradiction" that JTBD helps uncover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>.

## When JTBD is Not the Right Framework

*   **No Real Choice**: If customers don't have a genuine choice (e.g., employer-provided health insurance vs. car insurance), JTBD is less applicable because there's no "hiring" decision to analyze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
*   **Deep Habits**: For products ingrained as deep habits (like chewing gum or laundry detergent), people often can't recall the specific moment of "purchase" or the reasons behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. The "job" is only revealed when someone changes their habitual behavior <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

## Different Flavors of JTBD

*   **Bob Moesta's Approach (Demand-Side, Qualitative)**: Developed with Clay Christensen as a method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>. It's qualitative, organic, and rooted in understanding the "causation" of behavior, focusing on individual stories and the context around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. It emphasizes that only people have jobs, not products or organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Clay Christensen's Approach (Theory/Philosophy)**: Aligned with Moesta, but more focused on turning JTBD into a theory or strategic thinking framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.
*   **Tony Ulwick's Approach (Supply-Side, Quantitative)**: Comes from a different perspective, often focusing on what functions a product can perform ("what jobs can our product do?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. This approach can be more systematic and prescriptive, especially useful in regulated or complicated industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

A common pitfall is to "hypothesize" jobs in a conference room without conducting direct customer interviews, which almost guarantees incorrect assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for [[product_management_strategies_and_frameworks | Product Management Strategies]]

1.  **Study Struggling Moments**: These are the fundamental drivers of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.
2.  **Understand Progress**: Focus on the customer's desired outcome and their starting point, not just your product's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
3.  **Choose What to Suck At**: Understand the trade-offs customers are willing to make and align your product's trade-offs with theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. Many product failures occur because the company's trade-offs don't match the customer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

The Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework is a powerful approach to understanding why customers make choices, focusing on the progress they are trying to make in their lives rather than just their demographics or product preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Co-created by Bob Moesta and Clay Christensen, it's a methodology that helps companies unlock hidden insights and create successful products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Core Premise: Hiring Products for Progress

Instead of thinking that people *buy* products, the JTBD premise suggests that people *hire* products to make progress in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This perspective shifts the focus from simply building a product and then finding customers, to understanding the "struggling moments" that cause demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Key Misconceptions

A common misconception is that JTBD is solely about "pain and gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, it's more accurately about understanding the **context** in which a customer finds themselves and the desired **outcome** they seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. When a customer's behavior seems irrational, it's usually because the full context of their situation isn't understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Another mistake is to only focus on the outcome, rather than the combination of context and outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. The value a customer places on an outcome is also influenced by their starting point; a greater journey of progress leads to greater perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

## The Four Forces of Progress

The JTBD framework identifies four forces that influence a customer's decision to "hire" a new product or "fire" an old one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>:

1.  **Push (F1):** The current situation or context that causes a "push" away from the old solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This often stems from a "struggling moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
2.  **Pull (F2):** The desire for a new outcome or a better state of being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
3.  **Anxiety (F3):** Concerns or fears associated with adopting a new solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. More features can sometimes increase this anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
4.  **Habit of the Present (F4):** The inertia or comfort associated with continuing to use the existing solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

For a customer to switch, the combined strength of the **push** and **pull** forces must be greater than the **anxiety** and **habit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This means that reducing friction (addressing anxiety and habit) can be as powerful as, or even more powerful than, adding features to create pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Real-World Applications

### Snickers vs. Milky Way

Traditionally, Snickers and Milky Way are seen as competitors because they are both candy bars sold in the same aisle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, when looking at the jobs they are hired for:
*   **Snickers** is often "hired" when someone has missed a meal, has a lot of work, and needs energy quickly. Its competitors become protein drinks, Red Bull, or coffee – anything that addresses the "hunger" job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The peanuts and nougat masticate into a ball that absorbs stomach acid, fulfilling a meal-replacement role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.
*   **Milky Way** is typically "hired" after an emotional experience, positive or negative, often eaten alone to regroup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Its competitors might be a glass of wine, a brownie, or even a run – anything that provides emotional comfort or a moment to pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The caramel melts quickly, making it feel more like a drink than food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

This example illustrates how JTBD helps reveal the true competitive set from the demand side, rather than the supply side (product features or category) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)

In 2010, SNHU identified "anomalies": students paying full price but not attending classes, instead consuming content online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Studying these individuals revealed a very different job than typical 18-24-year-olds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. These older students, often with prior college experience or degrees, were driven by a responsibility to do something new with their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. By understanding this struggling moment, SNHU grew to over 200,000 online students, becoming one of the largest universities globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### AutoBooks and the Sales Process

AutoBooks, a company helping banks offer invoicing services, realized that their sales process needed to align with the customer's buying journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. The buying process has distinct phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>:
1.  **First Thought** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>
2.  **Passive Looking:** Problem-aware but solution-unaware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
3.  **Active Looking:** Problem and solution-aware, trying to frame a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
4.  **Deciding:** Making trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
5.  **First Use** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>
6.  **Ongoing Use** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>

By tailoring their demo and sales approach to where the customer was in their buying timeline, AutoBooks significantly reduced their sales cycle and quadrupled conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This highlights the importance of designing the sales process around how customers want to buy, not how the company wants to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

### The "Dining Room Table" Story

When building homes for downsizers, customers often stated they didn't want a dining room table, claiming they were done with hosting holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. However, sales often stalled if people didn't know where their dining room table would go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. It turned out the dining table was an "emotional bank account" – a symbolic piece of furniture representing their life's memories and traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. By building a space, even a small, symbolic one, for the dining room table, sales increased by 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. This demonstrates how understanding the underlying emotional and social jobs, even when seemingly contradictory to stated needs, can lead to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

## Interviewing for Jobs to Be Done

To uncover customer needs and struggling moments, Bob Moesta recommends a qualitative approach based on criminal and intelligence interrogation techniques, rather than traditional market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

### Key Interviewing Tips

*   **Read "Never Split the Difference" by Chris Voss:** Learn techniques like mirroring to encourage interviewees to elaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. Playing back what you heard *incorrectly* can prompt them to correct you and reveal more information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
*   **Talk to People Who Have Recently Made Progress:** Focus on individuals who have recently purchased your product or a competitor's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. For new products (zero to one), interview people who are currently using competitor products to solve the problem you're addressing, understanding what they "fire" when they "hire" you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.
*   **Talk to People Who Have Churned:** Understand why they left your product. Their departure often reveals a new struggling moment or a change in context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.
*   **Don't Use a Discussion Guide:** While a framework of pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits guides the conversation, avoid a rigid set of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. This allows for deeper exploration of meaningful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.
*   **Ask "Tell me more" or "Give me an example":** Instead of repeatedly asking "why," prompt for more detailed stories and examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   **Probe Beyond Surface-Level Answers:** Customers often give superficial reasons for purchases (e.g., "I got a good deal on a car") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. Investigate deeper into the true causal mechanisms (e.g., the old car breaking down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. This process of peeling back "layers of language" feels like therapy, as most people don't consciously know their true motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.
*   **Focus on "What they did" not "What they will do":** People are poor predictors of their future actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. "Bitching ain't switching" – just because someone complains doesn't mean they'll switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Small Sample Size:** Typically, 10-12 interviews are sufficient to identify repeating patterns of pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits. More than 12 can lead to diminishing returns, and two rounds of 12 are preferred over one large batch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This is because the goal is to understand causal mechanisms, not statistical significance in a random sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.

## When JTBD is Not the Right Framework

JTBD is less effective when there is:
*   **No real choice:** If consumers have limited options or are simply given a choice (e.g., health insurance from an employer), their decision-making process isn't driven by a "job" in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
*   **Habitual behavior:** For deeply ingrained habits (like buying chewing gum), people often can't recall the specific context of their purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. It's only when a habit is broken or a change occurs that the underlying "job" becomes visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

In such cases, other methods like ethnography, prototyping, or focusing on how a product is *used* (the "little h") rather than why it's bought may be more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

## Different Approaches to Jobs to Be Done

There are different interpretations and implementations of the JTBD framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>:

*   **Bob Moesta's Approach:**
    *   Focuses on discovering the causal mechanisms behind customer choices through qualitative, organic interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>.
    *   It's a "method" for finding demand-side insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.
    *   Emphasizes that "people have jobs, products don't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a>.
    *   His book, *Demand-Side Sales*, outlines this approach for product and founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

*   **Tony Ulwick's Approach (Outcome-Driven Innovation):**
    *   Comes from a "supply-side" perspective, focusing on what a product *can do* and how to improve it based on important but unsatisfying functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>.
    *   It's a more systematic and prescriptive approach, often involving hundreds of steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
    *   Valuable for complex systems or regulated industries, but requires a highly disciplined organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

*   **Clay Christensen's Approach:**
    *   Focused more on the theory and philosophy of JTBD, a "thinking framework" and strategic perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.
    *   While distinct from Moesta's tactical method, both Moesta and Christensen's approaches were derived from the same underlying data set and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.

A major pitfall, often seen in large organizations, is attempting to hypothesize "jobs" in a conference room without actually talking to customers and uncovering contradictions or irrational behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>. JTBD research should be about *hypothesis building*, not just testing existing hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Jobs to Be Done framework helps product teams by providing a deep understanding of customer motivations and the actual progress they seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This enables companies to:

*   **Study struggling moments:** These are the seeds for true innovation and new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.
*   **Understand customer progress:** Focus on their desired outcomes and context, not just product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
*   **Choose what to "suck at":** Make deliberate trade-offs in product design that align with the customer's trade-offs, preventing product failure due to misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

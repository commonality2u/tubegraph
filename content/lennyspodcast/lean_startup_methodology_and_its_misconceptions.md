Eric Ries is widely recognized for creating the [[Lean Startup methodology and its misconceptions | Lean Startup methodology]] and movement, as well as authoring the influential book *The Lean Startup* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. He has also coined numerous terms and concepts that have become integral to tech culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. Ries currently advises [[Founders insights and their importance in startup success | founders]] and [[Earlystage startup challenges and solutions | startups]], and is the founder and executive chairman of the Long-Term Stock Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.

## Origin and Impact

The *Lean Startup* book was released in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:10">[05:01:10]</a>. Initially, Ries published his ideas anonymously via a blog, as blogging was not a common practice for professionals at the time and he was advised it could be "career suicide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:34">[07:07:34]</a>. His intention was simply to document his experiences to avoid repeatedly explaining them in meetings where he often faced skepticism or hostility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:20">[08:08:20]</a>. He observed that many established professionals believed his methods, such as shipping product 50 times a day, were "impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

Over time, what began as an "insurgent Revival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a> transformed into the default approach for [[Balancing startup mentality within larger organizations | building companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>. Young founders now often view the methodology as "obvious," a stark contrast to the initial reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>. For Ries, the true victory lies in the individual stories of how the book helps people, rather than widespread public validation or debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>.

## Core Concepts

Ries emphasizes that his work is largely descriptive, aiming to name and conceptualize phenomena that already occur, rather than prescribing new actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. Key terms he popularized include:

*   **Lean methodology**: A framework for developing businesses and products.
*   **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: The version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.
*   **Pivot**: A structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>.
*   **A/B testing**: Comparing two versions of something to see which performs better.
*   **Customer development**: Engaging with customers to understand their needs.
*   **Continuous deployment**: Releasing software frequently and in small batches.
*   **Vanity metrics**: Metrics that don't truly reflect the core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.

### Startup as an Experiment

Ries views a startup as fundamentally an experiment designed to validate hypotheses about the market and customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. This scientific approach helps prevent waste and ensures that effort is directed towards what customers truly want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:25">[01:32:25]</a>.

### Pivot

A pivot is defined as a "change in strategy without a change in vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. It signifies an iterative process of learning and adapting while maintaining fidelity to the overarching vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. Ries notes that the founder's vision itself often evolves through the process of building the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>. In his experience, a significant percentage of startups (around 20% for B2C and 40% for B2B) end up pivoting to a different product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

#### Deciding to Pivot

For founders grappling with whether to pivot, Ries advises self-reflection: if you're asking the question, you probably already know the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>. If the business isn't working, he recommends giving a fixed period of time (e.g., six weeks) to take decisive action, focusing 100% on a single, critical thing to see if it moves the needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>. If multiple new ideas emerge, try them in sequence within available runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.

> "If you're not sure you're sure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>.
>
> "The first thing is just try being uncomfortably small in the thing that you actually make" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

Ries highlights that the [[Resilience and Persistence in Startups | psychological toll]] of admitting failure is profound, and many founders prefer to maintain a narrative of continuous success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>. However, the core lesson of the scientific method is: "if you can't fail you can't learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The term "MVP" is frequently misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>.

#### Misconceptions about MVP

*   **MVP means building a "bare bones, stripped-down thing that will crash your computer"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:36">[01:28:36]</a>. This is incorrect; an MVP is about finding the most efficient way to validate a hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:47">[01:28:47]</a>. The quality bar for "viable" varies greatly by industry (e.g., iOS apps vs. jet engines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.
*   **MVPs are necessarily "low quality" or "cheap"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Ries clarifies that "quality is defined by the customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:36">[01:32:36]</a>. An MVP can be high quality if the context demands it, but it must be feature-constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>. The focus is on testing the core value proposition, not delivering a full-featured product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:38">[01:33:38]</a>. Building a high-quality product that customers don't want is the ultimate waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:25">[01:32:25]</a>.
*   **The initial MVP is what you'll stick with**: Often, 90% of the work in the first version is discarded regardless of its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>.

#### Tactical Advice for MVP

To define an MVP, Ries suggests:
1.  Write a list of necessary features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>.
2.  Cut it in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:12">[01:43:12]</a>.
3.  Cut it in half again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:12">[01:43:12]</a>.
Founders often overestimate the necessary scope by "one or two orders of magnitude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:31">[01:43:31]</a>. If a team struggles to define an MVP, the problem usually lies "upstream" in a lack of clarity about what they want to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:20">[01:44:20]</a>.

A historical example from Ries's experience at IMVU demonstrates this: by offering a seemingly "ugly" teleportation feature instead of sophisticated 3D avatar movement, they learned customers valued instantaneous travel more than realistic animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>. This showed that "less is more" can sometimes yield unexpected value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:54">[01:34:54]</a>.

### Other Misconceptions about Lean Startup

*   **Lean means cheap**: This is a common misconception, implying that Lean Startup is only for companies not raising money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:56">[02:22:56]</a>.
*   **Lean is opposed to having a vision**: Some believe that being "Lean" means sacrificing visionary thinking for incremental experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:09">[02:23:09]</a>. Ries clarifies that a clear vision is foundational, and experimentation serves to validate that vision.
*   **Experimentation leads only to local maxima**: Critics argue that continuous iteration might prevent breakthroughs, but Ries counters that true scientific experimentation is about understanding the fundamental drivers of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:15">[02:23:15]</a>.

## Evolution of the Lean Startup Movement

The [[Lean Startup methodology and its misconceptions | Lean Startup movement]] has matured from a disruptive force to a widely adopted standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>. Ries notes a shift in focus from "religious revival" conferences to the quieter, more impactful stories of individuals who find the methodology helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. He actively rejects the idea of Lean Startup becoming a rigid "religion" with "heretics," emphasizing that "whatever works is Lean Startup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.

## Responsibility of Thought Leaders

Ries reflects on the responsibility of authors and thought leaders for the ideas they put into the world, acknowledging that concepts like "disruption" have been misused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">[02:21:17]</a>. He feels a duty to "get it right," not just for his own satisfaction but based on empirical evidence of how people use the ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. He believes testing and experimentation are crucial for authors to understand if their hypotheses are correct and to communicate them more clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:10">[02:22:10]</a>.

## Impact of AI on Product Development

Ries views AI as a "management technology" that will significantly change organizational structures and workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>. AI's ability to summarize vast amounts of information could reduce the need for extensive middle management, potentially flattening hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.

He notes that the core challenge with AI, similar to human organizations, is alignment; AI will reflect the organizational values of its creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>. Ries envisions a future where AI-powered marketplaces could create greater fairness by efficiently filtering relevant information, allowing consumers to receive proposals based purely on need rather than existing relationships or marketing spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:28">[01:29:28]</a>.

## Craft vs. MVP

Ries believes that "craft" in product development is critically important but should not be an excuse to avoid feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:49">[01:49:49]</a>. True craft often involves building one thing "extraordinarily well" rather than many things poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:28">[01:49:28]</a>. High-quality code or robust primitives are part of craft that enables speed, not slows it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:17">[01:51:17]</a>. If a founder's core values dictate a certain level of craftsmanship or design ethos, these should be honored, but they also increase the need for rigorous experimentation to validate other aspects of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:25">[01:52:25]</a>.

## Broader Philosophy and Future Outlook

Ries stresses that a startup's failure is not the "worst thing that can happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>; far worse is being trapped in a "zombie undead company" that you hate but cannot leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. He notes a growing "mental health crisis among [[Founders insights and their importance in startup success | founders]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. For founders trapped in such situations, he advises introspection: if you wouldn't start this company again today, it's okay to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:30">[01:58:30]</a>.

His current work focuses on corporate governance, aiming to ensure that companies are structured to promote "human flourishing" and long-term value creation beyond mere financial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:53">[01:39:53]</a>. He believes that aligning organizational values with ethical outcomes will be a competitive advantage, attracting talent and fostering greater trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:11">[01:41:11]</a>.

Ries encourages founders to embed promises (e.g., to stakeholders beyond shareholders) into the company's legal structure from the outset, rather than waiting until it's "too late" during later growth stages or IPOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:05">[01:54:05]</a>. This means proactive conversations with legal counsel about mechanisms like Public Benefit Corporations, mission pledges for board members, or specific financing instruments to protect core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:56">[01:44:56]</a>. He argues that the traditional "shareholder primacy theory" of corporations is often "wrong" even for maximizing shareholder returns, as prioritizing long-term value and human flourishing can lead to superior financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:49">[01:53:49]</a>.

Ries's overall message for the startup community is an empowering one: as the "manufacturers" of new companies, founders collectively have the power to define the terms by which these "beings" operate in the world, insisting on values that ensure positive impact and long-term trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:01">[02:13:01]</a>.

## Unpopular Concepts

Ries has proposed several concepts he thought would gain more traction but didn't, including:

*   **Cell biology as a metaphor for startups**: An attempt to use biological terms to describe startup dynamics, which "not one person understood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:53">[02:05:53]</a>.
*   **Engagement Loops**: A concept similar to viral loops, but focused on how customers "stick" with a product, modeling the dynamics of user retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:20">[02:06:20]</a>. He notes that while there's a science to stickiness, it hasn't garnered the same attention as viral growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:29">[02:06:29]</a>.

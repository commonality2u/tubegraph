The [[the_role_of_product_managers | role of product management]] is crucial in building successful products, requiring a blend of strategic thinking, execution, and communication. Insights from experienced product leaders like Shreyas Doshi highlight key principles and frameworks that define the [[the_role_of_product_managers | art of product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Shreyas Doshi's Background and Journey to Product Management

Shreyas Doshi, a prominent voice in [[the_evolution and_future_of_product_management | product management]], is known for his memorable, contrarian, and insightful advice rooted in real-life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Born in Mumbai, India, he lived there for 21 years before moving to the United States for graduate studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. His father was a businessman who manufactured and marketed spices, exposing Doshi to aspects of packaging, pricing, and even grunt work like packaging spices as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Originally studying computer engineering, Doshi started his career as an engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. He moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and got his first taste of [[the_role of_product_managers | product management]] when his managers at a startup (formerly Loudcloud, acquired by EDS) began sending him to internal customer meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. He enjoyed understanding customer needs and devising creative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. For about a year, he performed [[the_role_of_product_managers | product management]] tasks without the official title, often building solutions himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. He realized he would not be a "great" engineer (top 10%) but became increasingly interested in product, leading to his career transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Doshi credits the people who gave him a chance to do product work for enabling his transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Key Learnings from Leading Tech Companies

Doshi has worked at prominent tech companies including Yahoo, Twitter, Google, and Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

*   **Yahoo (Identity Team)**: Learned the importance of building multiple services under a single account (e.g., "one Yahoo ID"), a powerful bundling idea later excelled by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. He noted that integrating acquisitions like Flickr with Yahoo accounts faced initial backlash but eventually became accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Google (Ads Team)**: Emphasized the power of "thinking really big" and prioritizing "billion-dollar opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Google's ads business, for example, would often not pursue opportunities generating less than $100 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. This ingrained the habit of asking "What does it take to make it bigger?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. However, this high bar could sometimes lead to missing smaller, emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   **Twitter**: Observed the "stickiness" that results from combining **network effects** with **core product differentiation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. Twitter's unique product combined with its network effects enabled its staying power despite infrastructure and leadership [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_product_management | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   **Stripe**: Witnessed the "magic" of combining **high energy, sound judgment, low ego, and small teams** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This combination was more prevalent at Stripe than any other place he worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

### Product Management and Leadership Insights

Doshi gleaned specific [[product_management_and_leadership_insights | leadership insights]] from company founders:

*   **Larry Page (Google)**: Appreciated his strategic insight and ability to "simulate the future" to make better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.
*   **Jack Dorsey (Twitter)**: Struck by his ability to listen intently and ask vital questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. For example, during an acquisition discussion, Dorsey asked, "How does this make our users love Twitter more?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. This simple question forced a deeper, user-centric perspective beyond metrics and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **John Collison (Stripe)**: Learned much about marketing and communicating the product in terms customers truly understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. He emphasized separating the effort of building a feature from the effort of talking about it, and focusing on what resonates with customers, not necessarily what was hardest to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **Patrick Collison (Stripe)**: Highlighted Patrick's ability to think and communicate clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
*   **Both Collisons**: Demonstrated the importance of setting culture by consistently *living* the desired values and behaviors, which speaks louder than written values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.

## Five Big Ideas in Product Management

Doshi shares five key ideas that provide insights into effective [[the_role_of_product_managers | product management]].

### 1. The Power of Pre-mortems

A pre-mortem is a proactive exercise where a team imagines a project has failed and works backward to identify potential causes of that failure before it happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. This concept, learned from a Harvard Business Review article by Gary Klein, is meant to extract insights before things go wrong, preventing "ugly post-mortems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

*   **Initial Prompt**: "Imagine this project that we are working on has failed six months from now, or this launch has miserably failed. Now let's work backwards from there and ask ourselves, what went wrong? What could have contributed to this utter failure?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Psychological Safety**: It gives team members license to express concerns they might otherwise hesitate to voice due to a desire to be positive or optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
    *   **Catharsis**: Discussing potential failures can make the team feel lighter and more prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
    *   **Shared Vocabulary**: Creates common terms for discussing risks, making it easier to raise issues in future meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Execution**:
    *   Include people from every function involved in the project or launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. For large launches, separate pre-mortems can be held for engineering and go-to-market teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.
    *   Alternate between speaking and quiet time where individuals privately record their thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.
    *   Use specific categories for risks:
        *   **Tiger**: A threat that "will actually kill us" (problematic, harmful issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.
        *   **Paper Tiger**: A seeming threat that others might worry about, but you are not concerned about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.
        *   **Elephant**: The "elephant in the room" that nobody is talking about (e.g., an unspoken assumption that might not hold true) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.
    *   After sharing, participants pick the *scariest tiger someone else mentioned* to prioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.
    *   The leader is responsible for prioritizing the identified risks and creating a post-pre-mortem action plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.

Pre-mortems can prevent issues that might otherwise lead to public backlash or wasted time, by making obvious problems visible and addressable within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.

### 2. The LNO Framework (Leverage, Neutral, Overhead Tasks)

This framework helps [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_product_management | product managers]] prioritize their finite time by categorizing tasks based on their return on effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>. Doshi developed this framework after experiencing significant stress and overwhelm as a new PM at Google, constantly battling an endless to-do list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

*   **L-tasks (Leverage)**: Yield 10x or 100x return on effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. Examples include crafting a crucial PRD for an important feature or aligning two teams for significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. These are often the tasks that intimidate or require dedicated attention, leading to procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>.
*   **N-tasks (Neutral)**: Yield approximately 1x return on effort (what you put in, you get back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **O-tasks (Overhead)**: Yield significantly less than 1x return on effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. A classic example is an expense report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.

The key is that the *same activity* can be an L, N, or O task depending on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. For example, a bug report can be high-leverage if it's critical and requires meticulous detail, or overhead if it's minor and can be quickly filed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. Similarly, taking notes can be an L-task (e.g., documenting a contentious CEO review) or an O-task (e.g., quickly listing action items for a standard meeting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.

**Tactics for L-tasks**:
*   **Placebo Productivity**: Intentionally fill days leading up to an L-task with N and O tasks to "trick" oneself into feeling ready for the L-task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.
*   **Change of Location**: Working from a different environment (e.g., coffee shop, co-working space) can force focus and a shift in mindset to tackle L-tasks effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

### 3. The Three Levels of Product Work (Impact, Execution, Optics)

Understanding these three levels helps explain conflicts and misalignments within teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>. Individuals and leaders often default to thinking at different levels, leading to misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.

*   **Impact Level**: Focuses on the overall effect or outcome, such as impact on the customer experience or brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. CEOs and founders often operate at this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.
*   **Execution Level**: Focuses on getting things done, hitting milestones, and the practicalities of implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. Product managers often operate at this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.
*   **Optics Level**: About creating awareness of the impact and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>. Internal optics (e.g., status updates, internal presentations) is important for creating energy, awareness, excitement, and feedback opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. However, problems arise when optics becomes the *goal* rather than a means to an end, leading organizations to implicitly reward optics over actual results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>.

The goal is not to declare one level "right," but to establish a shared vocabulary and explicitly decide which level is most important given the team's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. For early-stage teams, optimizing for execution might be critical, while a platform team facing availability issues might need to focus on optics to improve communication with dependent teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.

### 4. Most Execution Problems are Actually Strategy or Culture Problems

Doshi realized late in his [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | leadership]] career that most execution problems in high-performing environments (where intentions are good) are often symptoms of deeper issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>. Leaders often find themselves constantly solving execution problems, like a "vacuum hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.

*   **Strategy Problems**: Misalignment between teams often stems from unclear or different strategies, or a lack of understanding of the overall strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>. Without a clear strategy, teams might craft misaligned OKRs and lack a sense of priorities or how to adapt to changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.
*   **Culture Problems**: Execution issues can arise from a culture that incentivizes individual team OKRs over company-wide collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. For example, if a team's manager is penalized for helping another team at the expense of their own OKRs, collaboration suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.
*   **Interpersonal Problems**: Sometimes, the issue is simply that key individuals (e.g., two team managers) don't get along, creating constant friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. A leader's role is to spot this and [[coaching_and_leadership_in_product_management | coach them through their differences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.

**Signs it's not a true execution problem**: When "band-aids" (e.g., new processes, more meetings) are applied repeatedly but the same problem persists, it's likely a deeper strategy, culture, or interpersonal issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a>. True execution problems, by contrast, might be due to infrastructure limitations or skill gaps within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.

### 5. Prioritization: Minimizing Opportunity Cost vs. ROI

In high-leverage roles like [[the_role_of_product_managers | product management]], many things can provide a positive Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>. However, solely chasing positive ROI can lead to prioritizing "quick wins" or "low-hanging fruit" by trying to decrease the "time taken" (denominator in the ROI formula) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.

Instead, the focus should shift to **minimizing opportunity cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. Opportunity cost is the difference between the value of the optimal option and the value of the chosen option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>. This means asking, "Is this the *best* use of my time?" rather than "Is this a *good* use of my time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

This subtle but profound shift encourages tackling ambiguous but potentially game-changing projects, even if they require more initial effort to flesh out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

**Tactical Application for Leaders**:
Instead of micro-quantifying opportunity costs, leaders can provide rough allocation guidance for planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a>. For example, a "70-20-10" rule like Google's:
*   **60% Incremental Features**: Focus on high-ROI, day-to-day improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>.
*   **30% Big New Initiatives**: Dedicate resources to 1-2 significant bets that could change the business trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.
*   **10% Stability and Infrastructure**: Allocate time for foundational work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:49">[01:23:49]</a>.
This guidance gives teams the freedom and permission to explore and pursue opportunities that minimize opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.

### Bonus Idea: High Agency

"High agency" is about finding a way to achieve desired outcomes without waiting for perfect conditions or blaming circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:24">[01:25:24]</a>. High-agency individuals push through or reverse adverse conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:42">[01:25:42]</a>.

This trait is particularly vital for [[the_role_of_product_managers | product managers]] because they constantly face adverse conditions, such as limited resources, legacy infrastructure, staffing issues, and customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:59">[01:25:59]</a>. Doshi observed that PMs who exceed expectations, regardless of their credentials, possess high agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>.

Key components of high agency for PMs:
*   **Strong Ownership Mindset**: Taking responsibility for outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>.
*   **Creative Execution**: Finding innovative ways to navigate [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_product_management | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>.
*   **Resilience**: Persisting in the face of difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:04">[01:28:04]</a>.

High agency provides PMs with the empowerment to take responsibility and contribute to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:42">[01:28:42]</a>.

## Challenges and Strategies for Developing Effective Rating Systems

Effective rating and feedback systems are central to the operation of online marketplaces, enabling users to learn about matches and providing crucial data for platform improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. While seemingly straightforward, designing and implementing these systems comes with [[challenges_in_product_management | significant challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>.

### Core Functions of Rating Systems
Rating systems gather information from completed matches to help users and the platform make better decisions in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This includes:
*   **Active Data Collection** when users leave explicit ratings (e.g., five stars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Passive Data Collection** from user behavior (e.g., leaving a booking early) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

The data gathered helps refine processes for finding potential matches, making matches, and continually learning about those matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Challenges in Designing Rating Systems
There is currently no perfect model for rating systems, as they face several inherent challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>:

*   **Rating Inflation**
    *   The median rating on marketplaces tends to inflate over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>, a phenomenon observed in platforms like Uber and Upwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.
    *   **Reciprocity Issue**: Users often find it "costless" to leave a positive rating when asked, and are generally disinclined to be "mean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.
    *   **Norming**: As overall ratings rise, user expectations shift, leading to a new normal. A four-star rating, which might have been good initially, can later feel like "screwing this person over" because the norm has become higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.

*   **Impact of Averaging**
    *   A default practice for many marketplaces is to simply average ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.
    *   **Distributional Consequences**: This practice can have significant impacts on who succeeds and who fails on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>.
        *   An established entity with thousands of reviews will see its average rating remain virtually unchanged by new reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
        *   A new participant who receives a single negative review early on can be "completely screwed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. Research on eBay showed a single negative first rating could lead to an 8% immediate hit on expected revenue and was a significant indicator of potential platform exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.

*   **Sound of Silence**
    *   There is significant information in the "ratings that are not left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>. This "lack of a response" can be more predictive of a seller's performance than explicit positive ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. It's often easier for users to simply not leave a review than to leave a negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.

### Strategies for Effective Rating Systems

*   **Renorming Labels**: Instead of generic "poor to excellent" or star ratings, consider labels like "exceeded expectations" for top ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Comparative Questions**: Ask users to compare their current experience to past experiences they rated highly (e.g., "how did this compare to this experience you had in the past that you rate really highly?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. This makes it easier for users to provide nuanced feedback without feeling like they are "dinging" someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>. Airbnb has implemented such comparative questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.
*   **Addressing Distributional Fairness**:
    *   Platforms might choose to hide ratings until a new participant accumulates a certain number of reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>.
    *   **Bayesian Approach (Prior Beliefs)**: Instead of simple averaging, combine a new participant's ratings with a "prior belief" about typical performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. This means if a new person gets one negative rating, the prior belief can "pull their rating up a little bit," giving them a better chance to gain work and stay on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. This approach aims for [[Challenges and success rates in experimentation | distributional fairness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.
*   **Double-Blind Reviews**: Systems where neither party sees the other's review until both have submitted theirs can significantly increase review rates, providing more data for the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>. Airbnb's "double-blind reviews" are an example of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>.

> "Many of the things that we would choose to do and the reallocation they create can't necessarily create observed pie expanding winds in the short run...you're often bets that that's where you're headed partly through the reallocation that you're doing right now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>
> â€” Ramesh Johari, Professor at Stanford University

Despite the challenges, rating systems are crucial because they allow marketplaces to learn from matches, providing insights into platform performance and user behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>. The fundamental nature of a marketplace means that changes often create "winners and losers," and understanding these reallocations of attention and inventory is key to effective management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, even if it's a "whack-a-mole" game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

Linear, the project and issue tracking system, employs a unique and deliberate approach to [[hiring_and_firing_in_startup_teams | hiring]] and team building, emphasizing quality, broad scope, and practical assessment through paid work trials. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>

## Philosophy Behind Hiring

The co-founders of Linear believe that building better quality products is more achievable with fewer, higher-quality people, rather than a larger team of average individuals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a> This belief shapes their entire [[hiring_and_firing_in_startup_teams | hiring]] strategy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a> They have historically grown slowly, never more than doubling their team size in a year, and may even slow down further in the future. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>

A core aspect of their [[hiring_and_firing_in_startup_teams | hiring]] philosophy is looking for candidates who care about the product and possess a broader perspective beyond their specific role. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>

## Key Traits Linear Seeks in Candidates

*   **Broad Scope & Product Sensibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>: Linear seeks individuals interested in a broader scope of work than just their specific skill set. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a> This means that engineers and designers, for instance, are expected to engage in tasks often associated with product management, such as thinking about scope, communicating progress, and understanding customer needs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a> They look for candidates who can articulate *why* certain product choices are better than others, demonstrate product thinking, and use their own judgment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>
*   **Ownership & Versatility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>: The company prefers individuals who can "pick up things more easily" and work collaboratively because they have a shared understanding of different areas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a> This helps avoid situations where people say, "it's not my job." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a> New hires are expected to take on more scope and responsibility from the beginning, rather than having to climb organizational levels for influence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>
*   **Taste and Opinions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>: For any role, Linear looks for "taste" or an understanding of how things should be done. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a> This applies to engineers with product sensibility, marketing hires with an appreciation for storytelling and writing, and operations personnel with an understanding of HR. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>
*   **Customer Empathy**: The entire team is encouraged to frequently interact with customers, answer questions, and understand their problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a> This deep understanding of users and their challenges is crucial, enabling intuition-driven decisions rather than relying solely on metrics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>

## Interviewing for Product Sensibility

When interviewing for [[behavioral_and_situational_interview_techniques | product sensibility]], the interviewer, even if non-technical, asks candidates about their past projects, probing deep into:
*   Why specific decisions were made. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>
*   Whether the candidate agreed with those decisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>
*   What they might have done differently. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>

This approach aims to assess if candidates have well-reasoned opinions based on context and user impact, rather than just subjective preferences. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>

## Paid Work Trials

Linear's final [[hiring_and_firing_in_startup_teams | hiring]] step for all employees is a paid work trial, which varies in length depending on the role and candidate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>

### How it Works
Candidates work as mini-contractors, given a vague problem statement, such as building a feature. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a> They must:
1.  Understand the problem. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>
2.  Scope it down to what's achievable within the given timeframe. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>
3.  Gain access to the codebase (for engineers) and build a version of the solution. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>
4.  Present their work and reasoning. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>

### Benefits
*   **Mutual Assessment**: The trial allows both the company and the candidate to see how they work together. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>
*   **Candidate Insight**: Candidates experience the company culture, understand the level of ownership, and see the quality of the codebase. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a> This is particularly valuable for startups, where operations can vary greatly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>
*   **Operational Readiness**: Candidates gain access to internal tools (Slack, Notion) and participate in meetings, helping them get to know the team. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>
*   **Evaluating Adaptability**: Linear can assess how candidates operate in their environment, approach problems, think, and make progress quickly, which is crucial for startups. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>

While potential candidates may have existing jobs, Linear works with them to schedule trials during weekends, vacations, or holidays. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a> Few candidates decline, as the experience often makes them feel more confident about joining the company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>

> [!tip] Founders looking to [[overcoming_hiring_challenges_in_tech_startups | overcome hiring challenges]] and instill a similar culture should prioritize spending more time on [[hiring_and_firing_in_startup_teams | hiring]]. This means interviewing engineers for product skills, not just technical ones, and identifying individuals interested in a broader scope of work. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>

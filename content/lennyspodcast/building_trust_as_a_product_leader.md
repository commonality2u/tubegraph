Trust is considered the "currency of a product manager and a product leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>. It is crucial for career growth and effective leadership in product management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.

## Importance of Trust
For product leaders, [[importance_of_trust_and_vulnerability_in_leadership | trust]] is vital for several reasons:
*   **Resource Allocation** If leadership does not trust a product leader to effectively use resources or deliver on promises, they are unlikely to receive additional resources for bigger initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:19">[01:24:19]</a>. Conversely, a track record of building trust as a good steward of resources and making impact directly correlates with the ability to gain more resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a>.
*   **Influence and Growth** High standards for oneself and recognizing trust as a crucial currency will help a product leader grow and succeed at any level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>.

## Building Trust
Trust is fundamentally built by "repeatedly setting and meeting expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:38">[01:24:38]</a>. This involves:
*   **Calling your shots:** Forecasting and setting goals, then consistently hitting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>.
*   **Truthfulness:** Always telling the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.
*   **Delivery on Promises:** Launching products when promised and ensuring they match what was committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a>.
*   **Owning Mistakes:** Taking responsibility for errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>. [[managing_failure_and_rebuilding_trust | Managing failure and rebuilding trust]]
*   **Understanding Others' Goals:** Spending time and energy to understand the goals of other individuals and their organizations to achieve alignment and forge alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:33:57]</a>. This willingness to understand and align with others, rather than being "bullheaded," leads to greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>.
*   **Self-Awareness and Continuous Improvement:** Building a muscle for self-reflection and asking "what could I have done better?" after every experience, project, or communication helps to continuously improve and earn trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>.

### Learning from Experience
Ian McAllister, reflecting on his time at Airbnb, identified a learning opportunity regarding trust. While working to scale the customer support technology platform, he focused heavily on analytics and prioritization. However, he realized he hadn't invested enough time in truly partnering with and building support from the customer support leadership team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:30">[01:35:30]</a>. This lack of full support, despite outward alignment, meant the strategy might not have been executed as well as it could have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>.

## Losing Trust
Trust can be lost through practices such as:
*   Lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>.
*   Being evasive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>.
*   Failing to ship what was promised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:14">[01:25:14]</a>.
*   Ignoring or repeating mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:16">[01:25:16]</a>.

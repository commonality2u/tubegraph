Linear, a B2B SaaS product, has achieved significant success, being described as one of the most beloved, beautifully designed, and fastest-growing products in its category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. Its success serves as an inspiration for companies aiming to build a much better version of an existing product and succeed despite inherent barriers to switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. A key indicator of their [[Product Market Fit and Growth Strategy | product-market fit]] is that many users express a strong desire to switch to Linear from competing products like Jira, if allowed by their IT departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Linear's inception was driven by the observation that existing tools made users "hate their day-to-day," contradicting the fun and enjoyment that originally drew people to technology and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

## Debunking the Speed-Quality Trade-off

A core belief at Linear, and a key factor in their effective [[Executing strategy effectively in product management | execution]], is the rejection of the idea that there's an inherent trade-off between speed and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. People often over-index on "rushing" or "being sloppy" when they think of speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Instead, speed should be viewed as a result of competence and expertise, much like a master craftsman's swift yet precise work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, supports this view, stating that the "good, cheap, fast, choose two" maxim is "devious misinformation spread by the slow," as "slow and expensive usually go together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

For Linear, speed means:
*   Having a workable solution within 10% of the allocated time budget (e.g., after week one) to test a key hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. This allows for rapid iteration and exploration of different variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.
*   The first version does not need to be perfect; the expectation is simply that it works to validate or invalidate major assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.
*   Relying on highly talented engineers who are comfortable making something workable even if it's not a "perfectionist" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

To implement this approach:
*   Embrace the attitude that the first version will not be perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. This makes it "cheaper" by reducing the need for pixel-perfect design or extensive UI bug fixes in early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.
*   Focus on delivering the smallest shippable (or learnable) element of working software that solves the core problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.
*   Gradually expand the circle of users for a new feature, starting with internal users, then beta customer groups, and finally general availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. This ensures real feedback and avoids wasting time [[strategies_for_building_products_at_large_companies | building things nobody wants or uses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>.

## Strategic Feature Prioritization: Avoiding Bloat

Linear consciously avoids the common fate of enterprise software becoming bloated by adopting a strict policy on feature requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>. They have a clear "no-go" category for requests that lead to "bloatedness," specifically:
*   **Customization features requested by middle managers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   These features often aim to make reporting easier, but at the cost of worsening the workflow for individual contributors (ICs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   Linear's core promise is not to make this particular trade-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

The rationale is that if the IC user experience is degraded, users will disengage, rendering any reporting data inaccurate and useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. While this means sometimes turning down deals, Linear's long-term strategy focuses on making teams more effective, which is what buyers ultimately care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. They aim to convince buyers that certain customization requests are actually the cause of their current "mess," rather than a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

More complicated debates about features often revolve around extending existing features versus adding new services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. These decisions are tied back to specific, real-life use cases of named individuals, not hypothetical personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. This pragmatic approach ensures that solutions are grounded in reality, even if reality isn't always "beautiful and elegant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Example: Custom Fields vs. Customer Requests
Linear found that 40% of requests for fully customized fields were driven by a need to track customer-specific needs (e.g., "Walmart asked for this feature") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Instead of building generic custom fields that would burden ICs with manual tagging, Linear developed a "customer requests" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. This feature automatically integrates feedback from customer support tools and CRMs, tagging engineering issues with the relevant customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This approach makes ICs' lives easier by providing context and solves the reporting need without increasing manual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## The Role of Empathy in Product Discovery

Nonan, Head of Product at Linear, emphasizes a deep, empathetic approach to customer calls. His goal is "to feel bad in the same way that customers feel bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This involves persistently digging with questions until the underlying emotional valence motivating a feature request is uncovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

For example, a user complaining about misalignment with marketing might be hiding the deeper frustration of a specific communication mishap that made them "feel really bad" and never wanting to put dates on things again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This deeper understanding led to Linear's project date feature, allowing flexible granularity (e.g., "Q4 project") to prevent false precision and miscommunication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

In competitive industries, obvious, goal-oriented problems are often already addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. The opportunity lies in exploring "emotional hooks" â€“ the subtle pain points users experience throughout their workday that they might not even consciously recognize ("schlep blindness," as coined by Paul Graham) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### Example: Triage Management
The "triage management" feature in Linear stemmed from addressing two emotional pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>:
1.  Users manually managing issue routing felt "totally underwater" due to the high number of touches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
2.  Teams receiving tickets felt overwhelmed and out of control, while those submitting tickets felt a lack of accountability and response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
Linear systemized and automated this process, alleviating the stress and improving communication flow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## Systematized Creativity and Product Ideation

To foster creativity and uncover non-obvious solutions, Linear employs a method of exploring "extreme" versions of a product or solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This involves asking: "How extreme can you take it?" or "What's the 11-star experience?" (a concept also used by Brian Chesky at Airbnb) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. This exercise pushes teams to discard practical constraints like cost and feasibility initially, exploring the full "possibility space" and breaking free from inherent, unconscious mental constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. The greatest risk in product decisions is not seeing the right choice at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

This extreme version is then built and tested quickly to gain deep insights into what works and what doesn't.

### Example: Saving Drafts
When designing a feature to save drafts for issues, Linear explored two extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>:
1.  **Fastest possible experience**: Users could save as a draft or simply close to discard, with no pop-ups or interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. *Result*: It felt "super unsafe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Safest possible experience**: Autosave everything immediately upon typing a single character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. *Result*: It felt safe but created a "paper trail" of unintended drafts (like "Untitled Document") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

The final solution balances these extremes:
*   For brand new issues, the user is prompted to save the draft upon closing, to ensure safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   For existing drafts being modified, autosave occurs automatically, as no new object is being created, avoiding clutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

This iterative process, moving from extreme to extreme, helped them find the optimal balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This method connects to the first principle of getting things out quickly, even if they are extreme versions that won't work long-term, because they provide valuable learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## B2B Software as a Teacher: The Linear Method

B2B software does more than just solve problems; it teaches users how to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Many B2B tools originate from internal processes that proved effective, which are then productized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. When a company adopts such a tool, they are not just buying software; they are adopting a set of best practices and a "baseline level of competency" in that domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

Linear has a very opinionated stance on how product teams should operate, reflected in their product. They avoid extensive customization requests because they believe their opinionated approach, based on observations of high-performing teams, leads to a better working experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This allows them to offer native features that provide a depth and quality that customization cannot achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## The "Double Triangle": Product as a Go-to-Market Discipline

Linear views product management as a go-to-market discipline, alongside sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. While the traditional "Triad" of engineering, product, and design is essential for [[strategies_for_building_products_at_large_companies | building products]], the collaboration between product, sales, and marketing is often "under-examined" and can even be antagonistic in other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

At Linear, Product Managers (PMs) bridge the gap between the "building side" (engineering, product, design) and the "selling side" (sales, marketing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This "double triangle" structure ensures that commercial motivations and goals are integrated into the product development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

Key aspects of this collaboration:
*   **Product Marketing Integration**: Linear has a full-time Product Marketer on the PM team responsible for crafting language for releases, change logs, and release notes, ensuring it resonates with their expert practitioner audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. PMs, with their deep understanding of customer language, originate the core messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Sales Validation**: Sales teams validate messaging in the field, providing direct feedback on its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.
*   **PM Involvement**: PMs should actively lean into the sales and marketing side of the business, engaging in sales calls, understanding how the product is sold, and ensuring the messaging is authentic to the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. This provides an opportunity for PMs to have a greater impact beyond just building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

## Mastering Deadlines

Linear views deadlines with extreme seriousness, but selectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>. The philosophy is:
*   **Few Deadlines**: Don't have too many deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.
*   **P-Zero Priority**: When a deadline exists, treat it as a "priority zero" problem. Everything else must become secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. This means engineers are not pulled onto other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>.
*   **PM's Role in Scope Cutting**: The PM's primary job is to cut as much scope as possible to ensure the deadline is hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>.
*   **Focus on Shippable Product**: The goal is to reach a point where a working product can be released, even if it doesn't include all desired features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

Deadlines are typically reserved for external marketing exercises or major launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. Missing a marketing communication opportunity is a lost chance that cannot be recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.

Linear does "almost no estimating" to hit deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. Instead, the focus is on shipping early, allowing subsequent time to be spent on iteration and polishing. This proactive approach ensures that by the time a go/no-go decision is made, there is a functional product that can be released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.

The process of setting and achieving goals in product management often faces significant [[common_challenges_faced_by_product_teams_and_how_to_overcome_them | challenges]], particularly regarding the commitment to specific outcomes and the understanding of underlying drivers.

## Traditional Goal Setting Pitfalls
Companies often struggle with OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) because of an overemphasis on "outcomes over outputs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. While Product Managers (PMs) ultimately need to measure their success based on valuable business outcomes, it's not always appropriate to commit to a specific outcome if the team doesn't yet understand how to influence it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>. This can lead to teams "throwing spaghetti against the wall" without clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

## The Frontier of Understanding
A key framework for understanding goal-setting [[challenges_and_strategies_in_product_management | challenges and strategies]] is the "Frontier of Understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. This concept helps identify the primary risk a team faces when trying to achieve a goal, which in turn informs the most appropriate type of goal to set.

There are four types of risk that define this frontier:

1.  **Understanding Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>: This occurs when the team wants to achieve something but doesn't understand the levers to pull.
    *   **Challenge**: If you don't understand what moves a particular metric (e.g., retention), committing to a retention goal means blindly trying things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.
    *   **Solution**: The goal should be to increase understanding, not directly move the metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>. This involves customer conversations, analysis, and forming strong hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.

2.  **Dependency Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>: The team understands the potential levers but lacks the necessary tools or resources to make progress.
    *   **Challenge**: Even with a clear path, external dependencies can hinder execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

3.  **Execution Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>: The team has resources and strong hypotheses but may or may not be able to execute against them effectively.
    *   **Solution**: Set an execution goal (e.g., "hit 20 experiments this quarter") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. Hitting these targets signifies strong execution, even if the experiments don't always yield the desired outcome, as it still moves the frontier forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

4.  **Strategic Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>: The team has a hypothesis and executes well, but the hypothesis itself turns out to be incorrect.
    *   **Challenge**: Sometimes, the underlying strategy or assumptions are flawed, leading to missed goals despite diligent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.

### Communicating Challenges to Leadership
When a team misses a goal, it's crucial to convey the learning and provide a clear path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. Leadership is outcome-driven and values confidence in hitting those outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. By articulating where the "frontier of understanding" lies and how the team plans to move it forward, PMs can gain leadership's support for more exploratory, understanding-focused goals.

### The Goal Success Matrix
A 2x2 matrix can illustrate a team's situation regarding goals:
*   **Upper Right Quadrant**: Hit goals and know why. This is the ideal state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.
*   **Hit Goals, Don't Know Why**: Good in the short term, but will eventually catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.
*   **Didn't Hit Goals, But Know Why**: Important for learning and making progress on understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.
*   **Didn't Hit Goals, Don't Know Why**: The least desirable position, indicating a lack of learning and effectiveness.

Many of these concepts are explored in Ravi Mehta's article on the Reforge blog, "A Better Goal with NTS (Not OKRs)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>.

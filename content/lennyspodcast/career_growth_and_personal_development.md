Andrew "Boz" Bosworth, Chief Technology Officer of Meta, joined Facebook as one of its earliest engineers in early 2006. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> During his 18-year tenure, he has been instrumental in creating some of the most impactful products in internet history, including the Facebook News Feed, the original Facebook mobile ads platform, the messaging system, profile, timeline, Facebook groups, and the internal engineering boot camp. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> In 2017, he founded the company's AR/VR organization, now known as Reality Labs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

## Early Career Realities at Facebook

### The Unromanticized Grind
As one of the first engineers at Facebook, Bosworth describes the early days as a period of "pain and suffering" that movies don't typically portray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He didn't sleep more than four hours at a time for about two years, waking up every four hours to check reports for site attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He worked 120 hours per week, had no hobbies, and sacrificed much of his 20s in terms of social life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. While his efforts "paid off," he acknowledges that many others make similar sacrifices without the same success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Startup culture is healthy for those willing to take the risk, but it is "not glamorous" in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Lack of Support and Resources
In the early 2000s, there was no readily available expert to consult when problems arose; engineers had to figure things out themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Basic corporate functions like payroll, finance, IT, and HR were not professionally handled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Engineers might have to buy components, build new servers, and physically rack them at a colo (colocation facility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

> "People really undervalue the fact that when you go to work even a moderate midsize Corporation today, especially with the tremendous growth of startups supporting startups, things like payroll and finance and it and HR and you know these things are professionally handled in many cases, that was just not the case in the early 2000s." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>

## Leveraging Leadership and Communication

### Asking for Help
A crucial piece of [[career_development_and_advice | career advice]] Bosworth often gives is to "more directly leverage their leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. People often hesitate to ask for help, fearing it signals incompetence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. However, the job is not always to do it yourself, but to "get it done" effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Managers want their team members to succeed because it makes their own lives easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

When asking for help, Bosworth recommends framing it clearly, for example: "Hey, I'm making progress on this, this is what I'm blocked on, this is the current program." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a> A simple, tight email with a "no response required" option can keep a manager informed without burdening them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. When truly blocked, providing specific questions or even a draft email for the manager to send can make it "super cheap" for them to assist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

### Communication as the Job
Bosworth firmly believes that "communication is the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a> for anyone aspiring to have an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>. Ideas or written posts that don't "break through" are the communicator's responsibility, not the audience's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. He adopts "extreme ownership" by asking what he could have done differently in his communication when things go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>. This includes setting priorities, expectations, or metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>. Even organizational charts are seen as communication devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.

> "You cannot not communicate. You are always communicating something with your face, with your clothes, with your body." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>

Effective communication involves:
*   **Multimodality:** Repeating points in different ways (e.g., all-hands meeting followed by a written post) to ensure internalization by various audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.
*   **Addressing fears:** Starting by acknowledging potential issues or concerns to build trust and ensure the audience is receptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.
*   **Empathy for the audience:** Understanding their current mental model, crafting language, presence, and persona to guide them towards the desired understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>.

### Listening and Empathy
Beyond speaking, Bosworth also emphasizes "listening is the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>. His biggest professional regrets stem from not being kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>, realizing that kindness is about delivering feedback productively and helpfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. This extends to personal relationships, where understanding a partner's perspective is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>. He believes that insights from parenting literature about managing emotions can make one a better manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.

A key lesson from observing a colleague, Ami Vora, was the power of "genuine and profound curiosity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a>. Instead of reacting defensively to disagreement, Vora would respond with "fascinating, you have to tell me more about why you think that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>. This approach tears down walls and fosters open-mindedness, even if the other person's view is ultimately proven wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>. Embracing curiosity in moments of challenge has "completely changed his life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:35">[01:29:35]</a>.

## Navigating Career Paths and Passion

### Embracing Different Roles
Bosworth's [[career_development_and_planning | career path]] has been unusual, often changing jobs every six months early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. He moved from integrity work to News Feed, then to site speed and infrastructure, boot camp, messaging, and groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. While peers might have been promoted faster in single tracks, his varied experience allowed him to understand different dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>. This broad exposure helped his [[career_development_and_progression_strategies | career progression]] take a "vertical" trajectory once he settled into the ads role for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.

### Optimizing for Learning
His core advice for early [[career_development_and_planning | career development]] is to "optimize for learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. He moved when he felt he "wasn't learning enough" or was bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. He suggests jumping into new things, giving them six months, and if it doesn't work out, recognizing that new skills were still built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. This approach builds a valuable variety of experience over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.

### Finding Your Passion
Bosworth believes that when you're passionate about something, you do "better work," "smarter work," and become "an order of magnitude more productive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. Initially, he had a strong identity as an "AI infrastructure product guy" and resisted working on ads or hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. However, he learned that he's "a guy who gets excited about things" once he dives in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. He now gives himself space to see if he can become passionate about a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. If passion isn't found after about six months, he moves on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

## Lessons from Successes and Failures

### Building the News Feed: Conviction and User Behavior
The Facebook News Feed, a pioneering algorithmic content feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>, was initially controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. Users "did not want it" but "immediately doubled their usage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. This taught Bosworth about having "conviction" in what you're building and recognizing the difference between "stated preferences" and "revealed preferences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. He emphasizes that the lesson is not to ignore customers, but to understand whether the core idea is wrong versus if the details of execution are flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

The News Feed, along with ads, has generated over a trillion dollars in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>, which Bosworth correlates with human utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.

### Personal Failures and Growth
Bosworth states he has "failed tons of times" in product building and technical architecture, but he doesn't regret most of these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:53">[01:20:53]</a>. They served as learning opportunities or helped recognize unworkable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>.

His true regrets are "personal failures" where he negatively affected another person, often due to a lack of emotional control or feeling "identity threat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>. He shares a vivid example of a heated argument with a colleague about technical encoding choices, where his identity was caught up in "being right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:36">[01:24:36]</a>. This embarrassing incident, witnessed by many, was a key step in recontextualizing himself away from needing to be right, towards being open-minded and curious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>.

## Trusting Yourself: A Life Motto

Bosworth's family motto is "trust yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:32">[01:36:32]</a>. He believes that much of his success, and that of others in startups, came from having faith in his own decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:26">[01:37:26]</a>. This "conviction" is essential for making big, controversial changes or expensive decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:33">[01:37:33]</a>. It means trusting your own observations and intellect over external narratives, like media criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:48">[01:37:48]</a>.

> "You have to believe that your eyes ears and an intellect have combined to give you a point of view that has intrinsic value and deserves your respect." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39">[01:37:39]</a>

Trusting yourself also means being willing to take risks, confident that you can handle the outcome even if they don't pay off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The [[understanding_personal_and_career_fulfillment | work of improving yourself]] is always fruitful, satisfying, and beneficial in all aspects of life: family, friends, and professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:22">[01:29:22]</a>.

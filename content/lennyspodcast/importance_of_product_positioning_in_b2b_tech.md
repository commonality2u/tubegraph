From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

[[Understanding product positioning | Product positioning]] is a foundational marketing concept that defines how a product is the best in the world at delivering specific value to a well-defined set of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[12:52]</a>. While the concept has existed since the 1980s, its definition is often misunderstood or stretched in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[54:47]</a>.

Good positioning is essential for the success of B2B tech companies because it helps buyers understand the product's value and differentiate it from alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[18:41]</a>.

## What is Product Positioning?

According to April Dunford, best-selling author of *Obviously Awesome* and an expert in [[understanding_product_positioning | product positioning]] for B2B tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:56]</a>, [[understanding_product_positioning | positioning]] encompasses several key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[13:09]</a>:
*   **Alternatives** What are the alternatives to your product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[13:11]</a>
*   **Differentiation** How is your product different? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[13:13]</a>
*   **Value** What unique value can your product deliver that no other product can? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[13:16]</a>
*   **Target Audience** Who cares a lot about that unique value (who are you trying to target)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[13:21]</a>
*   **Market Category** What market do you intend to win? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[13:26]</a>

## Importance of Strong Positioning

### Resonating with Buyers
For B2B tech companies, especially those selling deeply technical products, the true measure of good positioning is whether it resonates with target buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:33]</a>. It's not about whether a non-expert, like your grandmother, understands it, but whether the intended buyer lands on your page and thinks, "Oh yeah, I get what this is, and that seems like a thing I should have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[20:22]</a>.

### Impact on Product Success
If a product isn't performing well, the issue may not be the product itself but its positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:44]</a>. When positioning is done correctly, it can lead to significant success and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[05:27]</a>. Conversely, poor positioning can negatively affect every stage of the sales pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[09:50]</a>.

### Clarity and Simplicity
Effective positioning makes your product's purpose feel obvious and simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[17:50]</a>. For example, Postman, an API platform, successfully positioned itself as an "API platform for building and using APIs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[18:11]</a>. This clear statement makes it evident to their target audience that such a tool is a necessity for serious API development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[18:47]</a>.

### Facilitating Customer Decision-Making
Customers in B2B markets, especially for enterprise software, often need to justify their purchase decisions internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[37:28]</a>. Strong positioning helps them understand why your solution is the best fit for their specific needs, enabling them to confidently advocate for it to stakeholders. Without this clarity, deals often result in "no decision," where customers default to their existing, often inefficient, status quo (e.g., spreadsheets) because they can't differentiate options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[38:15]</a>. Approximately 40% of B2B deals are lost to "no decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[24:26]</a>.

### Internal Alignment
A common cause of weak positioning is a lack of alignment across different departments within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[13:52]</a>. When the founder, marketing team, sales team, and [[role_of_product_managers_in_tech_companies | product team]] all have slightly different ideas about the product's positioning, it creates confusion. To rectify this, positioning should be a collaborative "team sport" involving marketing, product, sales, customer success, and executive leadership (especially the CEO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[14:45]</a>. This ensures everyone is "singing the same song" and can execute the positioning consistently <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[15:28]</a>.

### Foundation for Marketing and Sales
[[Differences between positioning and messaging | Positioning]] serves as a fundamental input for all marketing and sales activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[41:38]</a>. You cannot effectively write messaging or develop a brand identity until you understand your target buyer and your product's differentiation and value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[40:53]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_signs_of_weak_product_positioning | Challenges and Signs of Weak Product Positioning]]

Identifying weak positioning can be challenging because there isn't a single metric to track it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[09:34]</a>. Instead, it manifests in various symptoms across the business:
*   **Sluggishness in Marketing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[10:00]</a>
*   **Longer Sales Cycles** The "light" of understanding doesn't come on for prospects until several calls with a sales representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[10:06]</a>.
*   **High Churn** Customers might buy the product but churn quickly because it doesn't meet their expectations or needs, indicating a mismatch between what was sold and what was delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[10:21]</a>.
*   **Sales Call Confusion** During initial sales calls, prospects might say:
    *   "Huh, could you just say that again? Could you just back up at the beginning and do that thing from the beginning?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[11:23]</a> (Confusion)
    *   "Yeah, I get it, you're just like Salesforce." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[11:40]</a> (Misidentification)
    *   "I totally get what you do, I just don't get why anyone would pay for that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[11:52]</a> (Lack of perceived value)

### Historical Examples of Weak Positioning
*   **Magic Leap** Initially launched with "mind-blowing tech" but lacked a clear target market and value proposition beyond "it's cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[42:02]</a>. They later tightened their positioning to B2B use cases in manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[43:01]</a>.
*   **Google Glass** Faced similar issues, with the public understanding "what it is" but not "why do we need one of those" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[43:19]</a>. It also eventually found more specific B2B applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[43:36]</a>.
*   **Segway** Positioned as a "revolution in human transport," the immense hype led to disappointment when it was revealed to be a two-wheeled scooter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[44:00]</a>. Its refusal to position at a micro-level, answering "who's this for and why do they care," left customers confused about where to even use it (road or sidewalk), leading to its commercial failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[45:17]</a>.

## [[steps_to_develop_and_align_on_product_positioning | Steps to Develop and Align on Product Positioning]]

April Dunford's methodology for developing strong B2B product positioning focuses on objective analysis rather than internal opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[23:16]</a>:

1.  **Competitive Alternatives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[23:41]</a>
    *   Identify "what you have to beat to win a deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[23:38]</a>.
    *   This includes direct competitors (who else is on the short list) and the "status quo" (what the company is currently doing, even if it's manual, like spreadsheets or pen and paper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[23:59]</a>. Ignoring the status quo is a common mistake, as ~40% of B2B deals are lost to "no decision" (i.e., status quo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[24:24]</a>.

2.  **Differentiated Capabilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[25:02]</a>
    *   List all features, functions, or company capabilities (e.g., pricing, professional services) that your product has that alternatives do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[25:12]</a>.

3.  **Value Themes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[25:32]</a>
    *   Translate each differentiated capability into a clear "so what" for the customer, articulating the value it enables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[25:36]</a>.
    *   This process typically results in two or three core value buckets or themes that are genuinely differentiated, unlike generic values that any competitor could claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[25:49]</a>.

4.  **Best-Fit Customers (Target Accounts)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[26:20]</a>
    *   Determine the characteristics of target accounts that would most deeply care about your unique value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[26:29]</a>. This includes firmographics (company size, revenue, geography) and other actionable criteria like specific software usage, team structures, or budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[56:27]</a>.
    *   In B2B, the most important persona is the "champion"—the individual responsible for researching and advocating for a solution internally and getting consensus across stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. Positioning must resonate with this champion to even get on a short list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

5.  **Market Category** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[26:44]</a>
    *   Define the market context in which your product makes its differentiated value obvious to your target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[27:06]</a>. This step comes last, as it's informed by the previous steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[26:47]</a>.

### Output
The output of this process is not just a document of bullet points, but a strategic sales narrative that translates the positioning into a compelling story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[34:01]</a>. This narrative can be storyboarded and then developed into an actual pitch deck, demo, and script that the sales team can use and that everyone across the company can consistently articulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[35:01]</a>.

### Example: Help Scout
Help Scout, a customer success software company, operates in a competitive market dominated by Zendesk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[29:50]</a>.
1.  **Alternatives:** Zendesk, other customer service software, and the status quo like email or rudimentary shared inboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[29:57]</a>.
2.  **Differentiated Capabilities:** Features centered on delivering "amazing service" like a proper service-oriented shared inbox, assigning a person (not a ticket number), and chat bots that only appear when a human is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[30:40]</a>.
3.  **Value Themes:** Deepening customer relationships and driving growth through customer loyalty, treating customers like people rather than just reducing costs through low-cost channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[31:28]</a>.
4.  **Best-Fit Customers:** Direct-to-consumer (DTC) or e-commerce brands that view customer service as a growth driver, not just a cost center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[32:17]</a>. They explicitly exclude companies (like some phone companies) that prioritize cost reduction over relationship building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[31:55]</a>.
5.  **Sales Narrative:** Help Scout's story emphasizes that for modern e-commerce companies, customer success is a growth driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[33:08]</a>. They contrast this with alternatives that treat customers like numbers and prioritize cost reduction, highlighting their unique approach that treats customers as individuals to foster loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[33:25]</a>.

## When to Address Positioning

[[Understanding product positioning | Positioning]] is not a static concept; it evolves as the product and market change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[19:01]</a>. Regular check-ins are valuable to ensure it remains optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[19:24]</a>.

### Early Stage Companies
For very early-stage companies or new products, it's often more effective to have a "positioning thesis" rather than a rigid, "over-tightened" positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[50:01]</a>. This thesis is an internal alignment on assumptions about competitors, differentiation, value, target audience, and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[50:11]</a>. It's acknowledged that this thesis will likely be "partially incorrect" because it's based on assumptions, not market data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[50:48]</a>.

In these early stages, it's better to keep the positioning "a little bit loose" to allow the market to pull the product in unexpected directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[51:08]</a>. For example, a "tuna fishing net" (product) might be discovered by fishermen to be "amazing for grouper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[52:04]</a>.

### Transitioning to Tight Positioning
The transition from loose to tight positioning occurs when a clear pattern emerges in who loves the product and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[52:49]</a>. This could be consistent firmographic data (e.g., companies of a certain size, using a specific software) or a recurring positive response during sales pitches. Once this pattern "starts to come into focus," the company is ready to "smash your foot on the gas" and aggressively target that specific market segment where they know they can win consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[53:43]</a>.

## [[differences_between_positioning_and_messaging | Positioning vs. Messaging vs. Branding]]

*   **Positioning** is a strategic concept that defines "how we win in the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[40:48]</a>. It's the fundamental input for messaging and branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[40:27]</a>.
*   **Messaging** is the articulation of that positioning, often in the form of text on a homepage or specific value propositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[40:30]</a>. It cannot be effectively written without a clear understanding of the target audience and differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[40:53]</a>.
*   **Branding** defines what a company's brand stands for. Like messaging, it requires a clear understanding of positioning, including target buyers and differentiation, to ensure the brand is distinct and resonates with the intended audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[41:21]</a>.

## [[b2b_growth_strategies | B2B Growth Strategies]]: Segmentation vs. Personas

*   **Segmentation** is how a market is divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[55:22]</a>. In B2B, segmentation typically uses firmographics (company size, revenue, geography) or specific actionable criteria like a company's tech stack, team size, or budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[56:27]</a>. This allows for targeted marketing campaigns and sales lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[57:01]</a>.
*   **Personas** describe the characteristics of a particular type of buyer, including their hopes, dreams, fears, and motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[55:51]</a>. In B2B, a typical purchase process involves 5-7 individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[58:15]</a>. However, the most crucial persona is the "champion"—the individual responsible for researching, evaluating, and advocating for a solution internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. If the positioning doesn't resonate with the champion, the deal will likely not even make it to a short list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. While other personas exist, marketing teams should prioritize developing and arming the champion to sell the solution internally to other stakeholders (e.g., IT, legal, economic buyer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>. Creating extensive, detailed personas for every stakeholder involved in a B2B deal is often an inefficient use of marketing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.

The Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework is a foundational concept in product development and innovation, co-created by Bob Moesta and Clay Christensen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Its core premise is that people "hire" products and services to make progress in their lives, rather than simply "buying" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Understanding JTBD means looking beyond product features to comprehend the underlying context and desired outcomes that drive customer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Core Principles

The framework shifts the perspective from a "supply side" view (what products compete based on technology or business model) to a "demand side" view (what truly competes for a customer's attention based on their needs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

A key principle is that "a struggling moment causes demand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This means that products should be designed to address specific pain points or aspirations within a particular context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This focus on "struggling moments" can inform a product roadmap, moving beyond just features to address underlying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Instead of "pain and gain," the framework emphasizes "context and outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. Often, seemingly irrational behavior becomes rational when the full context is understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>. The goal is to understand the "vector of progress or intention" that drives a customer's decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.

### The Four Forces Model
The "Four Forces" model explains the dynamics of customer behavior when considering a new product or service:
*   **Push (F1)**: The dissatisfaction or struggle with the current situation or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Pull (F2)**: The attraction of a new product or an imagined improved outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Anxiety (F3)**: Concerns about the new product, the transition, or potential negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Habit of the Present (F4)**: The inertia of staying with the familiar old product or behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Customers will only switch if the combined "push" and "pull" forces are greater than the "anxiety" and "habit of the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This means reducing friction and anxiety can be as important as adding new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

There are three types of energy that drive these forces:
*   **Functional Energy**: Time, space, effort, knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.
*   **Emotional Energy**: How a person feels (e.g., frustrated, overlooked) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.
*   **Social Energy**: How a person wants to be perceived by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.

## Application and Examples
Instead of trying to "sell" people, the JTBD framework focuses on enabling them to "buy" by understanding their buying process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This often involves segmenting the sales process based on the customer's "timeline of buying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

Common examples used to illustrate JTBD include:
*   **Snickers vs. Milky Way**: While both are candy bars, a Snickers is "hired" when someone has missed a meal and needs quick energy to get back to work (competing with protein drinks or coffee). A Milky Way is "hired" after an emotional experience, for comfort (competing with wine or a brownie) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)**: By studying "anomalies" who were paying for school but attending online, SNHU realized these older students had a different job: returning to school to gain responsibility after prior attempts failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This insight led to SNHU becoming one of the largest universities, serving over 200,000 students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Autobooks**: This company helps banks offer invoicing (like Square or PayPal). By analyzing the buying process of banks and small businesses, they found distinct phases (first thought, passive looking, active looking, deciding, first use, ongoing use). Tailoring demos to these phases (e.g., stories, alternatives, choices) significantly increased conversion and shortened the sales cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Intercom**: [[examples_of_successful_jobs_to_be_done_applications_in_companies | Intercom]] identified that customers "hired" their product for four distinct jobs (e.g., customer acquisition, support). They then customized pricing and features by turning off irrelevant options for each job, allowing them to compete effectively with different rivals like HubSpot and Zendesk, leading to significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

The framework is also useful for [[understanding_work_for_product_development | understanding work for product development]], especially for zero-to-one products. It identifies what customers will "fire" (stop using) when a new product comes out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.

## Interviewing for JTBD
Interviewing customers to uncover their jobs requires specific techniques:
*   **Focus on the "Why"**: Ask what happened to make them say "today's the day" they needed a product, rather than asking about the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.
*   **Interview Recent Purchasers**: Focus on people who recently made a choice, as they can accurately recount the story of why they bought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
*   **Talk to Churned Customers**: Those who left a product are still trying to make progress and can provide insights into their struggling moments and what changed their context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.
*   **Avoid Discussion Guides**: Rigid question sets can hinder discovery. Instead, use the pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits framework as a guide to explore their story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.
*   **Use Interrogation Techniques**: Similar to criminal interrogation, encourage people to elaborate by mirroring, playing things back incorrectly, or bracketing options to elicit more detailed responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Trust Stated Intentions**: People often misremember or rationalize their buying decisions (e.g., saying they bought a car for a "deal" when it was actually due to mechanical failures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>. Focus on what they *did*, not what they *say* they want or will do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.
*   **Small Sample Sizes**: Causation and set theory suggest that patterns in pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits often repeat after about 7-8 interviews. Bob Moesta typically conducts 10-12 interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Identify Hiring and Firing Criteria**: Uncover the trade-offs and decisions customers make when choosing to adopt or abandon a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

## Different Approaches to JTBD
While the core idea is shared, there are different interpretations and methodologies:
*   **Bob Moesta & Clay Christensen's Approach**: This approach, deeply qualitative and organic, focuses on understanding the underlying causality and transformation from a struggling moment. It's often applied in startup and new-to-the-world contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. It emphasizes that only *people* have jobs, not products or organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Tony Ulwick's Approach**: This methodology, referred to as "Outcome-Driven Innovation," is often more quantitative and supply-side driven. It asks what jobs a *product* can do and where it can be better, using a systematic, prescriptive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.
*   [[challenges_and_misconceptions_in_implementing_jobs_to_be_done | Misconceptions]]: A major pitfall is "sitting in a conference room and hypothesizing what the jobs are" without actually talking to customers and observing their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.

## When JTBD is Not a Good Fit
JTBD may be less effective in situations where:
*   **No Real Choice**: If customers have very limited or no choice in a product or service (e.g., health insurance dictated by an employer), the "job" of choosing is less prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
*   **Deep-Seated Habits**: For products that are part of unconscious, deeply ingrained habits (e.g., chewing gum), customers may not be able to articulate the "job" because they don't consciously process the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. The job is only revealed when they change their habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

## Benefits and Takeaways
*   **Identifies True Competition**: JTBD helps identify a product's real competitors from the customer's perspective, which might be very different from typical industry classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Drives Innovation**: Innovation occurs by studying what causes people to change their behavior and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.
*   **Prioritization**: Understanding the "struggling moments" allows teams to prioritize effectively, often by choosing what *not* to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.
*   **Matches Customer Values**: Success comes from aligning a product's trade-offs with the customer's desired trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.
*   **Beyond Features**: It moves thinking beyond simply adding features to understanding the customer's context and desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

For those interested in learning more, Bob Moesta recommends his book, *Demandside Sales*, which frames the method around helping people buy rather than trying to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

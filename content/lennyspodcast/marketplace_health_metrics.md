When evaluating the [[design_and_operation_of_online_marketplaces | health of a marketplace]], certain metrics are more helpful than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

## Core Business Health Metrics

Two fundamental metrics are crucial for understanding any business, including marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>:

1.  **Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) or Transactions**: This metric combines both the supply and demand sides of the marketplace to ensure it is functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. It typically serves as the ultimate North Star metric that everything else flatters up to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
2.  **Unit Economics**: A deep understanding of unit economics is vital, as marketplaces often have poor or even negative unit economics in their early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. For example, Instacart famously lost money on every order, and Uber lost money on every drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. Understanding the components that contribute to unit economics is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

## Marketplace-Specific Metrics

Beyond the general business metrics, two nuanced metrics are particularly important for marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>:

### Liquidity

Liquidity broadly refers to how reliable the marketplace is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. It measures how often a consumer looking for something, or a supplier looking to sell something, can successfully complete their desired action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

*   **Expression**: Ideally, this metric is expressed in a way that reflects what the customer truly cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.
    *   For ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft, "wait time" is a classic example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. As more supply (drivers) is added, the average wait time decreases, reaching a "magic moment" where the service significantly improves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
    *   For e-commerce marketplaces, it's typically a conversion rate or "search to fill" metric, indicating how often a user can find and purchase what they're looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   **Importance**: Until a marketplace achieves liquidity, little else truly matters, making it the primary focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: This is why advice for marketplaces often includes cutting scope down to a specific geography or category, to focus on generating liquidity in that confined area before scaling elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

### Share of Wallet

[[Indicators and metrics for productmarket fit progression | Share of wallet]] measures the percentage of a buyer's total spend on a given category that occurs on your marketplace, or conversely, how much of a seller's business comes through your platform versus alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.

*   **Examples**:
    *   For Uber drivers, it's the percentage of their driving hours spent on Uber versus Lyft or DoorDash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.
    *   For a retailer on Fair, it's the percentage of products on their shelf that came from Fair versus other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Increased Lifetime Value (LTV)**: As share of wallet goes up, LTV increases, leading to a much better business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.
    *   **Reduced Multi-tenancy**: A higher share of wallet makes it less likely for a customer to "multi-tenant" (use another marketplace or service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Ideally, customers commit to using only one marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
    *   **Depth over Breadth**: Prioritizing depth of engagement over sheer breadth of users indicates a stronger, more defensible marketplace for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.
*   **Challenges**: Achieving high share of wallet on both sides of the marketplace simultaneously is often very difficult, requiring a strategic choice of which side to prioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
*   **[[Differences between consumer and B2B marketplaces | B2B vs. Consumer]]**: While some form of share of wallet can almost always be measured on the supply side of a marketplace (even if it's a pseudo-business consumer), it's typically a cleaner metric on the consumer side for [[Differences between consumer and B2B marketplaces | B2B marketplaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Related Strategic Considerations

### [[Supply vs demand focus in marketplaces | Supply vs Demand Focus]]

While both sides are important and cannot be ignored, advice often over-rotates on supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

*   **Why Supply is Overemphasized Early**:
    *   Supply *is* the product early on; without enough supply, there's nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.
    *   The supply side often uses the product more deeply, requiring more product resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>.
*   **Why Demand is Paramount**: Ultimately, demand is the only thing that truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. A marketplace that successfully aggregates demand in its industry will be the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. If a supplier is offered a customer at a profitable rate, they will almost always accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.
*   **The Nuance**: While prioritizing the customer experience, it may still be necessary to spend significant time acquiring hard-to-acquire supply to ensure customer happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. Supply should only be acquired to the extent that it positively impacts demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>.
*   **[[Balancing Customer Focus and Business Metrics | ROI Models]]**: Building dual-sided ROI equations that capture the marketplace dynamic can allow for pushing acquisition on either side to a comfortable payback period, somewhat mitigating the need to constantly monitor strict marketplace balance ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. An exception is extreme low supply/demand scenarios that could lead to negative externalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.

### Fragmentation

Fragmentation measures the number of businesses in a space relative to its transaction volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. If a small percentage of suppliers accounts for a large percentage of total volume, the market is less fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>.

*   **Impact on Marketplaces**: Low fragmentation poses a challenge because large, concentrated players have more leverage, are less likely to need the marketplace, and are less willing to pay high commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
*   **Disintermediation Risk**: High transaction values in less fragmented markets also increase the likelihood of disintermediation, where suppliers and customers bypass the marketplace to save on commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>. For example, a multi-thousand-dollar transaction fee would make it attractive for parties to transact directly, unlike a small ride-sharing commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.

### Evolution of Marketplaces

Marketplaces are evolving, generally moving towards charging higher commissions by doing more work to justify those fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.

*   **Marketplace 1.0 (Lead Generation)**: Early marketplaces like Zillow and HomeAdvisor primarily aggregated demand, acting as lead generators with relatively low commission rates (e.g., 5-10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>.
*   **Managed Marketplaces (Trust)**: Newer marketplaces like Airbnb or Etsy added a fundamental layer of trust and safety to transactions. This required significant work to ensure transactions were trustworthy, justifying higher commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>.
*   **Heavily Managed Marketplaces (Value Chain Integration)**: The latest evolution involves marketplaces taking over distinct parts of the value chain beyond simply aggregating demand. DoorDash and Instacart, for instance, own logistics, allowing them to charge more by making the service more reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. Fair, for example, underwrites transactions, taking on financial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.
*   **Potential for Non-Marketplace Evolution**: Eventually, some marketplaces may evolve out of the marketplace model entirely, especially those in industries where commoditization is desired (e.g., consistent quality in ride-sharing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. If a company begins to own the supply or eliminates the direct transaction between supply and demand (like Opendoor), it's no longer a marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>.
*   **Enduring Marketplace Model**: Marketplaces will likely persist in industries where "creativity" or the unique offerings of diverse suppliers are paramount, such as Etsy, Amazon (for unique products), or gaming platforms like Steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. These rely on external suppliers to bring amazing, creative new things that large companies are typically bad at providing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>.

Jessica Lax, Vice President of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, has built one of the largest and most impactful data teams in Tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. She has been with DoorDash for over 10 years, serving as the first General Manager responsible for launching new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Prior to DoorDash, Jessica founded a social gifting startup, GS Simple, and began her career in investment banking at Lehman Brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

## Philosophy of Analytics

Jessica believes analytics should be a business impact-driving function, not merely a service function that answers questions or builds dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The goal is not just to understand "why" something is happening, but "so what?"â€”what action should be taken now that the information is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Data teams should identify opportunities, offer a point of view on decisions, and proactively bring insights to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. They act as thought partners to product, engineering, and operations counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Data Team Structure: Centralized Model

Jessica advocates for a centralized data organization, or "Center of Excellence," rather than embedding analytics professionals directly into business units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. While Business Leaders might prefer embedded teams for control and camaraderie, a centralized model can achieve similar benefits while offering significant advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

At DoorDash, the central analytics team is divided into pods that perfectly map to product, engineering, operations, and marketing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This means team members are de facto embedded with their partner teams, fostering ownership and camaraderie, while still reporting up through a central organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Critically, the analytics team shares the same goals as their partner teams, ensuring incentives are aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Benefits of a Centralized Data Org

*   **Consistent and High Talent Bar:** A centralized team ensures a consistent bar for evaluating technical and soft skills, leading to higher quality hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Growth Opportunities:** Centralization provides clear career paths and growth opportunities. Individuals are not siloed within a single business unit and can move to different areas of the company to explore new problems or management roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This helps retain talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Consistency of Methodologies and Metrics:** Prevents different teams from defining the same metrics (e.g., "sales") differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. It allows for the improvement of methodologies with broader input and avoids redundant work (e.g., building the same churn prediction model six times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Scalability:** Identifying common problems across different parts of the business becomes easier, allowing for automation or improvements that benefit the entire organization as it scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Team Culture and Brand:** Fosters a strong team culture of learning and sharing, where members can collaborate, peer-review work, and find like-minded "data nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Prioritizing Work: Balancing Proactive and Reactive

Data teams face the challenge of balancing proactive exploratory work with reactive requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Jessica emphasizes that it requires intentional effort to carve out time for deep dives and self-directed work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

*   **Set Goals for Insights:** Establish goals for the team around finding insights through self-directed work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Hackathons:** Organize hackathons to dedicate time for exploring interesting problems and identifying new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. These deep dives have historically driven future roadmaps and generated significant insights, like uncovering fraud in DoorDash's referral program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Communication of Trade-offs:** When new requests come in, especially from junior team members, transparently communicate the trade-offs with current priorities. Asking, "Is this more important than these other three things I was going to work on?" helps stakeholders understand the impact of their requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. This allows for constant re-evaluation of prioritization with business partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Building Goodwill:** Sometimes, quickly completing a small request can build goodwill with partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.
*   **Prove Value:** Consistently demonstrating the value of longer-term, proactive work (e.g., discovering new opportunities) helps justify dedicating time to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

## Hiring for Data Teams

Beyond technical skills, which are table stakes, Jessica looks for unique characteristics in top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>:

*   **Curiosity:** The ability to be self-motivated and "pull on threads" when something seems unusual, rather than just answering a question and stopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. This can be tested by presenting cases with subtle errors or asking for examples of proactive investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solving & Ambiguity Tolerance:** Using real-world business cases in interviews helps assess how candidates break down problems, handle ambiguity, and adjust their thinking when presented with new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   **Point of View & Decision-Making:** Candidates should be able to make a decision or offer a point of view, even with incomplete information, demonstrating their ability to act in real-world scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.
*   **Diverse Backgrounds:** Jessica herself has a non-traditional background (art, investment banking, GM) and advocates for hiring individuals from various fields (engineering, operations, marketing, finance, consulting, statistics, economics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. This creates a unique environment where people teach each other, leading to a "net importer of talent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. Diversity in prior company size and stage also helps the team foresee and address future challenges as the business scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

## Defining and Aligning Metrics

Metrics are crucial for aligning incentives and driving outcomes. Lessons learned include:

*   **Short-term Proxies for Long-term Outcomes:** Identify measurable short-term "inputs" that drive long-term outputs. For example, instead of directly "goaling" on retention (which is hard to move quickly), focus on inputs that experimentation shows drive retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.
*   **Keep it Simple:** Avoid complex composite metrics that nobody truly understands. Even if a composite metric is "more perfect" scientifically, a simpler, intuitively understood metric is far more effective for driving real outcomes across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. For instance, DoorDash moved away from a complex "Merchant Health Score" to focusing on simpler, actionable metrics like "Merchants getting an order within 7 days" and "Merchant photo coverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
*   **Common Currency for Trade-offs:** Quantify different business levers (e.g., price changes, delivery times, new restaurant acquisition, Dasher mobilization) in terms of a common currency, like Gross Order Value (GOV) or volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. This allows for informed trade-offs across different teams (e.g., marketing vs. logistics) and faster, better decisions on where to allocate resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Focus on Edge Cases and Fail States:** While averages are important, actively setting goals around "disaster deliveries" or "never delivered" orders is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>. These rare, terrible experiences lead to significant churn and high costs, even if they don't significantly impact average metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. For example, the DoorDash quality analytics team's goal is to eradicate "never delivered" orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.
*   **Beware of Missing Data:** Be aware of "what data don't we have?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. For instance, login errors might not appear in data because affected users cannot log in to generate data, indicating a problem that needs to be identified and fixed externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.

## Culture of Extreme Ownership

A key cultural element at DoorDash, instilled by founder Tony Xu, is "extreme ownership" over outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. This means going beyond defined job roles to solve problems, even if it means doing tasks not traditionally associated with a data scientist, like calling customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. This expectation fosters a mindset of "roll up your sleeves" and do what needs to be done to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>.

An example includes a data scientist team calling customers directly to understand why a new affordability initiative wasn't working as expected, rather than waiting for a qualitative research team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. This willingness to step outside traditional bounds, even doing some product management or engineering work, is encouraged and keeps the job interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.

## Global Data Organization

Managing a global data organization introduces complexities like different currencies, languages, and regulations (e.g., EU vs. non-EU countries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. However, Jessica notes that there are more similarities than differences in problems encountered across regions, making it feel like "going into a test with the answer key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>. This allows for leveraging past solutions while staying open to new ideas that might work in specific regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.

## AI in Data Teams

AI offers opportunities to enhance both the team's productivity and the product itself. Jessica is particularly excited about using AI to empower non-technical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

*   **Internal Chatbot for Data Support:** DoorDash uses an internal tool called "Ask Data AI" (named after their former Q&A Slack channel) which acts as a chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. This tool helps users edit queries, translate them to different business contexts (e.g., adjust a query for grocery business GOV), and reduces the analytics team's bandwidth drain from common requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.
*   **Office Hours:** The analytics team conducts "office hours" (started eight years ago) to provide support, teach SQL, review work, and serve as thought partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. AI tools complement this by allowing more users to self-serve their data needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.

## Jessica Lax's Career Journey and Advice

Despite not having a traditional data science background, Jessica became a data scientist out of necessity at DoorDash, self-teaching SQL and Python to solve problems around goal setting and market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. Her background in finance fostered a pragmatic approach, focusing on driving business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.

*   **Solve the Problem in Front of You:** Focus on solving the immediate problem at hand in the best way possible, rather than overthinking long-term global organizational structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. This organic, problem-first approach led to her unexpected career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.
*   **Competitive Drive:** A strong desire to win and willingness to take on tasks outside one's job description (e.g., handing out promo codes, doing customer support) are key traits found in early and current DoorDash employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
*   **Truth Seeking:** Jessica encourages people to actively seek and speak the truth, recognizing that in a world with much misinformation, it's an individual responsibility to discern fact from fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:45">[01:18:45]</a>.
*   **The "Committee of Sleep":** Problems difficult at night are often resolved in the morning after sleep. Jessica finds this especially useful for complex or emotional issues, allowing for clearer communication and a fresh perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

## [[Lessons in hiring and team building | Lessons in Hiring and Team Building]]

Jessica emphasizes the importance of a diverse team, not just in demographics but in professional backgrounds and prior company stages. This creates a rich learning environment where team members can teach each other different skills, from financial modeling to advanced statistics, and gain insights into scaling businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.

## Early DoorDash Stories and Culture

*   **Handing out Promo Codes:** In 2014, when DoorDash was new in Boston, Jessica and her small team (including a sales guy whose goal was signing merchants) would wake up at 5 AM to hand out promo codes attached to Kind bars in the cold winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. This demonstrated extreme ownership and dedication to growing the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
*   **Company-wide Customer Support during Outages:** During a major site outage, the entire company of about 20 people jumped online to do customer support, process refunds, and ensure deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. Jessica, being new, even went out to deliver pizza to the office herself to save Dashers' time, demonstrating a deeply ingrained customer-first culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.
*   **"WeDash" Program:** All employees participate in a "WeDash" program four times a year, where they go out dashing or do customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>. This builds empathy with consumers, Dashers, and merchants, and often helps identify product bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

These stories highlight DoorDash's unique culture of extreme ownership, customer-first approach, and a willingness to "roll up your sleeves" to get things done, which Jessica believes has been a critical part of their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

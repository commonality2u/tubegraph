Building a sales team in B2B SaaS is fundamentally about solving problems for customers, rather than merely selling commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. According to Jason Lemkin, founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community for SaaS and B2B Founders, this distinction is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Most B2B businesses will eventually need a sales team, even if they initially focus on [[Growth strategies for SaaS businesses | product-led growth]] (PLG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## When to Build a Sales Team
A common mistake founders make is avoiding sales because it feels "icky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, honesty about the need for a sales motion is key to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Key indicators that it's time to hire your first sales representative include:
*   You have personally closed the first 10-20 "unaffiliated" customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. These customers, found "from the ether," often indicate the path for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   More than 20% of your time as a founder is booked up with sales-related activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. At this point, you need leverage to avoid your calendar becoming unmanageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   You have established a repeatable sales process or script that consistently works, even if it's rudimentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

Founders often excel as "A+ middlers" in sales conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. While they might not be adept at initiating cold outreach or asking for the check, they are highly knowledgeable about the product and market, which customers appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. The most important skill for founders to learn is simply asking for "next steps" at the end of a meeting, even if it's not directly asking for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>.

## Initial Sales Hires (Account Executives - AEs)
When starting to hire, it's recommended to hire two sales representatives simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. This allows for A/B testing of human performance and provides insights into what's working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

The ideal first sales reps should be:
*   **Someone you would personally buy your product from** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This means they can explain the product and solve customer problems in a believable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **"Quirky Pirates and Romantics"**: They may not have a traditional corporate sales background but have a few "extra IQ points" and are genuinely passionate about your early, often feature-poor product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **Experienced in B2B sales**: Ideally with a couple of years of experience and enough maturity to be trusted with precious early leads and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.
*   **Product Gurus**: Early sales team members must be product experts. This contrasts with larger, more established companies where sales reps might only need to know "10 questions" before handing off to a sales engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

Interviewing Tip: Ask candidates to "sell me this app/product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. Give them time to prepare (e.g., by watching explainer videos or webinars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. If they haven't even watched basic product videos, they likely won't put in the work required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

Crucially, try to hire individuals whose *last product was harder to sell* than yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>. This can create a significant advantage as they will perceive your product as easier to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. Beware of candidates coming from easier-to-sell products (e.g., highly technical products if yours is less so, or vice-versa, or from market leaders when you're an underdog) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.

## When to Hire a VP of Sales
Do not hire a [[Building and scaling a growth team | VP of Sales]] too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. The ideal time to hire a [[Building and scaling a growth team | VP of Sales]] is when you have *two sales reps already hitting quota* and consistently closing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Hiring a VP before this stage is almost guaranteed to fail, as their role is to scale a repeatable process, not to find product-market fit or be the first individual contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

A good [[Building and scaling a growth team | VP of Sales]] should:
*   **"Carry a bag"**: This means they should be actively involved in closing sales themselves, not just managing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. They should be in deals 20-30 hours a week when they start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. If they don't want to do sales, it's a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.
*   **Love the "craft" of sales**: Beyond just loving money, they should enjoy honing scripts, beating competitors, and working on a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.
*   **Prioritize meeting customers**: A key interview question for any VP role (sales, product, marketing, customer success) is "What do you want to do your first 14 days?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. The correct answer should always involve meeting customers or prospects, not just focusing on internal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

Consider hiring a "stretch VP of Sales" â€“ someone who was a director or senior director previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. They are often more willing to "do the job" and less burnt out than those seeking their third VP role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>. A sales leader's ability to scale depends on their capacity to hire better managers under them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>.

## Compensation and Quota
When setting compensation for early sales hires:
*   **Pay market rates**: Expect to pay around 50% base salary and 50% bonus (On-Target Earnings - OTE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Initial ramp-up**: For the first 1-3 months (max one quarter), consider allowing reps to keep 100% of what they close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. This helps them gain confidence and see immediate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.
*   **Target revenue multiple**: Ultimately, a sales rep should bring in 3-5 times their OTE in closed revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. Aim for 3x for small businesses, 4x for mid-market, and 5x for enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.
*   **Don't be afraid if they make a lot of money**: If sales reps are making large commissions, it means they are bringing in significantly more revenue for the company, making them accretive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. This is a sign of a healthy [[Founderled sales strategies | sales strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

## Sales Organization Evolution
The sales organization typically scales using "rules of eight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>:
*   One manager for every eight Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. SDRs are generally entry-level positions responsible for lead generation (email, dialing) and screening inbound leads, acting as "openers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   One director for every eight Account Executives (AEs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>. AEs are more seasoned reps focused on closing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.
*   As the organization grows, directors or VPs will manage teams of 8, with eventual VPs managing groups of directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

Sales is often not a highly efficient function, meaning that headcount for sales can remain around half the company's size at various revenue milestones (e.g., $10M, $50M, $100M ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>. The career path for AEs is primarily into management, as dedicated "super IC" (individual contributor) roles in sales are rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## The Relationship Between Product and Sales
In well-run B2B organizations, the head of product (VP of Product or Chief Product Officer) should be deeply involved in sales, especially for large deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. Their deep product knowledge and ability to make commitments are crucial for closing complex deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.

Managing [[The role of product teams in the sales process | feature requests]] from sales:
*   Allocate a specific "budget" (e.g., 10% of story points) to the sales team each quarter for features they need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.
*   Sales leaders should be forced to prioritize these requests among themselves, as their priorities can change rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>.
*   Product leaders should engage in weekly meetings with sales leaders to discuss current development, upcoming plans, and any necessary changes, explaining the impact of disrupting ongoing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.
*   Stress between product and sales is a sign of a healthy, well-run company; the key is to have enough process to manage it without breaking the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

For product teams and their revenue goals:
*   While aligning on overall revenue goals is good, be cautious about "weaponizing" product teams by strictly tying individual PMs' KPIs and OKRs to revenue goals from experimental features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:11">[01:23:11]</a>. This can lead to short-term, customer-hostile tactics (e.g., "dark patterns" for upsells) that damage customer relationships and prevent revenue compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:11">[01:26:11]</a>.
*   Prioritize relentlessly bringing down churn, especially in PLG models, to ensure long-term compounding revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>.

## Additional Advice
*   **Trials**: The traditional 14-day trial for SaaS products originated from Salesforce sales reps wanting to close deals within the same month, not necessarily because it was best for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>. Infinite or very long trials (like Slack, Canva, early Zoom) can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>. Product teams should be the voice of the customer and advocate for trials that are customer-centric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>.
*   **Annual Contracts**: Forcing customers into annual contracts, especially for SMBs, can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>. Let customers pay how they want to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:06">[01:33:06]</a>.
*   **Win/Loss Analysis**: Companies should spend more time analyzing lost deals than won deals to truly learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>.
*   **Earn Price Increases**: If you raise prices, ensure you've added significantly more value to your product to earn that increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>.
*   **"VP of Free"**: In PLG models, there needs to be a "VP of Free" (often the founder or product leader) to champion the long tail of free users who might not convert immediately but are advocates for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:16">[01:32:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>. Products offering a free edition generally force more investment in engineering and onboarding, making the entire product better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>.

## Resources
*   **SaaStr University**: A free resource with courses on sales and other aspects of SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.
*   *From Impossible to Inevitable*: A book co-authored by Aaron Ross, with content from Jason Lemkin, offering insights into scaling sales organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:5:53">[01:5:53]</a>.
*   **Pavilion**: A community for sales professionals and founders, offering networking and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:43">[01:40:43]</a>.

## Events
SaaStr hosts some of the world's largest conferences for SaaS and B2B founders, including annual events in the Bay Area (over 15,000 people) and Europe (over 3,000 executives) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.

Unexpected aspects of running large conferences:
*   They are extremely expensive, costing millions of dollars to "turn the lights on" for large-scale multi-day events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:14">[01:54:14]</a>.
*   They exhibit "diseconomies of scale," where per-person costs increase significantly at larger scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>.
*   Despite high costs, top-tier events are valuable because they attract the best people (executives, vendors, prospects) who typically attend only one or two such events per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:25">[01:57:25]</a>.

Founders should consider hosting smaller events (e.g., steak dinners, meetups at free office spaces) for their customers and prospects. These gatherings foster community and can lead to more sales, as satisfied customers will sell to prospects on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:28">[01:52:28]</a>.

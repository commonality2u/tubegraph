The rise of AI answers transparently integrated into search results has led to a significant shift in how [[Impact of AI on SEO | SEO works]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Initially, some feared an "apocalypse" for traditional SEO, where the top long-form content previously secured the first click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, this landscape is now rapidly evolving with Google increasing the number of searches that include AI-generated answers at the top of results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>.

## Google's Response to Generative AI

### Origins of AI Integration in Search
Google and other tech companies were compelled to integrate AI into search following the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT at the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. ChatGPT's ability to provide written answers to any question led to conversations about the potential end of Google and SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. While not an immediate threat to [[seo_challenges_with_ai_answers | SEO]], Google was concerned about its primary stakeholder, Wall Street, perceiving the company as a "has-been" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Google's initial response included launching Bard (now Gemini) and then the "Search Generative Experience" (SGE), which essentially brought ChatGPT-like functionality into search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### AI Overviews (formerly Search Generative Experience - SGE)
SGE launched as a beta with significant issues, particularly concerning monetization (ads), liability for generative responses, and potential plagiarism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Google spent about a year testing this feature, an unusual pace for a "launch fast" company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

At Google I/O in May, SGE was renamed "AI Overviews" and launched to general fanfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Initial public reception was mixed, with embarrassing screenshots of AI Overviews generating unhelpful or harmful advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Despite a partial rollback, Google has since re-launched it more broadly, appearing on more search results for both logged-in and Incognito users, and in new regions like the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### Challenges for Google
Google faces challenges with [[Impact of AI on SEO | AI Overviews]], such as resolving monetization issues when providing direct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. The massive and exponentially growing amount of content, much of it AI-generated "slop," also strains Google's crawling infrastructure and risks polluting its index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

## [[Impact of AI on SEO | Impact of AI on SEO]]

The direct integration of AI answers impacts [[Impact of AI on SEO | SEO]] by pushing traditional search results further down the page, reducing the need for users to click links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This shift makes content less relevant if it's not positioned to capture mid-to-bottom funnel user intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

Historically, SEO focused on ranking for broad, top-of-funnel keywords (e.g., "cars") by creating long-form content and building links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. However, such keywords are now largely served by AI Overviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

### Shifting Relevance and Discovery
AI Overviews are excellent at providing summarized answers for "discovery" or "top-of-funnel" queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>. For example, asking for "beach vacation not in America but a 2-hour flight from X airport" will yield a direct AI answer, such as "Cancun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>.

This means that while the discovery step of search may be "swallowed up" by LLMs, the subsequent "mid-funnel" searches, where users have a clearer sense of what they want, remain a significant opportunity for traditional SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>.

### Top-of-Funnel vs. Mid-to-Bottom-of-Funnel Search
*   **Top-of-Funnel:** Queries seeking general information or initial exploration (e.g., "top podcast tools," "what is a CRM") are increasingly answered directly by AI Overviews, potentially disrupting sites that rely on broad informational content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. Companies like G2 and Capterra, which traditionally provide lists and comparisons, are likely to be massively disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:54">[02:09:54]</a>.
*   **Mid-to-Bottom-of-Funnel:** Once a user has a direction or specific intent, they move to mid-funnel searches. For example, after learning about podcast tools, they might search "Riverside price" or "Riverside features" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:02">[02:14:02]</a>. This is where SEO remains critical, focusing on conversion-oriented pages rather than just rankings for broad terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a>.

## [[seo_strategies_in_the_age_of_ai | SEO Strategies in the Age of AI]]

To be successful in this new AI paradigm, companies must rethink their approach to SEO.

### Rethinking SEO as Product-Led
SEO should be viewed as a product question, with product managers leading the charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Understanding the User:** Empathize with the user's self-discovery journey, asking what problem they are trying to solve and what they will search for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. If a company can't answer what someone will search for, they shouldn't do SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.
2.  **Creating the Asset:** Develop assets that directly address the user's need at the mid-to-bottom funnel. For example, Zapier created specific landing pages for "Gmail and Salesforce" integrations because users sought to connect those apps, even if they didn't know Zapier existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:11">[02:26:11]</a>. Tinder focused on local "online dating in [city]" pages to address the loneliness problem, providing a solution via their app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:51">[02:59:51]</a>.
3.  **Building the Product:** This involves design, engineering, and user research resources to build a product for the SEO user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:04">[03:10:04]</a>. The SEO asset should be a piece of the buyer's journey that leads to monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:04">[03:10:04]</a>.

For many B2B SaaS companies, traditional SEO may not offer a strong ROI because their sales cycles involve multiple stakeholders and are not a simple online conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:19">[03:54:19]</a>. Companies should compare the cost of SEO (resources, time, agencies) against other growth channels like paid marketing or influencer campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### [[Leveraging AI in product development | Leveraging AI for Content]]
AI is a tool, not a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.
*   **Don't** use AI to generate "worthless content" or "fluff" just for the sake of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. Google's documentation states that AI itself is not the problem, but the lack of helpfulness or usefulness of the content is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.
*   **Do** use AI to create useful content more cheaply and effectively, especially for product descriptions or to add features to existing pages that directly aid the user's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>. Examples include e-commerce product descriptions or summarizing product comparisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. AI can help tie together data to create useful content, like sports game summaries or earnings reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.

### AI Overviews as Branding
Appearing in an AI Overview is primarily a branding exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>. If Google's AI Overview mentions a company as a brand (e.g., "top CRM tools" include [Your Brand]), it signifies successful branding efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. If a link to a company's content appears, it means Google has summarized or "stolen" that content, and users may or may not click off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>.

### Google's Dominance
Despite the rise of new AI-powered search tools, Google is expected to maintain its dominance in search for a very long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. A recent verdict revealed Google holds 98% of mobile searches, and their default partnerships with companies like Apple, along with their strong brand and distribution, make it incredibly difficult for competitors like ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Claude to unseat them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. Even Bing offering itself to Apple for free was rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.

While TikTok and Instagram are gaining popularity for top-of-funnel discovery (especially among Gen Z, with 63% using TikTok for search) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>, Google remains the go-to for mid-funnel searches and transactional queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:19">[01:32:19]</a>.

### User Choice and Intent
The need for user choice in search means there will always be a demand for diverse results beyond a single AI-generated answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:20">[01:24:20]</a>. Users want to request their own information and have multiple options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>. Google's deep understanding of user data from past searches is crucial for providing relevant choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>.

### Monetization and Traffic
Businesses that rely on users taking an action (e.g., booking a hotel, buying shoes) will continue to benefit from search, even if search volumes for top-of-funnel queries decline due to AI Overviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>. However, media companies that monetize through ads on aggregated information (like WebMD) may see revenue decline as Google provides those answers directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.

Ultimately, the future of [[Impact of AI on SEO | SEO]] involves a shift in focus. Companies need to concentrate on the buyer's journey and provide valuable solutions at the mid-to-bottom of the funnel, using AI as a tool to enhance that process, rather than clinging to outdated metrics like top-of-funnel rankings or creating irrelevant content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:56">[01:33:56]</a>.

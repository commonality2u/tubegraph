Delegating effectively while upholding high standards is a challenge many professionals face, particularly as they advance in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>. A common concern is the fear that delegated tasks will not meet desired quality or efficiency, leading some to avoid delegation altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. To address this, Wes Ko developed the CEDAF framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

## The CEDAF Framework

CEDAF is an acronym that outlines a systematic approach to delegation, ensuring that tasks are not only handed off but also executed to high standards with clarity and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. It serves as a checklist for managers and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>, prompting reflection on critical aspects of the delegation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>.

### C: Comprehension

This first step focuses on ensuring the delegatee has all necessary information to understand the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. This includes:
*   Providing access to all relevant software tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>.
*   Clearly defining the desired end result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.

### E: Excitement

Engaging the delegatee by explaining the "why" behind the task is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>. Even for mundane tasks, articulating the importance to the project or company can increase understanding and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>. Connect the task to the delegatee's career goals or the organization's broader priorities to generate enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>.

### D: De-risk

Proactively identifying and mitigating potential risks associated with delegation is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. This can involve:
*   Breaking down large tasks into smaller components, such as starting with 10 rows of a spreadsheet instead of 100, to gauge effort and validate direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>.
*   Anticipating potential misunderstandings and clarifying expectations upfront, for instance, by stating, "You might think I mean this, but really I actually want this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>. This overlaps with the [[Most Obvious Objection (MOO)]] concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.

### A: Align

Create opportunities for the delegatee to ask questions and confirm understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. Managers often assume clarity after explaining a task, but allowing a chance for questions helps uncover misunderstandings and ensures both parties are on the same page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. This process often reveals forgotten details or areas needing better explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.

### F: Feedback

Establishing the shortest possible feedback loop is critical for effective delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>. Instead of waiting a week for updates, consider checking in daily or even brainstorming initial steps within the same conversation where the task is delegated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. This allows for quick course correction and continuous support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>.

## Upfront Investment

A core principle underlying the CEDAF framework is the concept of making a "little bit more upfront investment" in communication and preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>. While it may take a few extra minutes in the moment, this investment prevents numerous future questions, back-and-forth exchanges, and potential rework, ultimately saving significant time down the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:04">[01:39:04]</a>. This strategy contributes to [[Building a culture of excellence]] and higher quality work output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Application to AI and Agents

The CEDAF framework is highly relevant for interacting with AI tools and agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. When delegating to AI, it's essential to:
*   Ensure the AI "comprehends" the task by providing clear and complete instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:33">[01:14:33]</a>.
*   Communicate the "excitement" or importance of the task (e.g., "This is very important to my job") as AIs have shown to take such prompts more seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a>.
*   "De-risk" by anticipating potential AI errors or misunderstandings and providing specific constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.
*   "Align" by using iterative prompting where the AI confirms understanding or presents interim results for feedback before proceeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>.
*   Set up quick "feedback" loops, allowing the AI to check in or ask clarifying questions during the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>.

The principles of effective delegation are foundational, regardless of whether the delegatee is a human team member or an artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>.

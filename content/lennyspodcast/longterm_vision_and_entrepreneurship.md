Toby Lütke, the CEO of Shopify, emphasizes the importance of a long-term vision, particularly a "100-year vision," when building a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This approach encourages thinking backward from a desired future state to inform present decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The 100-Year Vision

For Lütke, a 100-year vision means focusing on the core mission rather than short-term software projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. It's about what will endure for decades, like "80 years" on a specific time frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This long-term perspective means that decisions are made based on what will be most valuable for "long-term pursuits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. He believes that long-term focus is powerful for decision-making, though rarely practiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.

Lütke applies this by constantly asking, "What would we want to have done 20 years ago on this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>, and "What's the decision our future selves would want us to make?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>. He sees "future casting" as "extremely valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>.

## Entrepreneurship as a Core Mission

A key aspect of Shopify's 100-year vision is its mission to make [[creating_an_entrepreneurial_culture_within_an_organization | entrepreneurship]] "more common" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. Lütke views entrepreneurship as "precious" and essential for society, noting that "all economics like our son of living entirely depends on you know businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.

He highlights that company building can have "lasting impact" by shaping a "path" that adheres to desired values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. This commitment to a long-term mission leads to an environment where product decisions are less about short-term gains and more about fostering long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>. He notes that companies often "fail" a "corporate marshmallow test" by "pulling future profits forward at a discount" or "defecting on partnerships" for short-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

## Long-Term Partnerships

Lütke cites the partnership between Shopify and Stripe as an example of long-term thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>. Both companies, when small, decided to "work on assumption that both of us are going to win our markets and work together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. This "iterated prisoners dilemma" approach, where both sides collaborate, creates "way more value" over long periods of time than any short-term defection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>.

He summarizes this philosophy: "On a long enough timeline, playing positive sum games with your customers is the ultimate growth hack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. Shopify's business model, which takes a "very very small stake of the sales" from merchants, incentivizes making customers "as successful as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>.

## Positional Game vs. Tactics

Lütke uses a chess analogy to explain his strategic approach, distinguishing between the "positional game" and "tactics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>. While the business world often focuses on "tactics" (e.g., A/B testing for immediate conversion rate increases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>, he believes the "positional game" is more crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.

The positional game involves establishing "territory on the map," building "trust with Merchants," and becoming a deeply relied-upon partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>. If the positional game is played well, "the tactics are ceded" and many people can be hired to execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. However, focusing too much on tactics can lead to "extracting through the tactics the entirety of the value that you have created" and eventually causing the company to "fade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>.

For [[lessons_from_successful_founders_and_startups | founders]], Lütke advises to first "don't die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>, and then "focus on the positional game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>. Founders create "finite winnable games for people" that serve the "infinite game of developing" the mission and increasing the company's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. He views building a company as an "exploration and a collaborative inquiry into a question that is implied by the mission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>.

This perspective is influenced by the book *Finite and Infinite Games* by James Carse, which Lütke highly recommends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.

## Maximizing Entrepreneurial Potential

Shopify's strategy to make entrepreneurship more common involves simplifying complexity for merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. Lütke believes it's a "moral obligation" for software to not make people feel "dumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>. By making complex tasks like taxes or payments automatic, Shopify helps more businesses come into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>.

He understands that starting a business is an "act of pure courage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>, and many entrepreneurs face discouragement and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>. When software presents an overwhelming challenge, it can lead aspiring entrepreneurs to give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>. Therefore, by reducing complexity, Shopify "causes more entrepreneurship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>, which is his "best answer to the most important question of my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>. This focus on simplifying the experience is a "great source of energy" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:22">[01:25:22]</a>.

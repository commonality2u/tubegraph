Your podcast is for builders, and a key question for builders is their energy source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For Toby, his energy source is dissatisfaction with the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He believes that today is the dystopia of the future, and it behooves everyone to build things that lead towards progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The 100-Year Vision
Toby operates with a 100-year vision for Shopify, a unique approach in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This means constantly "looking into the future and then thinking backwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. At a 100-year horizon, one cannot focus on specific software projects but rather on the fundamental mission itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The core purpose of Shopify is to make [[Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management | entrepreneurship]] more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>.

### Core Principles of [[Longterm vision and entrepreneurship | Longterm Vision]]
*   **Dissatisfaction with Status Quo**: Toby's primary driver is a deep dissatisfaction with the current state of things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. He views today as the "dystopia of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>, which motivates the pursuit of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.
*   **First Principles Thinking**: Product ideas should be derived from first principles, considering all available building blocks rather than replicating existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. This involves understanding the power and composability of current technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. Skipping this exercise and merely copying others is an abdication of product leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. If most people are doing something a certain way, Toby defaults to not doing it that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
*   **Challenging Aesthetics**: Business aesthetics often lead astray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. Pessimism may sound sophisticated, and being metrics-driven is often seen as sophisticated, while optimism and a focus on "fun" can sound naive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. However, the most powerful, unquantifiable things in business are fun and delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Overfitting**: Metrics, when they become goals, cease to be good metrics, a concept similar to Goodhart's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Shopify avoids overfitting to quantifiable metrics, recognizing that most valuable product aspects are unquantifiable (e.g., taste, quality, passion, love) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

### Building for the Future
*   **Path Dependence**: Every existing solution and product is highly path-dependent, often based on compromises from past truths that are no longer valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. This necessitates re-deriving decisions from current foundational assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.
*   **The "Toby Tornado"**: This refers to Toby's approach of rapid change management, conflict, or "real talk" compressed into a short timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. If a project isn't good, he might stop it and pivot, ensuring people don't waste time on non-viable efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Maximizing Potential**: Toby believes no one is close to their maximum potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. He constantly reminds people of their own potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Holding people to high standards helps them achieve things they didn't imagine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Partnerships**: Shopify's long-term partnership with Stripe is an example of playing "iterated prisoner's dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. A long time horizon (like 100 years) makes it clear that coordinating and collaborating is the correct strategy, yielding far more value over time than short-term defections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>. Toby emphasizes that on a long enough timeline, playing positive-sum games with customers is the ultimate growth hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.

### Nurturing [[Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management | Entrepreneurship]]
Shopify's mission is fundamentally about making [[Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management | entrepreneurship]] more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. Toby believes that simplifying complex processes (like taxes or payments) in software directly leads to more businesses existing on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. Software should empower people, not make them feel dumb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Lowering the "net amount of courage needed" to start a business, through intuitive design and automation, creates immense value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a>.

### The [[Entrepreneurial mindset and leadership insights | Entrepreneurial Mindset]] for Individuals
Individuals should view their careers through an [[Entrepreneurial mindset and leadership insights | entrepreneurial mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:36">[01:34:36]</a>, thinking of themselves as a "product" or "Talent as a Service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:45">[01:34:45]</a>. Career success isn't just about mentors or promotions, but about developing a unique "talent stack" where you are "too good to ignore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>. Toby found his unique path by following his curiosity in programming, computers, and retail, which led to building Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:59">[01:29:59]</a>.

> "If you are committed to following your curiosity as to the next step and optimize for maximum amount of learning when you choose these steps it takes you from one place to another and you actually realize the world's full of lies about human potential." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>

> "There is no speed limit for personal growth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>

### The Importance of Caring
Ultimately, the quality of any product is a direct reflection of "how much the people who created it gave a \[damn] about the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:17">[01:37:17]</a>. Product leaders have a crucial role in ensuring their team cares deeply, which can be achieved through empathy for users and an "exothermically infectious" passion from the leader themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.

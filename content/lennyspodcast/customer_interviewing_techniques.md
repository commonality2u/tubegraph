Customer interviewing is a critical skill for product development, often underestimated, that helps teams make better product decisions by understanding customer needs and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## The Importance of Discovery

Every item in a product backlog is a "bet," and discovery helps make that bet better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While some situations allow for risky bets, doing zero discovery means all bets are risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The best approach is to continue making bets in parallel while starting to do some discovery to improve those bets over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This means continuously delivering and continuously discovering, fostering a "discovery habit" to improve bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Continuous Discovery

Continuous Discovery is defined as building in continuous feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. This approach recognizes that digital products are never truly "done" and customer needs are constantly evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

It contrasts with old, project-based research methods which often lack the time to pause development for extensive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. Continuous discovery can be achieved with as little as one interview per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. When faced with the sentiment of "no time for discovery," it often means "no time for project-based research," which is understandable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

### Making the Case for [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development | Talking to Customers]]

Even if an organization prescribes a fixed roadmap, individual product team members can still find and [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development | talk to customers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. It's often possible to leverage personal networks for [[talking_to_customers_for_product_development | customer conversations]], especially for consumer products or B2B environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. By understanding business outcomes and how one's work contributes to them, better daily decisions can be made even when solutions are prescribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Automating Customer Recruiting for Interviews

To make weekly interviews easier, it's beneficial to make them a recurring meeting that appears on the calendar without manual effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.

The most common strategy is to allow customers to opt-in while using the product or service, similar to an NPS survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. If a user indicates willingness to talk, scheduling software can be used to book a time directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. This works well for consumers and B2B end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.

For buyers and decision-makers in B2B, internal teams like sales, account managers, or support can recruit by asking customers during their regular phone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. Teams can define a specific "trigger" (e.g., "looking to talk to someone experiencing this pain point") for recruiters each week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. The goal is for the product team to only need to show up and conduct the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

Tools like Calendly, Google Calendar, Outlook, Salesforce for scheduling, and Qualaroo, Ethnio, Intercom, Usabilla, Chameleon, Hotjar for intercepting users can facilitate this automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

## [[Interview techniques for discovering customer insights | Effective Interviewing Techniques]]

### Focus on Stories, Not Direct Questions

A common mistake is writing lengthy interview protocols with direct "who, what, why, how" questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. This leads to an unnatural conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>. Instead, the interview should feel like a casual, natural conversation, akin to "having a beer with a buddy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

Instead of asking direct questions out of context, which can yield unreliable answers, ask the customer to "tell me about the last time you [did something related to the product]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This method helps collect rich stories grounded in specific instances, revealing contexts and nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

*   **Be Curious:** Continuously ask "what happened next?" or "tell me about that" to help the interviewee elaborate on their experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.
*   **Listen Actively:** Avoid focusing on asking the *next* question; instead, listen closely to the interviewee's responses to uncover friction points or opportunities for deeper exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Summarize and Bring Back:** Summarize what you've heard to show you're listening and bring the conversation back to specific moments for more detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

### Focus on Past Behavior, Not Hypotheticals

Product people are in the business of understanding and changing behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. A common mistake is focusing on what people *would* do, what they *think*, or *why* they think they do something, which is often unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. The most reliable measure is to ask about actual past behavior: "What did you actually do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.

## Addressing Skepticism

### Small Sample Sizes in User Research

When challenged about making decisions based on few interviews, a common response is that one interview provides more data than zero, which is often the case for many business decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. Skepticism often stems from a differing opinion on the conclusion, not a genuine concern about the sample size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

Product teams operate with small data in user research because they are in the business of changing behavior, not just seeking new knowledge, and they have continuous feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. This allows for decisions based on small experiments, as more reliable data can be gathered through larger-scale production prototyping over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.

### Experiment vs. User Research

The terms "experiment" and "user research" can be ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. In a discovery context, key activities are:
*   **Qualitative Interviewing:** Used to learn about the "opportunity space" by identifying unmet needs, pain points, and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>. While observation can be even better, interviewing is more sustainable weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.
*   **Assumption Testing:** Any activity that helps evaluate a solution by starting with a specific assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. Avoid running large-scale experiments that test an entire idea before validating underlying assumptions, as these are too long and costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>.

To make assumption testing continuous and sustainable:
1.  Break down ideas into underlying assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.
2.  Prioritize those assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
3.  Run small tests that focus solely on validating specific assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.

Good teams can run half a dozen to a dozen assumption tests in one week, spanning multiple ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>. This allows for comparison and contrast of solutions, fostering a continuous discovery cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.

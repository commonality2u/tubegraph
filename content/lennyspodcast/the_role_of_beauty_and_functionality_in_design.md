From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

The term "beauty" has seen a dramatic decrease in usage in digitized books from the 1800s to the 2000s, aligning with a focus on functionality as supreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, functionality and beauty are not opposite concepts; in fact, beauty actively enhances functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Beautiful products are easier to use, more approachable, and more compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Furthermore, beauty can increase trust, signaling that painstaking detail and care have been invested in a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe, emphasizes the crucial role of beauty and quality in product design. She previously held leadership roles at Lyft and Airbnb, companies recognized for their well-designed products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Prioritizing Design and Quality

While many product managers and founders intellectually grasp the [[importance_of_design_in_product_development | value of design and high quality]], it's often not prioritized over new features due to unclear ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Levels of Quality
Quality exists on a spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>:
*   **Baseline**: The product functions and provides its core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   **Good**: It performs exceedingly well and is error-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Great**: It exceeds expectations and offers value the user wasn't even seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

Product quality should be aligned with user expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Companies are often "seduced by the chase of another feature" rather than perfecting existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Prioritizing features with measurable business goals over less quantifiable quality improvements is a common challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Quality is Growth
The best companies understand that quality is non-negotiable and a long-term necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Quality is not separate from growth; it *is* growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Making a product easier to use and more understandable drives adoption and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

At Stripe, the growth team focuses maniacally on building better experiences because it directly ties to business metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. For example, improving onboarding flows has increased activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
A significant example of business impact through quality is Stripe's checkout experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>:
*   Research showed 99% of top e-commerce sites had errors in their checkout flow, hindering seamless and quick transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   By improving the quality of the checkout experience, Stripe observed a **10.5% increase in businesses' revenue** when switching from an older to a newer checkout form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. These small details have a material impact on revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

## The Designer's Lens on Quality
It's a pet peeve to distinguish between "business goals" and "design goals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Impactful products are quality products that serve customers positively, building stronger businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Designers often focus on the emotional experience and user feelings, bringing an important lens to the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Cross-disciplinary teams are crucial as checks and balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

Great products combine utility, usability, and desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. Beauty makes things more useful and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. Craft or beauty alone without utility doesn't lead to a high-quality product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. However, meticulous craft and attention to detail are paramount for a product to gain esteem, respect, and reusability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

## Defining Great Design and Beauty
In their book "Beauty," Stefan Sagmeister and Jessica Walsh argue that beauty enhances functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. There is some objectivity to what enhances things beautifully; people often agree on what they prefer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

A key aspect often overlooked in business is the importance of how people feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. The environment and design of a space can impact feelings, as shown by studies of tweets from Penn Station (negative) versus Grand Central (positive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

At Stripe, a B2B financial infrastructure company, beauty is a key priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>:
*   **Increases Trust**: Painstaking detail signals care for all aspects, even unseen ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Easier to Use**: Leads to better user outcomes, helping businesses make right decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
*   **Beauty Begets Beauty**: When users see care and creativity, it reinforces trust and pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   **Matter of Pride**: High quality and beauty attract talented individuals who want their craft recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

## Operationalizing Quality and Beauty

### Stripe's Website Design
Stripe's website is viewed as an articulation of their care for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. They "meld Art and Science" combining creativity with technical power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. For their website, design and engineering functions report to the design organization, and they work side-by-side, rapidly iterating on ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

### Key Themes for Building Quality
Based on conversations with other design and product leaders, key themes for building quality include:
1.  **Quality is a Group Effort**: It cannot be delegated to a single person or QA team; it requires organizational commitment and shared standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
2.  **Vision and Alignment**: Even with talented people, a shared vision is needed to ensure individual great work fits together as a cohesive whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. Analogous to building a house with an architect and general contractor to ensure all parts fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
3.  **Editing and Courage**: Leaders need the courage to say "no, this isn't good enough" even after significant effort, to maintain high standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
4.  **User Perspective / Journeys**: Understanding the product from the user's end-to-end journey is critical to assessing and improving quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. Users rarely interact with a product in isolation; their experience spans learning, getting to know it, and using it over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.

### The "Walk the Store" Process (Operationalizing Quality)
To prevent quality regression over time (where shipped products get worse as new features are added without holistic consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>), Stripe implemented a "Walk the Store" program.
*   **Purpose**: Increase awareness and accountability of leaders for product quality across user journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.
*   **Key Journeys**: They focus on 15 critical user journeys that deeply matter to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.
*   **Leadership Ownership**: Each journey has dedicated engineering, product, and design leaders responsible for its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    *   Leaders regularly "walk the store" by reviewing the journeys as if they are users, starting from an internet search through various touchpoints (website, docs, dashboard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
    *   They "friction log" their experiences, noting what works and what doesn't, filing bugs, and reaching out to relevant teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. This provides a visceral understanding of pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>.
    *   The experience is scored based on a rubric covering usability, utility, desirability, and "surprisingly great" moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. They use a color-based scoring system (e.g., yellow, yellow-green) to avoid getting caught up in subjective numerical precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>.
*   **Calibration**: Quarterly, leaders meet in "PQR" (Product Quality Review) sessions to calibrate scores, discuss issues, and ensure a shared understanding of the quality bar across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: Leads to increased awareness, accountability, and upstream impact (e.g., realizing SEO articulation needs to align with later parts of the journey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. It converts skeptical functional leaders into believers in the importance of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

## Prioritizing Design Improvements
While some companies allocate specific percentages of time for bug fixes vs. new features, Stripe relies on hiring people with great judgment and pride in their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. Leadership advocacy for quality fuels this prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>. Showing how quality improvements directly impact business metrics (e.g., reducing support calls by making a button clearer) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

In performance evaluations, it's important to define "impact" broadly, beyond just immediate business metrics, to include long-term projects and quality efforts that may be harder to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. Stripe's level ladder system and operating principles, which include "meticulous craft," reinforce the expectation of high quality across all roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

## Team Building and Leadership Lessons
A clarifying formula for leading and growing teams is:
**Performance = Potential - Interference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>
*   **Potential**: Increase potential by hiring well and developing talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>.
*   **Interference**: Decrease interferences that hold talented people back from doing great work and cause burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

### Reducing Interference through Team Structure
At Lyft, Katie observed a similar situation to early Airbnb where the design team sat separately from engineering and product, leading to wasted work and misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. This physical and organizational separation created "interference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>. By evolving the team structure to bring designers, engineers, and product managers physically and organizationally closer together, aligning on shared goals, they achieved faster iteration cycles and better clarity, while still maintaining dedicated creative spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. This demonstrates the impact of [[operationalizing_quality_in_product_design | operationalizing quality in product design]] through team structure and [[proximity_to_customers_in_product_design | proximity to customers in product design]].

### Fostering Awareness
As companies grow, people can lose touch with what's happening across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>. Katie implemented a practice of having designers share screenshots or prototypes of their work in a shared Google Slide deck every few weeks (now monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.
*   This visual approach (a "Picture Tells a Thousand Words, a Prototype Saves a Thousand Meetings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>) allows designers to see what others are working on, identify similar patterns, and discover potential overlaps or redundancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.
*   It's shared with product managers, engineering leaders, and company leaders, providing a holistic view of the "journey" of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>.
*   This process, though initially feeling like "opening the curtain" on unfinished work, ultimately makes the work better and saves time by catching misalignments sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.

### Bold Ideas and Vision Work
Companies often fear bold ideas, preferring incremental approaches because they are easier to measure and feel safer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. This "dangerous tendency" can prevent making the whole product better, as user experience spans across products and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>.

It's important to "reach for the stars and land on the Moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. Vision work, which sketches out the ideal, comprehensive experience, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. Like an "11-star experience" (a concept from Brian Chesky) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>, knowing the ideal outcome allows for a strategic, measured approach to development, even if the whole thing isn't shipped at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>. This ties into [[category_design_in_product_development | category design in product development]].

### Hiring Designers
When hiring designers, prioritize:
*   **Taste and Character**: These are harder to teach than tools and process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. Look for great judgment and a honed sense of taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. This is part of [[building_taste_and_design_acuity_in_digital_products | building taste and design acuity in digital products]].
*   **Humility**: Essential for teamwork, respect, empathy, and understanding users. Humble designers are more likely to listen to users and strive for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.
*   **Hustle/Hutzpah (Courage)**: The act of creation can be scary. Designers need the courage to propose new ideas, to say "this is not good enough," and to fight for greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. This contributes to [[creativity_and_innovation_in_product_design | creativity and innovation in product design]].
*   **Doer vs. Thinker**: For early-stage companies, a "doer" is likely needed, but a "senior leader design advisor" can provide the strategic lens for building a user-focused organization from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>.

## Favorite Project at Stripe
Stripe Press publishes books on "ideas of progress" that don't always relate to financial infrastructure but align with Stripe's mission to increase the GDP of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>. They prioritize delivering these ideas in beautiful books, demonstrating their pursuit of creativity and excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>. A notable project is their reprinting of "Poor Charlie's Almanac," accompanied by a unique teaser site that showcases the "Art and Science" of their website team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>.

## Design as Intention
At its core, design is simply **intention** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>. It's about bringing intentionality to decisions, considering who is impacted and who is using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>. While design expertise brings creative skills and great taste, anyone in any function can bring more care and intentionality, leading to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>.

## Personal Lessons
Katie shared a personal lesson from learning to fly a plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:58">[01:30:58]</a>. When her instructor moved his seat back during a landing, it was a visceral experience of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:46">[01:31:46]</a>. She applies this to product leadership by considering how she can show her team trust and faith in their ability to take on challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>. This exemplifies how insights from other domains can transform approaches to [[the_role_of_ai_in_transforming_engineering_and_product_design | engineering and product design]].

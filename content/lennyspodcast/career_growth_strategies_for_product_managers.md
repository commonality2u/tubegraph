VR Deman, Head of Product at Gojek, is recognized as a leading product professional in Asia for his ability to build strong product and design talent and help people [[pathways_to_break_into_product_management | transition into product management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. He has developed a [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | career growth framework]] for product managers based on observations over a decade and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This framework, known as the "Three W's," outlines key areas where successful product managers differentiate themselves and accelerate their [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## The Three W's [[Career Growth Framework for Product Managers]]

The framework consists of three pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>:
1.  What you produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
2.  What you bring to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
3.  What's your operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>

Successful product managers often excel in at least two, if not all three, of these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### 1. What You Produce: Focus on Outputs First

Early in your [[career development and growth strategies | career]], the primary focus should be on *outputs* rather than immediate *impact* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Outputs** are tangible deliverables, such as launching a product, analyzing experiments, or contributing to a go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   The advice for early-career [[key_skills_for_product_managers | product managers]] is to focus on "just getting stuff out and done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This means shipping products, being helpful, and producing something that makes the team and manager's lives simpler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   As you become more senior, you transition to focusing on *outcomes* (product area goals) and *leadership* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. However, it's crucial to continue honing your craft on outputs, even at senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Don't forget your Individual Contributor (IC) roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   Being "useful" means doing small things that make an impact and contribute to your learning, rather than only focusing on "mini-CEO" tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

### 2. What You Bring to the Table: Impact on Impact

This pillar focuses on your individual contribution to the product's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. It's not enough for the product to be successful; you must demonstrate that you were a useful contributor to that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   **Quality of Artifacts**: Ensure the quality of product artifacts such as Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), product notes, product strategy documents, and design briefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. These artifacts demonstrate your [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]] in data and metrics, design and research, technology, and [[becoming_more_strategic_in_product_management | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   **Beyond Arguments**: Instead of bringing arguments or pushbacks, channelize questions, inputs, and direction into strategic choices that shape discussions and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
*   **"I got this" Aura**: Cultivate an aura where teammates feel confident that when something is put on your plate, it will be done well and not forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

### 3. What's Your Operating Model: How You Work with Others

This is considered the most important factor for progressing from mid-senior to senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. It encompasses communication, collaboration, organizational, and community [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Three Tenets for Interaction with Stakeholders**:
    1.  Raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
    2.  Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
    3.  Be in charge of getting decisions made, not making all decisions yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   **Art of Pushback**: When pushing back on ideas, bring the conversation to a logical space rather than an emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. Aim to add value and advance the product's direction and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
*   **Role Clarity**: As a [[role_of_product_managers_in_organizations | product manager]], you are the "community enabler" that ties everyone together towards a common mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. You are the only discipline that co-collaborates and pairs with all other disciplines (strategy, technology, design, data), giving you a unique insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

## Pitfalls that Impede [[Career Growth]]

Three mindset shifts can hinder [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | career growth]] for product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>:

### 1. Focusing on Things You Cannot Control
*   Early in your career, you focus on what you *can* control (your output, your craft) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
*   As you become mid-senior, the focus often shifts to external factors: "Why is the organization not doing this for me?" or "Why can't that stakeholder change?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.
*   To continue [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | growing]], maintain focus on what you *can* control, such as improving your [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]] in data, technology, communication, and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

### 2. Your Relationship with Change
*   Early on, the rate of personal [[career_development_and_growth_strategies | skill development]] and learning is high, leading to rapid [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | career growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.
*   At mid-senior levels, people might become hesitant to take on new challenges, fearing the impact on their [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
*   Continuously seek ways to increase your rate of change and [[career development and growth strategies | self-improvement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. Benchmark yourself against the best in the industry, not just within your organization, to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

### 3. How You See Yourself (Self-Story)
*   The stories you tell yourself about who you are can either enable or hinder your [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. For example, labeling yourself as a "high agency PM" might excuse brashness or cutting corners, while "hyper-collaborative" might excuse indecisiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.
*   Identify and correct these self-stories by seeking feedback from trusted individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.
*   Embrace a "learner" mindset. Continuously interact with people smarter than you, read books, and consume content to stay grounded and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.

## [[Key Strategies and Practices for Effective Product Management and Team Building | Strategies for Leveling Up]]

*   **Be Open to Feedback**: Actively listen to and appreciate feedback, even when it's difficult, as it is a gift that helps you improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
*   **Pick a Focus Area**: You cannot improve on every [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skill]] simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. Identify the area that offers the maximum leverage for your [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.
    *   **Recommendation**: When starting, pick one [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skill]] from data or technology, and one from design and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.
    *   If you come from a design/research background, focus on data or tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. If from data/tech, focus on design/research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.
    *   Once proficient in two of these, then focus on [[becoming_more_strategic_in_product_management | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.
    *   "Softer" skills like communication, collaboration, and community engagement are lifelong pursuits, where you will always have room to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.
*   **Understand the [[Role of Product Managers in Organizations | Product Manager's Role]]**: The product manager's role is often ambiguous. Instead of obsessing over a precise definition, focus on your contribution and output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. If something is blocking product progress, a product manager should work on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. Embrace the "art" and "science" of product management through practice and frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.

## Contrarian Views on [[Career Growth]]

*   **Intent is Not Enough**: While good intent is important, your actions, behavior, communication, and collaboration must also align and visibly demonstrate your capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.
*   **Effort and Hours Matter**: It's crucial to put in the effort and hours to [[career_development_and_growth_strategies | grow]] and improve your [[key_skills_for_product_managers | skills]]. This is often seen as "Politically Incorrect" but is essential for personal and [[career_growth_and_impact_for_product_managers | career development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.
*   **It's Never Too Late**: You can pursue what you want to do and be at any stage of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

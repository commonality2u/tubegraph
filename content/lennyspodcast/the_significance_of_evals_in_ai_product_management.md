Evals, short for evaluations, are critical tools in the realm of [[impact_of_ai_on_product_management | AI product management]], serving as a fundamental way to assess and guide the development of AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. They function much like a quiz or a test for a model, gauging its proficiency in specific subject areas or its ability to respond to particular questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

## What are Evals?
Evals are essentially "unit tests" for AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. They evaluate how well a model performs in tasks such as creative writing, graduate-level science, or competitive coding, acting as benchmarks for a model's intelligence and capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

## Why Evals are Crucial for AI Product Development
The importance of evals stems from the unique nature of AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which differ significantly from traditional software components:

*   **Fuzzy Inputs and Outputs**: Unlike databases that provide defined outputs for defined inputs, LLMs handle fuzzy, subtle human language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. Their responses are not always identical, even for the same query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **Understanding Model Reliability**: For product managers, knowing the model's accuracy is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. A product built around a model that is 60% accurate will differ vastly from one that is 95% or 99.5% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Evals provide this critical insight into performance percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement and Fine-tuning**: Models are not static; they can be continuously taught and improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Evals allow teams to "hill climb" on performance, testing whether models are getting better at specific use cases as they are fine-tuned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. This is particularly relevant for tailoring models to specific industries or company-specific data that isn't publicly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   **Guiding Product Design**: The capabilities of AI models are constantly evolving, with new breakthroughs emerging every few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Evals help product teams understand the current limitations and possibilities, informing how products should be designed around these dynamic capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

## Evals as a Core Skill for Product Managers
The ability to write effective evals is becoming a core skill for product managers and other product builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This skill enables teams to:

*   **Define Hero Use Cases**: By identifying key scenarios and desired "amazing" answers, teams can design evals that accurately measure a model's effectiveness for specific product features, such as deep research capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   **Facilitate Iterative Development**: Evals are integral to the iterative feedback loop between product design and research. They help in understanding problems, gathering data, and fine-tuning models to perform better for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
*   **Bridge Research and Product**: Strong evals help ensure that research breakthroughs are effectively translated into usable product capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.

## The Future of Evals and Fine-tuning
As AI becomes more ubiquitous, resembling the pervasiveness of transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>, there will be an increased reliance on fine-tuned models for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>. This means:

*   **Integration of Researchers**: Product teams will likely incorporate machine learning engineers or "quasi-researcher" types whose core workflow includes fine-tuning models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>.
*   **Ensemble of Models**: Complex problems will increasingly be solved by ensembles of models, with different specialized, fine-tuned models handling specific tasks within a broader problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. These ensembles, much like human teams, combine different skills (fine-tuned models) to achieve a better overall outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.
*   **Custom Evals for Tailored Performance**: Custom evals will be essential to measure the performance of these company-specific or use-case-specific fine-tuned models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.

Ultimately, the ability to effectively evaluate and fine-tune AI models through evals is crucial for building robust, reliable, and highly specialized AI products in a rapidly advancing technological landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

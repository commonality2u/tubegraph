[[product_positioning_and_its_importance | Product positioning]] defines how a product is the best at delivering specific value to a well-defined set of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. It encompasses alternatives, differentiation, value delivery, target audience, and market category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## The Problem of Misalignment
A significant cause of weak [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]] is a lack of perfect alignment across an organization's teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This often manifests in different parts of the company having slightly varied understandings of the product's [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]]:
*   A founder may have a clear idea, but the marketing department's interpretation might be slightly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   The sales pitch can vary further from marketing and the founder's vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   The product team might conceive of the [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | product]] slightly differently still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

Most often, [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]] problems stem from misalignment, where one part of the company might have the [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]] correct, but other parts are not on the same page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

### Scenarios of Misalignment
1.  **Founder's Vision vs. New Leadership**: A founder may know exactly how to articulate the product's story and [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | position]] it effectively to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. However, as the company grows and new VPs of marketing, sales, and product are hired, they might not grasp the [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]] in the same way, leading to inconsistencies in external communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. The founder struggles to bring everyone into alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
2.  **Market Shift and Disconnected Leadership**: In another scenario, a founder who once deeply understood the market may find that the market has shifted rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Newer senior hires (e.g., head of [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | product]] or marketing) might realize the company is [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioned]] for a past market, but struggle to align the founder and other teams who have different, fragmented information from their respective areas (sales, marketing, product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

## Achieving Alignment for Effective Positioning
To effectively fix and implement [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]], it must be a collaborative team effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. It cannot be solely developed by the marketing department or product managers and then "heaved over the wall" to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

Key stakeholders to involve in a [[steps_in_positioning_a_product | positioning exercise]] include:
*   Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>
*   Product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>
*   Sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>
*   Customer Success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>
*   Executive Team, particularly the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>

By bringing these groups together, they can share their expertise and understanding of customers and the [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | product]], leading to agreement and alignment on the [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. This ensures everyone "sings the same song" when executing the [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

## Output of the Alignment Process
The outcome of a successful [[steps_in_positioning_a_product | positioning]] process, involving key stakeholders, typically includes:
1.  **Documented Positioning**: A document outlining the core [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]] elements: what the product competes with, its differentiators, the value it delivers, target customers, and the market category it aims to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. This serves as a foundation for marketing to build its messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.
2.  **Sales Narrative (Pitch)**: Crucially, the documented [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]] must be translated into a compelling sales narrative or pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>. If sales teams cannot effectively tell the product's story, they cannot sell it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. This narrative should also be understood and told by product, customer success, and the CEO, ensuring consistency across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>. The development of this pitch often involves storyboarding and then creating actual decks, demos, and scripts for testing with qualified prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.

Without this crucial step of translating [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]] into a shared narrative, teams may conceptually understand the [[product_positioning_and_its_importance | positioning]] but fail to effectively communicate it externally, leading to continued misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

Graham Weaver, a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business and founder/CEO of Alpine Investors, emphasizes that significant achievements often require enduring difficulties and maintaining persistence over long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. He counters the common perception, often fueled by social media, that success happens overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Based on his experience investing in 600 businesses, success stories are consistently very long journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

## Embracing Difficulty: "Worse First" and "Life is Suffering"

Weaver introduces two powerful, albeit seemingly pessimistic, quotes that highlight the necessity of facing hardship for growth:

*   **"Everything that you want is on the other side of worse first."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>
    *   This principle suggests that initial steps towards significant goals often involve negative experiences. For example, getting a better body means enduring the initial discomfort and soreness of going to the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. Changing careers involves the difficulty of learning new skills or going through job interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>. The immediate future may seem worse if one opts for change, which is why many people hit a plateau and never move past it â€“ they are unwilling to endure "that hard day, month, week, year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>.
    *   Weaver advises making decisions based on what your five-year-future self would wish you had done now, knowing that the initial period might be painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

*   **"Life is suffering, so choose something worth suffering for."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:51">[02:40:51]</a>
    *   Regardless of one's path, suffering is inevitable. Graham's first job, though "safe" and well-paying, still involved long hours and missing personal time, which he described as "suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The key is to direct that effort towards something one genuinely cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. When pursuing a passion, the energy and dedication increase dramatically, leading to a "superpower" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

## The Role of Time and Mindset in [[resilience_and_persistence_in_startups | Resilience and Persistence in Startups]]

Graham shares his own entrepreneurial journey with Alpine Investors as a prime example of the long road to success:

*   Alpine initially lost money on its first fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:22">[02:28:22]</a> and faced significant challenges during the recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. Five of his first eight investments resulted in losses, which is a poor ratio for a private equity firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   It took him 14 years to be confident that the firm would even stay in business, and 18 years to be considered "really successful" by external standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   The "missing ingredient" in most failures is time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. The primary factor is the individual's willingness to stick with it, influenced by their belief about how long things are supposed to take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

## When to Quit vs. Persist

Graham draws a clear distinction between persistent effort and quitting:

*   **Ultimate failure is quitting.** Graham considers his decision to quit wrestling in high school after losing a match his only true failure because he gave up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. In contrast, his repeated failures in collegiate rowing ultimately led to success because he kept going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.
*   **The time to quit is when:**
    *   You can no longer see the vision.
    *   You can no longer truly believe the vision.
    *   You are no longer excited about the vision (though caution is advised, as dark days can obscure excitement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.

## [[overcoming_failures_and_setbacks_in_career | Overcoming Failures and Setbacks in Career]] through "Scaling Bright Spots"

Even in periods of struggle, there are often "bright spots" that can be identified and amplified. Graham describes how Alpine, despite its early challenges, consistently looked for what was working:
*   They made fewer mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>.
*   They started seeing things work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.
*   They made one good deal in a fund and learned from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.
*   They made one good hire and learned from that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.

This process of "scaling your bright spots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>, as described by Dan and Chip, allowed them to build their entire business strategy, hiring practices, and operations around what was successful, eventually turning the whole business into a "bright spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This emphasizes that persistence isn't just brute force, but also adaptive learning from [[challenges_and_failures_in_experimentation | challenges and failures in experimentation]].

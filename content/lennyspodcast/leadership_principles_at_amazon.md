Amazon's [[leadership_and_company_culture | leadership principles]] are foundational to its operations, guiding decisions and fostering a unique company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. Ethan Evans, a former Vice President at Amazon, noted that the company has undergone approximately four major revisions of its [[leadership_and_company_culture | leadership principles]] over its 25+ year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. Every word in these principles is meticulously studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>.

Ethan Evans, who spent 15 years at Amazon and holds over 70 patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, helped draft one of Amazon's 14 core [[leadership_and_company_culture | leadership principles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. These principles, such as "Think Big" and "Invent and Simplify," encourage a forward-thinking and innovative approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

## Key Leadership Principles

### Ownership

The principle of [[the_importance_of_ownership_in_leadership | Ownership]] emphasizes accountability and proactive problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. Initially removed during a revision from earlier lists, it was advocated for reinstatement by Jeff Wilkie, the former head of retail, and a group of directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. Ethan Evans proposed the key phrase that became part of the principle: "an owner never says 'that's not my job'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. This phrase signifies a commitment to taking responsibility beyond one's immediate tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

Ethan Evans considers these seven words to be the most impactful thing he has ever written, given that 1.5 million Amazon employees adhere to these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. He highlights that this demonstrates how individuals can influence a company significantly if their ideas are good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>.

### Bias for Action

"Bias for Action" underscores the importance of speed in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. Many decisions are reversible, making it crucial to move quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. In a competitive environment, being correct is valuable, but being swift is necessary to avoid being outmaneuvered by competitors who might take earlier, successful gambles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. This principle necessitates a process that prioritizes speed and immediate commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. However, it also requires balance, as demonstrated by Ethan Evans' experience with a public product launch failure where his bias for action led to issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.

### Invent and Simplify

This principle encourages continuous innovation and simplification of processes and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. Ethan Evans, initially not considering himself an inventor, systematically learned to be inventive by dedicating focused time to problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. He emphasizes that significant invention doesn't require constant effort; often, two hours once a month can be sufficient for generating a good idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The real work lies in the years it takes to express and optimize that idea, similar to the continuous improvement of Amazon Prime or the Kindle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

A straightforward approach to invention involves combining existing concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. For example, Evans patented a drone delivery system that uses a truck as a mobile base, combining the concepts of drones and aircraft carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. This highlights that much of Amazon's innovation is rooted in optimization and incremental improvements rather than entirely new concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

### Leaders are Right, A Lot / Seek Diverse Perspectives

The principle "Leaders are Right, A Lot" has been modified to emphasize that leaders should actively work to disconfirm their beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. This means remaining open and constantly questioning assumptions based on new evidence and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. It also encourages seeking diverse perspectives to ensure decisions are made for Amazon's entire customer base, not just a specific demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.

### Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

This principle encourages leaders to challenge decisions respectfully but commit fully once a decision is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>. Ethan Evans values candidates who can demonstrate times they disagreed with management and fought for a position against higher [[leadership_lessons_from_mark_zuckerberg | leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. Having people who can say "yes" is not always helpful; what is needed are individuals with "backbone" who can disagree and then commit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>.

## Impact of Principles on Career Progression

Adherence to these principles and [[lessons_in_leadership_and_team_management | leadership insights]] plays a crucial role in career advancement within Amazon. For instance, the "Magic Loop" is a five-step process designed to help individuals grow their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>:
1.  **Do your current job well:** Ensure your manager perceives your performance as solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
2.  **Ask your boss how you can help:** This sets you apart and builds a team-oriented relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
3.  **Do what they ask:** Even if it's not your preferred work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
4.  **Align their needs with your goals:** Propose ways to help your manager that also support your career aspirations (e.g., skill development, promotion, role change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
5.  **Repeat:** Continuously apply this loop to build trust and a partnership with your manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

This "Magic Loop" helps clarify expectations and allows individuals to proactively shape their career paths, rather than waiting for a manager who may be too busy or ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. It leverages the human tendency for managers to help those who help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

For senior managers (e.g., L7, M1, M2 levels), advancing to director or VP often requires a shift from functional expertise to influence, coordination, and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. This aligns with the idea that "what got you here won't get you there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. To overcome being stuck, individuals should start practicing next-level skills, take on strategic projects, and become more inventive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. Demonstrating the ability to do the job before having the title is crucial for promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

**Lesson from Failure: Rebuilding Trust**

When facing a significant failure, like Ethan Evans's problematic App Store launch that drew Jeff Bezos's anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>:
*   **Own the mistake:** Immediately admit responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
*   **Prioritize and communicate proactively:** Provide frequent updates on progress, showing you are in control and working to fix the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. This prevents micromanagement and rebuilds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
*   **Face the situation in person:** In-person interactions can defuse anger more effectively than written communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.
*   **Work hard and fast:** Pull out all stops to recover, even if it's uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
*   **Address human impact:** Reassure team members who might feel undue responsibility, especially junior ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.
*   **Learn and adapt:** Adopt new approaches, such as extensive beta testing to avoid "surprise launches" that might reveal unexpected problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.
*   **Persevere:** Despite being considered for termination, Evans's stubbornness and continued effort led to his promotion to Vice President two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>. This illustrates that a single major mistake does not necessarily end a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

Many perceived "execution problems" in high-performing environments are often rooted in deeper issues related to [[Strategy formulation and execution | strategy]] or [[Company Culture and Decision Making | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Leaders frequently find themselves overwhelmed by a continuous cycle of solving execution problems, only for new ones to emerge, likened to a "vacuum hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>.

## Execution Problems Explained

While true execution problems exist—such as outdated infrastructure causing slow performance or outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>, or a [[Role of company culture in product management | skills gap]] within a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>—many apparent execution issues are actually symptoms of underlying strategic, cultural, or interpersonal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>.

A tell-tale sign that an execution problem isn't truly an execution problem is when "band-aids" are applied, but the problem persistently reappears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>. Organizations with short memories may repeatedly try to solve the same problem with temporary fixes, rather than addressing the root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

### Example: Team Misalignment

Consider a common scenario where two teams are misaligned, impacting their ability to hit OKRs and overall execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Leaders often respond by implementing new review processes or mandating regular one-on-one meetings between managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>. However, these solutions are often insufficient if the root cause is not addressed.

### Strategy Problems

Team misalignment often stems from [[Strategy formulation and execution | strategy problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>:
*   **Conflicting Strategies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>: Teams may be pursuing different strategic directions.
*   **Lack of Clarity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>: More commonly, teams don't know what the overall strategy is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. This leads to unaligned OKRs, unclear priorities, and an inability to adapt when reality changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.
Meetings then devolve into arguments over "minutiae" like feature work or resource allocation, instead of addressing the fundamental strategic disconnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

### Culture Problems

Another common root cause for misalignment is a [[the_role_of_organizational_culture_in_experimentation_success | culture problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>:
*   **OKR Optimization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>: If the [[Leadership and company culture | organizational culture]] primarily incentivizes individual teams to optimize for their own OKRs, cross-team collaboration becomes incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. Teams might be penalized for helping other teams if it negatively impacts their own metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.
*   **Recurring Manifestation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:45">[01:09:45]</a>: Simply setting up more meetings won't solve a deep-seated [[Impact of culture on team dynamics and decision making | cultural issue]]; the execution problem will continue to manifest in different forms down the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

### Interpersonal Problems

Sometimes, the root cause is as simple as an [[Impact of culture on team dynamics and decision making | interpersonal problem]] where two key managers "cannot get along" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>. As a leader, it's crucial to identify this and coach individuals through their differences so they can work together more effectively. Solving this fundamental issue eliminates the need for numerous ineffective meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding the true nature of "execution problems" requires looking beyond the surface. By recognizing whether an issue is a [[difference_between_good_and_bad_strategy | strategy]], [[cultivating_an_entrepreneurial_culture_within_organizations | culture]], or interpersonal problem, leaders can address the root cause rather than perpetually applying temporary fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. This approach leads to more sustainable solutions and prevents the constant cycle of new "execution problems" appearing.

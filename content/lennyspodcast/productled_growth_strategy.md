[[Productled growth strategy | Product-led growth]] (PLG) is a specific approach to a growth model where a company is product-led in how it acquires, retains, and monetizes customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. It emphasizes leveraging product usage to drive sales and growth, contrasting with traditional sales-led approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

## Product-Led vs. Sales-Led: A Layering Game

The most successful companies do not choose between being product-led or sales-led; instead, they are able to execute both correctly and together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Viewing it as a binary decision is a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. The approach should be a "layering game" where one growth model is introduced, and the next is layered on top to amplify existing growth, rather than switching entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

If a company is currently sales-led, continuing with only that approach leaves it vulnerable to disruption by a product-led company from the bottom up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Moving from sales-led to product-led does not mean abandoning sales-led strategies; it means strengthening the sales-led approach and overlaying product-led initiatives to amplify existing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. Eventually, companies will need to do both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

## Core Components of Product-Led Growth

A growth model addresses three fundamental questions: how to acquire, retain, and monetize customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. A company can choose to be product-led, marketing-led, or sales-led across all or some of these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

### Prioritizing Product-Led Retention
Every company must first focus on being product-led in retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. This is the only way to have a chance at product-led acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Retention involves two key performance indicators: activation and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. If a product cannot activate and engage users through habitual loops, it has no chance of hooking an acquisition engine into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. [[Implementing productled growth | Product-led acquisition]] relies on users buying, referring, or creating content that attracts other users, which is impossible without habitual product use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.

### The Role of Collaboration in PLG
For a product to effectively implement a product-led acquisition model, it typically needs a one-to-many relationship or collaboration at its core, like Slack or Miro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Products without this relationship find it much harder to establish product-led acquisition and often rely on [[marketing_strategies_and_growth | marketing-led]] and sales-led approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

### Monetization
Product-led monetization can occur through self-serve options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. If an industry or sector doesn't yet have product-led sales or self-serve, it is guaranteed to emerge within the next 10 years, and companies risk disruption if they don't introduce it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

## The Downfall of PLG: When Sales "Crushes" Product-Led Growth

A common pattern sees product-led companies gain user love, strong retention, and successful self-serve monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. As they aggregate multiple users within an organization, they get closer to their first Enterprise contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. The excitement of large average contract values (ACVs) leads companies to double down on hiring sales people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

Initially, this works well due to strong existing usage and advocates, with Enterprise buyers often already in the user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. However, growth inevitably slows because companies run out of Enterprise buyers within their user base, as only 30% or less of buyers are also users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. This requires going upmarket to find buyers, leading to investments in Enterprise marketing, demand generation, and larger deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

The crucial mistake most companies make is letting go of their product usage growth and product-led tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Resource prioritization shifts towards hiring Enterprise sales representatives and ABM specialists instead of growth product managers or marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. This disconnects the original product-led growth engine, causing Enterprise pipeline to dry up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

Many companies, roughly 80%, abandon product-led initiatives for Enterprise sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. This leads to a massive slowdown in Enterprise pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. Some overcorrect and reinvest in product-led growth, while others pivot entirely to a top-down sales machine, which requires a very different structure and profiles of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. Companies should never forget their product-led roots, especially if that was their original DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.

### Avoiding the Downfall
Founders can avoid this by understanding that:
*   **ACVs are not comparable:** Product-led growth often results in lower initial average contract values (ACVs) because accounts are engaged earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. [[Productled sales strategy | PLG]] is an expansion game, not about landing the largest deal from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. Teams should be incentivized correctly for this model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.
*   **Product roadmap focus:** A red flag is when the product roadmap exclusively focuses on Enterprise features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. Companies must continuously innovate and delight users to ensure they remain the "selling agent" within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

## Product-Led Sales: The Future of Growth

[[Productled sales strategy | Product-led sales]] is predicted to eventually "box out" top-down sales organizations because it focuses on user value that drives expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.

### Advantages of Product-Led Sales
*   **Cost of Acquisition:** It has an incredibly low cost of acquisition because it focuses on acquiring a user, which is much cheaper than a buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.
*   **Pipeline Creation:** [[Sales involvement in productled growth | Product-led sales]] creates pipeline based on usage, rather than marketing qualified leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>. This usage drives additional growth hooks, opportunities for acquisition, retention, product building, and discovery of adjacent use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
*   **Empowering Users:** It empowers users to make purchasing decisions and act as sales agents, pushing sales pressure onto the product and its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.
*   **User-Centric Decision Making:** Enterprise buyers are increasingly being removed from the initial decision-making process, as users are driving the adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. If the user is making the decision, [[productled_sales_strategy | product-led sales]] is the best way to capture that intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.

### How Product-Led Sales Works
1.  **Usage-Based Acquisition:** It starts with acquisition (either marketing or product-led) and some form of self-serve usage (freemium or self-serve monetization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. The product must be able to generate usage without human involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
2.  **Network Effects & Qualification:** Companies identify how closely users are approaching a point where the entire enterprise would benefit from the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. This often involves observing network effects within the organization's user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
3.  **Product Qualification Model:** Users are scored based on metrics like usage volume, velocity, breadth of feature use, behavioral tactics, demographics, or specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. This scoring determines the probability of successfully selling to the entire organization based on existing usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
4.  **Sales Involvement:**
    *   **Hand-raisers:** The primary goal is to create "hand-raisers" â€“ users who organically complete a sales lead form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.
    *   **Outbound:** The second layer involves identifying users who act like hand-raisers but haven't formally raised their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>. Sales then proactively reaches out to find an Enterprise buyer or get introduced through the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
    *   In essence, [[productled_sales_strategy | product-led sales]] uses the product as the sales enablement material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.

In contrast, traditional sales-led approaches start with marketing qualified leads or outbound prospecting to find a buyer, relying on demos and persuasion before any product usage occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.

## Freemium vs. Trials

Elena Verna is a strong advocate for freemium models over trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

### Definitions
*   **Freemium:** Users are allowed to use the product in some free capacity, often with feature or usage walls, but with an ongoing, "forever" free component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>.
*   **Trial:** Users are allowed to use the product for a specific, time-bound period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

### Why Freemium is Preferred
Trials create a superficial time-bound constraint that doesn't account for varying user needs or organizational complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. A 7-day trial might be sufficient for a small startup but completely alienate a large enterprise with many dependencies, which might need months to truly evaluate a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. This artificial time pressure is not a good measure of how long it takes to derive value from a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

A better approach is a usage-based freemium, like MongoDB's free community cluster, which allows users to play around without a time limit, pushing production use cases into paid monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. Even high-friction B2B products like Snowflake and Okta are increasingly offering some version of freemium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.

### Strategic Reasons for Freemium
The biggest mistake is viewing freemium solely as a conversion rate optimization tactic for paid products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. There must be a clear strategic reason for offering freemium that drives business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
Freemium can:
*   **Drive Indirect Monetization:** Promote virality or network effects, like Miro's free editable boards or SurveyMonkey's free user base, which drove 100% of their acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.
*   **Serve as a POC (Proof of Concept):** Allow users to experience the "Aha! moment" without friction, as seen with MongoDB's free cluster for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.
*   **Enable Strategic Landing:** Land with a segment that isn't immediately monetized but offers future expansion opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.
*   **Address Commoditization:** If an offering is commoditized, freemium becomes necessary to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.
*   **Create Habit Loops:** Offer features like notifications or communication channels for free to build user habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>.
*   **Foster Product Innovation:** Act as a breeding ground for discovering adjacent use cases and personas, allowing companies to pivot their roadmap and stay ahead of trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.
*   **Collect Data:** Gather data that allows for building new products, like LinkedIn leveraging its freemium base to build Sales Navigator and recruiting products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

Anything that creates friction for the growth model should be gated in the paid offering, while anything that promotes the growth model should be put into the free offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

## [[Implementing productled growth | Implementing Product-Led Growth]] through Hiring

Growth is an evolution, not a revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. The more an organization can evolve to have a growth mindset, the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

### Finding a Growth Leader
It is often best to find the first growth hire internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. This could be a data analyst, product manager, or engineer who is technically inclined and connected to the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>.

Bringing someone external, especially as a first hire, carries significant risk because they are unfamiliar with the company's specific product and how its growth model should function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. Copying a previous company's growth model often fails due to the unique nature of each product and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. External hires need significant time (3-6 months or more) to understand the company's specific growth model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>. If pressured to accelerate growth immediately, they will resort to copy-pasting strategies, which rarely works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.

### When to Hire a Full-Time Growth Person
A company should only consider hiring a full-time growth person after achieving a strong product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>. This means:
1.  **Retention:** Demonstrable customer retention, which typically takes at least six months to a year post-initial offering to truly measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>.
2.  **Acquisition & Monetization:** Some initial ability to acquire and monetize customers, showing "green shoots" in driving product distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

Hiring a growth person to "figure out" the growth model from the beginning is a mistake and a delegation of a critical founding team responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. The founding team should create the initial growth model themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.

## General Tips for Growth
The key to [[growth_hacking_and_sustainable_growth_strategies | sustainable growth strategies]] is to understand how to find patterns in the problems being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Rather than treating each problem individually, developing frameworks for solutions allows for scaling, repeatability, and competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>. Minimizing "context switching" is crucial for creating a repeatable, sustainable, and competitively defensible growth model that fosters a growth culture and mindset across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.

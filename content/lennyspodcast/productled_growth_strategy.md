[[effective_growth_frameworks | Growth strategy]] is a sequential game, focusing on layering different approaches rather than switching between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The most successful companies execute both product-led and sales-led motions correctly and together, rather than picking one over the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Viewing it as a binary decision is a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Elena Verna, a leading expert in [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth strategy]], has led growth at companies like Miro, SurveyMonkey, and Amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>, and has advised others including MongoDB, Netlify, and HP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Her insights cover B2B [[growth_frameworks_and_strategies | growth strategies]], the evolving B2B landscape, the benefits of freemium over trial models, [[effective_growth_frameworks | product-led growth strategy]], [[working_with_sales_in_a_productled_growth_company | product-led sales]], and hiring growth leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Evolution of B2B Growth Strategy

B2B products are increasingly becoming "shiny and fun," similar to consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Traditionally, B2B purchasing decisions were made by enterprise buyers looking for utility and efficiency, often resulting in cold, unusable interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

However, in the last decade, decision-making power has shifted towards the "prosumer" or employee, leading to a new wave of B2B products that are consumer-like in terms of user experience, habit formation, and integration into daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This shift is driven by a redefinition of the "customer" from an enterprise buyer to an actual user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

Key elements of this consumerization include:
*   Improved onboarding and time-to-value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>
*   Enhanced activation experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>
*   Creation of habitual loops within the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>
*   Increased user affinity and advocacy, leading to word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>

Examples of companies that succeeded by building for users, not just enterprise buyers, include Slack, Miro, and Amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. These companies see users bringing the software into their organizations, leading enterprise buyers to pay up based on observed utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Understanding Product-Led Growth (PLG)

[[effective_growth_frameworks | Product-led growth]] refers to being product-led in your growth model, which addresses three key questions: how to acquire, retain, and monetize customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

*   **Bottoms-Up**: This term primarily refers to acquisition and monetization levers, where usage generates leads for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Product-led is essentially a rebranding of bottoms-up, emphasizing that the product itself generates leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Product-Led Acquisition**: Relies on "hand raisers" and product qualification criteria that lead to enterprise contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

### Prioritizing PLG Motions

Every company should first focus on being product-led in **retention** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
1.  **Product-Led Retention**: This involves nailing activation and engagement through habitual loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. If users aren't habitually using the product, there's little opportunity for product-led acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
2.  **Product-Led Acquisition**: This comes *after* strong product-led retention is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. It works best when the product has a "one-to-many" relationship or collaboration at its core (e.g., Slack, Miro), allowing users to invite others and create network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

If a product doesn't have inherent one-to-many relationships (e.g., Snowflake), product-led acquisition becomes more challenging, requiring reliance on marketing-led and sales-led approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### The Downfall of Neglecting PLG Roots

Many companies that start as product-led and gain user love and word-of-mouth often make a crucial mistake when they scale: they double down on hiring sales teams to chase large enterprise contracts, neglecting their original product-led growth tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

The pattern of decline:
1.  **Initial Sales Success**: Strong user adoption initially provides a robust pipeline as sales close existing users within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Slowdown**: Companies eventually run out of enterprise buyers already in their user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Most often, the buyer is not the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
3.  **Resource Prioritization Shift**: Companies prioritize hiring enterprise sales and marketing (e.g., ABM specialists) over growth PMs or marketers, disconnecting from their product usage growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
4.  **Drying Pipeline**: Neglecting continuous user growth, community building, and habitual loops leads to a massive slowdown in enterprise pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
5.  **Reinvestment or Pivot**: Many realize their mistake and reinvest in product-led growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Others pivot entirely to a top-down sales machine, which requires a completely different work structure and talent profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

> "The game is a layering game; it's a sequential game. Which one will you introduce first, and how can you layer the next one on top of it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>

To avoid this pitfall:
*   **Don't Compare ACVs**: Product-led sales typically lead to lower initial Average Contract Values (ACVs) because you engage accounts earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. PLG and [[differences_between_productled_growth_and_productled_sales | product-led sales]] are expansion games, not "land at the most from the beginning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Exclusive Enterprise Features**: If your product roadmap focuses *exclusively* on enterprise features, it's a sign you've neglected user growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Continue to innovate and delight users; they are your selling agents within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

## [[differences_between_productled_growth_and_productled_sales | Product-Led Sales (PLS)]]

[[differences_between_productled_growth_and_productled_sales | Product-led sales]] is predicted to become the future of growth, eventually "boxing out" traditional top-down sales organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

Key characteristics of [[differences_between_productled_growth_and_productled_sales | product-led sales]]:
*   **Focus on User Value**: It drives expansion by empowering users to be sales agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: It acquires users, which is cheaper than acquiring buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Usage-Driven Pipeline**: Pipeline creation is based on actual product usage, not just marketing qualified leads (MQLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **User-Centric Decision Making**: Enterprise buyers are increasingly boxed out of the initial decision-making process, as users are making choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

**Product-Led Sales Flow**:
1.  **Acquisition & Self-Serve Usage**: Starts with acquisition (marketing or product-led) leading to self-serve usage (freemium or self-serve monetization) without human involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
2.  **Product Qualification**: Based on usage, companies identify when an entire enterprise would benefit from the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This often involves network effects within the organization (e.g., team collaboration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
3.  **Scoring & Sales Involvement**: Users are scored based on usage volume, velocity, feature breadth, behavior, or demographics to predict the probability of a successful enterprise sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This is when sales gets involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Hand Raisers**: First, optimize for users who actively request sales contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Outbound**: Second, identify users who *act* like hand-raisers but haven't formally contacted sales, and proactively reach out to them or their enterprise buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
4.  **Product as Sales Enablement**: The product itself becomes the sales enablement material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

This contrasts with traditional sales-led models that rely on MQLs, outbound prospecting to find buyers, extensive demos, and efforts to convince them to purchase before usage occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## Freemium vs. Trials

Elena Verna strongly advocates for freemium models over time-bound trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

*   **Freemium**: Allows indefinite free usage, typically with feature or usage walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   **Trial**: Allows free usage for a limited, time-bound period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

The main issue with time-bound trials is that the time needed to evaluate a product varies greatly between users and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. A 7-day trial might work for a small startup but alienate a large enterprise that needs months due to dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
Instead of time, freemium should be based on a usage metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. A great example is MongoDB's freemium, which offers a free, shared community cluster, allowing users to experiment without time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Strategic Reasons for Freemium

Freemium should be a strategic decision, not just a simple offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
The strategic value of freemium includes:
*   **Proof of Concept (POC)**: Allows users to test the product's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
*   **Indirect Monetization (Virality/Network Effects)**: Free users can drive acquisition by sharing and collaborating, even if they never pay (e.g., Miro's three editable boards, SurveyMonkey's free user base driving acquisition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Land**: Helps land customers in segments you might not monetize initially but intend to expand with later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Commoditization**: If your core offering is becoming commoditized, giving it away for free becomes necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Product Innovation/Discovery**: Freemium can serve as a breeding ground for discovering adjacent use cases and personas, informing future roadmap decisions (e.g., LinkedIn's freemium base enabling their paid recruiting products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Data Collection**: Gather data on user behavior to improve and build new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

The core principle is: "Anything that actually creates friction for my growth model, I'll probably gated in the paid. Anything that promotes my growth model, I will put it into free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

## Hiring for Growth

Hiring for growth, particularly a growth leader, requires a strategic approach.

*   **Growth as Evolution, Not Revolution**: It's often best to find a growth hire internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. An internal candidate (e.g., data analyst, product manager, engineer) is already familiar with the product and its specific growth model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   **Risks of External Hires**: Bringing in an external hire too early can be risky, as they might try to "copy-paste" a growth model from a previous company, which rarely works due to differences in product function and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This often leads to failure and high turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
*   **When to Hire**: A full-time growth person should only be brought in once a strong product-market fit is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. This means having proven retention (at least 6-12 months post-launch) and initial ability to acquire and monetize customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Founding Team Responsibility**: The founding team must create the initial growth model themselves; delegating this crucial early stage to an external hire is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## General Tips for Driving Growth

*   **Find Patterns**: The most important advice for growth is to understand how to find patterns in the problems you are solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Develop Frameworks**: Instead of approaching each problem individually, develop frameworks for solving them. This makes scaling easier, more successful, and sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.
*   **Minimize Context Switching**: This is key to creating a repeatable, sustainable, and competitively defensible growth model that fosters a [[new_company_approach_and_the_shift_from_traditional_growth_strategies | growth culture]] and mindset across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

Shreyas Doshi, a seasoned product leader with experience at companies like Yahoo, Google, Twitter, and Stripe, shares his insights on various aspects of product management, including the crucial practice of premortems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. This technique, often overlooked, can significantly improve project outcomes by identifying potential failures before they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

## What is a Premortem?

A premortem is a proactive project management ritual designed to identify potential risks and failures *before* a project begins or a launch occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. It's a contrast to a postmortem (or "after action review" in military terms), which analyzes failures *after* they happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

The core idea is to gather the team early in a project's lifecycle and imagine that the project has "miserably failed" six months from now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. From this hypothetical failure point, the team then works backward to determine what went wrong and what could have contributed to the utter failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.

> "If you do a premortem right, you will not have to do an ugly postmortem. You might still do a postmortem to learn, but odds are very high that it is not going to be a bad post-mortem." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>

## Why Premortems Work

Premortems derive their effectiveness from two key factors:

1.  **Psychological Safety**: Modern organizations often discourage negativity, leading team members to hesitate in vocalizing concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>. A premortem, by framing the discussion around a *hypothetical* failure, grants everyone the explicit license to think about and articulate what could go wrong, fostering a safe environment for open feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. This provides a "great catharsis" for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.
2.  **Shared Vocabulary**: The structured approach of a premortem establishes a common language for discussing potential threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. This shared vocabulary helps teams proactively address issues and ensures that concerns aren't just dismissed or assumed to be someone else's problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

## The Premortem Process

Shreyas Doshi outlines a specific template and process for conducting effective premortems, which he developed and shared in a [[coda.io|Coda]] doc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>:

### Participants
It is essential to include people from every function involved in the project or launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.

*   **For large launches**: It can be beneficial to separate into two groups:
    *   **Product Engineering**: Involves every engineer (potentially 10-20), product managers, and design counterparts to focus on technical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.
    *   **Go-to-Market**: Includes sales, support, marketing, PR teams, and core engineering leads to discuss go-to-market risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **For smaller launches**: A single meeting with all relevant stakeholders is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.

### Meeting Structure
1.  **The Prompt**: The leader initiates the meeting with the core prompt: "Imagine this project that we are working on has failed six months from now, or this launch we are doing has miserably failed. Let's just all imagine that. Now let's work backwards from there and ask ourselves, what went wrong? What could have contributed to this utter failure?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>
2.  **Quiet Time**: After the prompt, allocate 5-10 minutes of quiet time for participants to privately enter their concerns into a shared document (like the [[coda.io|Coda]] template) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.
3.  **Sharing & Categorization**: Go around the room and have each person share their insights, categorizing potential failures into three types:
    *   **Tiger**: A threat that "will actually kill us," representing genuinely problematic issues that could be harmful to the product or project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.
    *   **Paper Tiger**: A seeming threat that others might worry about, but you personally are not concerned about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.
    *   **Elephant**: The "elephant in the room" that nobody is talking about; it might not kill the project, but the team isn't seeing reality as it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. Examples include assuming user adoption without clear plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.
4.  **Voting on Scariest Threats**: Participants vote on the "scariest" tiger mentioned by *someone else*, which helps in prioritizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.
5.  **Post-Premortem Action Plan**: The leader is responsible for taking the team's output, prioritizing the identified threats, and creating a mitigating action plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. The goal is not to solve every problem but to identify key unaddressed threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

## Impact of Premortems

Teams that regularly conduct premortems often identify issues that would otherwise go unnoticed, potentially leading to significant problems later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. Many public blunders or backtracks by companies could have been avoided with a premortem, as these issues are often obvious to some team members but lack the psychological safety or vocabulary to be openly discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.

Premortems are a "very low downside but very high upside" investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. They involve just one meeting followed by a leader's prioritization and implementation of mitigating actions that would likely be necessary anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. This proactive approach saves time, resources, and prevents public backlash that often wastes significant time in damage control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.

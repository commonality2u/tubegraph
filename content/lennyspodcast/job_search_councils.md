Job Search Councils are support groups comprising six to eight job seekers who commit to supporting each other through the job search process [00:02:52]. While not exclusively for product people, the concept emerged from and is largely embraced by the product community [00:03:00, 02:00:04].

## Purpose and Benefits

The primary goal of Job Search Councils is to help individuals find a job they love by providing practical, battle-tested methods [00:02:29]. They aim to transform the job search from a solitary, anxiety-inducing experience into one of hope, motivation, accountability, and confidence [00:04:10].

Key benefits include:
*   **Combating Insecurity and Anxiety** Everyone, regardless of seniority (including CEOs and CPOs), feels insecure and anxious during a job search [00:03:30, 02:29:26]. Doing it alone magnifies these feelings [00:03:52]. Councils flip this anxiety into positive emotions by encouraging openness, vulnerability, and [[the_importance_of_asking_for_help_in_job_searches | asking for help]] [00:04:01].
*   **Shared Learning and Accountability** Members share their experiences, providing [[questions_for_career_reflection | insights]] and feedback that might be overlooked when searching alone [00:23:51]. The group structure provides accountability to stay on track [00:14:41].
*   **Emotional Balance Management** The most important thing to manage during a job search is one's emotional balance [00:14:05]. Councils help job seekers, who often have more liabilities (fear, anxiety) than assets on their "emotional balance sheet," overcome demoralization and keep going [00:14:16].
*   **Disrupting Traditional Job Search Methods** The approach aims to disrupt the conventional "spray and pray" method, which is common when people get laid off [00:22:12, 00:00:30].

## History and Origins

The concept of Job Search Councils was formalized by Phil Terry, author of *Never Search Alone*, who observed that [[job_search_strategies | successful job searching]] often involves collaborative effort [00:04:28, 00:00:58].

*   **Early Councils** Phil Terry established his first council over 40 years ago, and then CEO Councils for internet CEOs in the mid-1990s [00:04:46].
*   **Maternal Inspiration** The core idea originated from Phil's mother, who, in 1960, formed a council of newly minted elementary school teachers in the San Fernando Valley [00:05:02]. This group met for 50 years, supporting each other in their careers [00:05:15]. This method proved effective even in tough job markets; in the mid-1970s, his mother, a single middle-aged woman with children, found a job with the council's support, despite her [[candidate_market_fit | Candidate Market Fit]] being terrible and her having to take an entry-level teaching position [00:05:27, 00:06:07].
*   **Dot-Com Bubble Burst** The methodology was further developed when Phil helped hundreds of people with their job searches after the dot-com bubble burst, leading to a depression in the industry [00:06:22].

## Structure and Operations

Job Search Councils are a completely free, volunteer-driven initiative [00:09:18, 00:09:21]. Over 2,000 councils have been launched, with over 20,000 hours of volunteer work contributed [00:09:15, 00:09:37]. All book sales from *Never Search Alone* go towards running these councils [00:09:54].

### How to Join
To join a council, individuals can apply at `phil.org` [00:10:32].

### Matching and Cadence
Applicants are separated into two categories [00:10:43]:
*   **Slow Seekers**: Individuals who are currently employed but looking for a new job [00:10:52]. These councils typically meet every two weeks [00:11:15].
*   **Fast Seekers**: Individuals who are currently out of work [00:10:57]. These councils typically meet twice a week [00:11:13].

### Moderator Role
Every council needs a moderator, who is a job seeker volunteering for the role [00:11:03]. Moderators receive faster matching, more training, and additional support [00:11:13]. As of the transcript, 2,000 moderators have been trained [00:11:23].

### Process Overview
1.  **Application and Matching**: Apply online and get matched to a council [00:10:32, 00:10:37].
2.  **Orientation**: Participate in a live orientation program that explains how the councils work and what to expect in the first meeting [00:11:31].
3.  **Resources**: Access hundreds of pages of tools, agendas, materials, and a free 100-page workbook with templates and guides [00:09:24, 00:11:42].
4.  **Meeting Zero**: The moderator brings the group together for a "Meeting Zero" where members share personal stories to build trust and understanding [00:12:01].
5.  **Ongoing Support**: Councils continue to meet until all members find a job [00:12:23].

## Core Methodologies

Job Search Councils integrate several key concepts to enhance the job search:

### Candidate Market Fit
This is considered the most important [[job_search_strategies | job search strategy]] apart from the council itself [00:30:30]. It acknowledges that the job seeker is a "product" (their skills and experience) in a marketplace with supply and demand [00:24:49]. In down markets, increased supply (e.g., due to layoffs in tech) can push down one's "fit" [00:21:00]. Understanding this market dynamic is a relief as it's "not about you" personally [00:21:55].

*   **Manukan Two-Pager**: This is a radical first step where individuals define what they want and what they don't want in a job [00:22:01, 00:23:02]. It's a draft that can be iterated upon and shared with the council for feedback and refinement [00:23:48, 00:24:10].
*   **Listening Tour**: After the Manukan Two-Pager, job seekers conduct a "listening tour" to understand what the market wants and gather feedback on their fit [00:24:42, 00:24:56]. This involves asking trusted friends, former colleagues (reverse exit interviews), and recruiters for advice and perspective [00:24:58, 00:27:16]. The "golden question" to ask is, "If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this?" [00:25:17]. This tour not only provides market research but also turns contacts into "listening posts" invested in the job seeker's success [00:26:18, 00:26:29].
*   **Narrow Focus**: After the listening tour, job seekers create a narrow, clear [[candidate_market_fit | Candidate Market Fit]] statement, typically with three to four attributes (e.g., role level, industry, company stage, culture) [00:31:13, 00:33:33, 00:35:19]. While counterintuitive, a narrow focus helps people in one's network more easily identify potential opportunities [00:31:51]. This is akin to a product needing a narrow initial audience [00:33:15]. This statement is then shared with the network and posted on LinkedIn [00:34:15, 00:34:25]. The market conditions can change, requiring flexibility and adaptation of the [[candidate_market_fit | Candidate Market Fit]] [00:34:36].

### Playing to Win

This involves taking charge during interviews and [[negotiation_tactics_for_job_offers | negotiations]], not out of ruthlessness, but from a position of confidence and preparation [00:39:41, 00:41:42].

*   **Job Mission with OKRs**: Job seekers create their own version of the job description, detailing a "Job Mission with OKRs" (Objectives and Key Results) for the role they are interviewing for [00:50:28]. This document is initially kept private but helps formulate insightful interview questions [00:51:16, 00:51:21].
*   **Presenting the OKRs**: After initial interviews, the job seeker presents their draft Job Mission with OKRs to the hiring manager [00:51:33, 00:51:40]. This demonstrates initiative, accountability, and the ability to deliver outcomes, often impressing hiring managers [00:51:56, 00:59:51]. It also helps clarify the role and ensure alignment, preventing "job A turning out to be job B" [00:53:00, 00:53:20].
*   **Negotiating for Success**: The Job Mission with OKRs sets the stage for a collaborative [[negotiation_tactics_for_job_offers | negotiation]] about factors critical for success beyond salary, such as budget for tech debt, team training, or hiring additional staff [00:53:43, 00:56:02]. Even for junior roles, this can include mentorship or professional development opportunities [00:56:16]. This shows the company a genuine desire to succeed and is often welcomed, potentially leading to better overall compensation and long-term career growth [00:56:08, 00:58:08]. Even if the company cannot meet all demands, it allows the job seeker to enter the role with "eyes wide open" to potential constraints [00:58:32].

### The Importance of Asking for Help

[[the_importance_of_asking_for_help_in_job_searches | Asking for help]] is central to the Job Search Council philosophy [01:11:16].

*   **Not a Weakness**: Asking for help is not a sign of weakness but a sign of confidence [01:14:57]. It requires confidence and strengthens it [01:15:02].
*   **Giving Activity**: When done well, asking for help is a giving activity; it makes the person asked feel valued and honored [01:15:07, 01:16:15].
*   **Increases Independence**: Paradoxically, asking for help fosters greater independence, accountability, and responsibility by leveraging external perspectives [01:16:35, 01:14:57].
*   **Improves Reputation**: It improves, rather than harms, one's reputation [01:16:37].
*   **Doing it Well**: To ask for help effectively, one must do their homework, be clear and honest about what they're asking, and consider the existing relationship with the person being asked [01:14:49, 01:27:03, 01:27:56]. The Job Search Council provides a safe environment to practice this [01:27:19].

### Emotional Support and Confidence Building

*   **Gratitude House Exercise**: Before the listening tour and before interviews, individuals perform a "Gratitude House exercise" where they list all the people who have helped them in their life [01:15:20]. This helps remind them that they are not alone and fosters confidence by metaphorically bringing "50 people" with them into an interview [01:06:06, 01:06:43].
*   **Debriefing Interviews**: After interviews, it's crucial to debrief with the council or a trusted person to accurately interpret what happened and combat self-doubt or "impostor syndrome" [01:07:12, 01:07:46].
*   **Inner Critic Exercise**: Naming one's inner critic (e.g., "Tub Tour," "Gym") helps externalize and manage negative self-talk [01:07:54, 01:08:16].

## Long-Term Impact

The "Never Search Alone" method is designed to help job seekers not only find a job but also to avoid getting "stuck" in roles where they are not learning or growing [01:42:11]. By focusing on [[exploring_alternative_career_paths | career evolution]] and staying close to the "technology frontier," individuals can better navigate the dynamic nature of the job market (creative destruction) and ensure long-term career success [01:42:27, 01:43:36].

Phil Terry and his team also run product councils and CEO councils for people already in jobs, which are paid programs that helped develop the free Job Search Council methodology [01:15:18, 01:16:11]. They also offer an Associate Council program for individual contributors and new managers [01:32:37].

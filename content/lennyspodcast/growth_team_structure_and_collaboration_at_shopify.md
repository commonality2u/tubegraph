Shopify's approach to growth and team structure is unique, characterized by a long-term vision, distinct team objectives, and a strong emphasis on collaboration despite varied metric philosophies. Archie Abrams, VP of Product and Head of Growth at Shopify, oversees an organization of over 600 people across product, design, engineering, data operations, and growth marketing, embodying this distinctive strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Overall Company Philosophy

Shopify operates with a "hundred-year vision" set by CEO Toby, influencing all product priorities and roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Unlike many companies, core product teams at Shopify do not have metrics or KPIs; instead, decisions are based on taste, intuition, and alignment with this long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. [[shopifys_approach_to_growth_without_kpis | This approach allows for a focus on building the "right things" for the future, rather than short-term metric optimization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

### Three Major Product Groups
Shopify's product organization is structured into three main groups, each with different time horizons and approaches:
*   **Core Product** aims to build the fundamental elements for commerce 100 years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Merchant Services** focuses on developing tools like payments and shipping, with a shorter to medium-term outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Growth** concentrates on the entire customer journey, from acquisition to sustained success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## Growth Team Structure

The [[structuring_a_growth_team | growth team structure]] at Shopify is divided into two primary groups:
1.  **Growth R&D**: This encompasses traditional product teams including product, design, engineering, and data disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
2.  **Growth Marketing**: This group handles paid acquisition, media buying, affiliate marketing, email campaigns, content strategy, and SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

Within Growth R&D, there are three key pillars:
*   **Growth Products**: Responsible for the full merchant lifecycle, from landing pages, sign-up, and onboarding to monetization (trials, incentives) and engagement (e.g., the home feed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. The goal is to encourage continued entrepreneurship and business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.
*   **Enablement ("Ad Pillar")**: Builds internal tools for both the growth team and the broader Shopify organization. This includes the experimentation platform, communication platform, business intelligence tooling, and marketing technology (MarTech) to support the growth marketing team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.
*   **Customer Support Group**: Uniquely, the customer support function sits within growth. This strategic placement ensures that customer support is viewed as an integral part of the merchant's journey, from initial attempts at entrepreneurship to becoming a large business on Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. This team focuses on building tools and experiences for merchants to engage in self-serve support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.

## Metrics and Accountability

While core product teams shun KPIs, the growth team focuses on absolute numbers of merchants and their long-term Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This means:
*   **Total Cohort Value**: The primary high-level metric is the total GMV generated by a cohort of merchants over several years (e.g., three to five years), not per merchant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This power-law based metric aligns with Shopify's mission to enable widespread entrepreneurship, where a few highly successful merchants can offset many who do not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Absolute Numbers vs. Ratios**: Teams are incentivized to optimize for the *total number* of people who complete a step in the journey, rather than conversion rates. This prevents teams from artificially improving their conversion rates by making earlier funnel steps harder (e.g., making sign-up more difficult to only admit higher-intent users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Experimentation**: Shopify uses [[longterm_experimentation_and_decision_making_at_shopify | long-term holdouts for experiments]]. While experiments are called after three weeks, the assigned cohorts are continuously monitored for their GMV impact for months and even years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. This often reveals that short-term lifts do not translate to long-term impact (approximately 30-40% of experiments show no long-term lift despite initial positive signs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. Sometimes, a "neutral" short-term impact can lead to significant long-term gains by unlocking valuable new merchant segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

## Collaboration Between Teams

Collaboration between the growth team and other product groups, particularly core product, is crucial, despite their different operating philosophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.
*   **Intentional Tension**: The relationship is designed to be "almost at odds," creating a healthy tension that ensures both speed/optimization (growth) and quality/long-term vision (core) are maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.
*   **Trust and Quality**: The growth team emphasizes building trust by consistently delivering high-quality, polished features, even when moving quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.
*   **Unified Product Review**: Every six weeks, R&D group leads, including Toby (CEO) and Glenn (Head of Core Product), review every single project across the company. This ensures alignment on technical architecture, adherence to core principles, and serves as a forum for resolving disagreements on the "how" of building products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.
*   **"No Wizard" Principle**: A key example of this collaboration is the "no wizard" principle (avoiding simplified onboarding flows that don't reflect the actual product). Growth teams work with Core Product to integrate simplifying principles directly into the product experience, rather than creating separate "wizard" flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.

### Collaboration with Sales
As Shopify has expanded its sales efforts, particularly for larger businesses, the growth team has adapted its [[collaboration_between_product_and_sales_teams | collaboration between product and sales teams]]:
*   **Qualitative Insights**: Product decisions for larger customers, where quantitative data can be less scalable, are heavily informed by qualitative insights from sales and merchant success teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Journeys**: A major focus has been creating seamless "hybrid journeys" that allow merchants to fluidly transition between self-service and sales-assisted channels, rather than forcing a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. This requires significant re-instrumentation of metrics and attribution models to accurately value different touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>.

### Marketing Structure
Shopify does not have a single Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). Instead, marketing leads are embedded within various organizations:
*   Growth marketing sits within the growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
*   Revenue marketing is closer to sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
*   Brand marketing reports to the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.
*   Product marketing managers (PMMs) are embedded with product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.
*   Consumer-facing marketing for products like Shop is separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>.

This decentralized structure places marketers closer to the primary goals and relevant outcomes, allowing for faster execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. Its success is attributed to Toby and Harley's strong intuition for the brand, which provides a cohesive vision that a CMO would typically oversee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.

Company values are important, but their creation and application require careful thought to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.

## Pitfalls in Defining Company Values

It's common to mishandle the process of defining company values, leading to ineffective or even detrimental outcomes:
*   **Avoid copying values**: Simply taking values from other companies (e.g., Facebook, Amazon's "users first") and pasting them into your own organization is ineffective and can undermine confidence in leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.
*   **Avoid dishonesty**: Do not claim values that are not genuinely practiced or reflected in the company's decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>. For example, claiming "users first" but making decisions that contradict this value is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.
*   **Avoid "identity values"**: These are values that everyone would agree with, making them non-actionable and not useful for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. Examples include:
    *   "We build good software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>
    *   "We solve customer problems that matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>
    *   "We care about our customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>
    *   "We're kind to other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>
    *   "We're a family" (unless contrasted with an alternative like Netflix's "sports team" value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>
*   **Limit the number of values**: Companies often have too many values (e.g., 17); it's best to aim for around four that people can easily remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.

## Characteristics of Effective Company Values

Good values serve as practical guides for decision-making and reflect the true operational reality of the organization. Will Larson proposes three key components:

### 1. Honesty
Values must truthfully represent how the company operates and makes decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. For instance, a company can genuinely be "Thrifty" or choose to "spend as much as needed to get the best value"; both can be valid, but the stated value must align with actual behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>. A company should avoid stating values they aspire to, but don't actually embody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

### 2. Applicability
Values should be practical and provide guidance for employees in their daily work and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>.
*   **Stripe's "Optimize Globally"**: This value encouraged engineers to make decisions that benefited the entire organization, even if it meant sacrificing a local team's preference (e.g., introducing a new programming language better for a specific team but worse for the overall organization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.
*   **Uber's implicit value**: During a specific era, Uber implicitly valued "do what's good for your team and ignore everyone else." This allowed teams to move extremely fast, as they didn't worry about external coordination, leading to rapid expansion, such as setting up operations in China within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>.

### 3. Reversibility
Good values should have a clear opposite or alternative. This means that embracing one value necessarily implies *not* embracing its opposite, helping to differentiate the company and clarify choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>. Values like "integrity" or "caring about customers" lack reversibility because no company would realistically claim the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.

Ultimately, good values should help a company filter who fits and who doesn't, serving as a "hiring filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. If a value applies to everyone, it's not truly useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

> "If it doesn't apply to anyone you're hiring or anyone that you have in the company then it just sort of like isn't worth having because you already have too many values you already to get rid of values who you have like 17 you need to get down to like four where people can remember them so if it doesn't apply to anyone like why why bother having it at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>

By focusing on these three characteristics—honesty, applicability, and reversibility—companies can develop more meaningful and impactful values that truly guide their operations.

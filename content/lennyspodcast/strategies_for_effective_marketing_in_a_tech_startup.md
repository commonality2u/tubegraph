Ros Herberg, Chief Marketing Officer and VP of Product Strategy at Whiz, shares insights into effective marketing strategies for tech startups, drawn from her experience at Whiz, the world's fastest-growing software company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Her journey from engineering to product and then to marketing provides a unique perspective on scaling a company through strategic market engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Product-Market Fit and Early Customer Engagement

Whiz's initial phase was characterized by uncertainty. As the seventh employee and first product manager, Ros joined when the founders were still figuring out their core idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Six weeks after she joined, the company had to pivot because their initial concept wasn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Listening to Customer Signals
During their early days, Whiz conducted 10 to 15 meetings daily with potential customers, despite not having a solid product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Ros, as the product manager, found it confusing because she didn't understand what they were supposed to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Many customers would offer polite feedback like "sounds interesting," but no genuine enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

The pivotal moment came when Ros admitted she didn't understand what the company was doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This led to a deep discussion and a pivot to cloud security, a domain where the team had prior expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

When they hit the right idea, the customer conversations changed drastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Instead of polite interest, customers started asking:
*   "How are you pricing this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>
*   "When can we start doing a PO?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>
*   "I know exactly who I need to connect you to in my team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>

These were strong indications of genuine pull from the market, signifying that the new idea was working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Ros emphasizes that it's natural to have a bias towards affirmation, but it's crucial to listen for deep enthusiasm and concrete next steps from potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

### Founders in Sales
In the early days of Whiz, the founding team, including Ros, were themselves closing deals and handling contracts for a couple of million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This hands-on approach allowed them to learn invaluable lessons directly from the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Ros highlights that if the core team cannot sell the product, hiring someone from the outside to solve the problem is often wishful thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This early immersion in [[Sales strategies for startups]] provided a strong foundation before hiring dedicated sales teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Transitioning to Marketing and Brand Building

Ros's move from [[Product Management in Tech Companies]] to CMO was unconventional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. She was asked to lead marketing because, despite having product-market fit and a functional sales team, Whiz was losing potential customers because they hadn't heard of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Ros believes that understanding market dynamics and brand is essential for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### "Follow the Heat" in the Organization
Ros describes how the "heat" or primary focus shifts within a growing company:
*   **Early days**: [[Product Management in Tech Companies | product]] development and defining the offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Next**: Engineering to build the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Then**: [[Sales strategies for startups | sales]] as initial deals close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **Later**: Marketing becomes the focus to generate pipeline and awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

This perspective highlights the evolving [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_growth]] and where leadership attention is most needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### Differentiating Marketing from Product Development
Ros's product background informed her approach to marketing, noting a key difference:
*   **Product**: "Less is more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. Adding a feature incurs significant engineering cost and cannot be easily removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Mistakes have a "huge cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: "Quite the opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. There's "no cost to anything, no maintenance, no technical debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. If a marketing effort fails, you move on to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. This encourages experimentation.

### Innovative and Bold Branding
To create noise and stand out, Whiz embraced a counter-intuitive approach to its brand, especially in the cybersecurity industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>:
*   **RSA Conference**: Instead of a typical "red and black" cyber booth, Whiz created a "Whiz of Oz" themed booth with actors like Dorothy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This drastically increased foot traffic and engagement compared to the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   **Brand Aesthetic**: Ros moved Whiz's brand from dark colors to "pink, bright blue," and an "optimistic" focus on "magic" rather than scaring people about attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This [[Creative branding strategies for startups]] led to other cyber companies eventually adopting similar themed approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

### The "Dummy Explanation" and Clear Communication
Ros emphasizes the need for crystal-clear communication, especially as an organization scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. As product teams live in their "bubble" of deep technical knowledge, they can become remote from the common buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

Marketing bridges this gap, acting as a multiplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Ros advocates for the "dummy explanation" â€“ ensuring that every piece of communication from Whiz is understandable by anyone, without assuming deep knowledge of the product or market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. For example, instead of using technical jargon like "CNAPP" or "Whiz Graph Database," they prioritize simple, common terms like "Cloud Security Solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Building Trust and Embracing Vulnerability
CMO is a challenging role that requires deep trust with the founding team and a strong connection to the product and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Ros highlights that trust is easily broken if marketing messages don't align with the founders' vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

Ros also encourages embracing vulnerability, even in leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Her willingness to say "I don't understand" early on at Whiz was a critical moment for the company's pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This openness fosters a flat organizational culture where voices are heard regardless of seniority, leading to greater employee loyalty and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

### Being Okay with Failure
A core part of Ros's mindset is being "okay with being pretty sure I'm going to fail at something and still attempting it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. This "learned quality" allows her to take risks and explore unconventional paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. She advocates ignoring imposter syndrome and trying new things, as one "will never know your limit if you don't try" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. This approach directly contrasts with the risks of [[ineffective_growth_tactics_in_tech_startups | ineffective growth tactics]].

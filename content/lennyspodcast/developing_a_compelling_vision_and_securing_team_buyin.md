Mahika Kapor, a design engineering Product Manager (PM) hybrid at Figma, is renowned for her exceptional ability to [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | create a compelling vision]] and secure buy-in for new products [00:00:12]. Described as the "go-to person at Figma for leading new 0-to-1 products," she is beloved by her colleagues [00:00:55]. This article explores her approach to vision, conviction, communication, and building team enthusiasm.

## The Importance of Vision
Mahika believes that vision is "everything" [00:08:12]. A strong vision, shared by the PM, team, and company, provides an anchor during the chaotic and messy product development cycle [00:08:18]. It ensures that setbacks, such as user feedback leading to a pivot, are perceived as learning opportunities rather than discouraging moments, allowing every step to feel like forward progress towards a defined future [0008:46].

## Crafting a Compelling Vision
[[developing_and_communicating_a_product_vision | Crafting a compelling vision]] requires deep engagement and cross-functional collaboration [00:09:15]:
*   **User and Team Inseparability**
    *   A compelling vision cannot emerge in a vacuum [00:09:22]. It requires being "fundamentally inseparable" from both users and the team [00:09:30].
*   **Cross-Pollination of Functions**
    *   Integrate research insights to understand user emotions [00:09:50].
    *   Utilize beautiful designs and prototypes to communicate future possibilities [00:10:00].
    *   Root the vision in engineering and feasibility, ensuring what is being pursued is achievable [00:10:06].
    *   Avoid a linear process where research, design, and engineering insights are siloed; instead, encourage [[building_effective_product_teams | cross-pollination of ideas and people working together]] [00:10:33].

**Example: FigJam's Democratic Workplace Vision** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>
Mahika's work on FigJam was inspired by whiteboarding's surge during the pandemic, addressing the need to pull remote teammates into a common space [00:12:37]. The vision centered on enhancing the meetings experience, aiming for a world where people are brought together into a shared space [00:13:12].

An early insight was identifying brainstorms as the most common and effective meeting type in FigJam [00:13:26]. Brainstorms are a "democratizing process" where ideas come from anywhere, not just the loudest person [00:14:27]. Recognizing a gap between Figma's internal "on steroids" usage of FigJam for everything (product reviews, Gantt charts, bug bashes) and external users primarily using it for brainstorms, the team sought to understand what made brainstorms uniquely successful [00:14:02]. This led to the vision of making the "generative nature of a brainstorm" the norm for all meetings [00:15:20]. Features like music and voting were launched to foster this flow and make any meeting more democratic [00:16:13]. The core idea was to make the product feel like it was "built for me" and make users feel special [00:41:25].

## Communicating and Getting Buy-in for Vision
At Figma, where the culture is "very detail-oriented" and practices "the future being visual communication," words alone are insufficient [00:11:12].
*   **Visual Communication**: Lean "heavily into designing and prototyping even before a project gets a green light" [00:17:58]. This "see to believe" approach fosters an emotional pull towards investment [00:18:17].
*   **Pitch Structure**: A compelling vision pitch is structured as "pain point, solution, proof point" [00:11:51]. Proof points can be user testimonials or data [00:12:06].
*   **Unified Artifact**: The team should create a "single artifact" for the vision, such as decks made in Figma, to ensure collective ownership and passion [00:17:13].
*   **Leveraging Hackathons**: Hackathons (like Figma's internal "maker week") are not just for engineers [00:20:46]. Anyone with an idea can use them to pitch, build momentum, and recruit collaborators [00:20:58]. Mahika herself built conviction for her current product months before a hackathon, then used the event to rally a team [00:20:31].
*   **Ask for Help**: Don't let a lack of design or engineering skills stop you [00:18:46]. "Go around and ask people" for help; someone will likely say yes, helping build momentum [00:21:22]. AI tools are also lowering the barrier to building prototypes [00:19:55].

## Building Strong Conviction
Strong conviction is key to navigating the "messy journey from zero to one" and rallying the team [00:22:05].
*   **Create Momentum**: A PM's primary role is to "constantly be creating forward progress" [00:23:35].
*   **Embrace "Two-Way Doors"**: Most decisions in software are reversible ("two-way doors") [00:22:52]. This reduces the pressure of needing to be perfectly right from the start.
*   **Intuition from User Immersion**: Product sense, or good intuition, is built through "insatiable curiosity and talking to users at every chance you get" [00:23:38]. Regularly having conversations with users creates a "repository or library of conversations" that informs product decisions [00:24:08].
*   **Proposing "A-Minus Ideas"**: Instead of starting from scratch, "putting out an idea even if it's totally wrong is a much better catalyst for getting to a good solution" [00:25:15]. People are more likely to react to an idea than to nothing [00:25:25]. Aim to go into user research with at least an "A-minus idea" to refine it [00:25:50].
*   **"Strong Opinions, Weakly Held"**: While having strong conviction, it's crucial to be willing to "kill your darlings" if external signals, especially from users, suggest a different direction [00:26:20]. Agility is vital [00:26:32].

## Balancing Strong Opinions with Team Collaboration
Mahika acknowledges that strong conviction can have downsides, potentially leading to skepticism if not managed well [00:27:09].
*   **Explicit Confidence Levels**: Clearly communicate confidence levels (e.g., "I feel medium confidence on it, so if you feel stronger, I defer to you") [00:27:57].
*   **Two-Way Direct Communication**: Mahika prefers a "very direct communication style" and ensures it's a two-way street [00:28:28]. She explicitly tells new team members, "if you disagree with me, I want to know that" [00:28:51]. This prevents team members from holding back due to a perceived strong opinion [00:29:18].
*   **"Feedback as a Gift"**: Embrace feedback as a continuous process, not just during formal cycles [00:30:39]. To encourage this, offer feedback first (e.g., "Do you have feedback for me?") and act on it quickly to incentivize others to do the same [00:31:07].

## Building Hype
[[creating_an_entrepreneurial_culture_within_an_organization | Building hype]] is essential for a product to succeed, especially for bottom-up, zero-to-one ideas [00:33:00].
*   **Personal Responsibility**: As the spearhead of a product, it's on you to "have a pulse on how everyone else is feeling" and "constantly [prop] up" the project [00:33:37].
*   **Leverage Large Forums**: Utilize major company events like sales kickoffs (SKOs), hackathons ([[creating_an_entrepreneurial_culture_within_an_organization | maker weeks]]), and annual showcases (Config) to demonstrate the product and generate excitement [00:36:03]. An unexpected demo can generate significant hype by allowing people to "see what you yourself see in the future" [00:36:22].
*   **Genuine Belief**: Hype cannot be faked; it comes from genuinely believing in the product and helping others see your vision [00:36:41].
*   **Strategic Visibility**: Push for product visibility "even beyond what the current stage of product development merits" [00:37:18]. This generates valuable signal on product direction and adds "fuel to the fire" for the team [00:37:29].
*   **Emotional Connection**: Drive external hype by creating emotional connections with users, making them feel the product was "built for me" [00:41:14]. Understand your product's unique "brand of delight or excitement or energy" (e.g., FigJam's cheeky personality vs. Figma's niche design capabilities) [00:41:42]. For FigJam's anniversary, they created a "birthday party" with in-product Easter eggs for users [00:40:33].

## User Immersion for Vision and Conviction
Continuous immersion in the user base is critical for forming strong convictions and painting a grand vision [00:42:26].
*   **Constant Conversations**: "Constantly immersing yourself in those circles where your users are" is paramount [00:43:45]. This includes casually asking friends in tech or tech-adjacent fields about product usage [00:43:51].
*   **Ask Non-Users**: Crucially, ask non-users why they *don't* use your product [00:44:38]. These are often the "most insightful conversations" as they reveal gaps in marketing, perception, or core functionality [00:44:43].
*   **Operationalizing Insights**:
    *   **Sales Team Cadence**: Establish a "recurring cadence with the folks in our sales team" to understand customer pain points and share upcoming product features [00:48:22].
    *   **Artifacts for Evangelization**: Create artifacts like Loom videos demonstrating internal product usage, which sales teams can distribute to customers to inspire broader use cases [00:48:56].
    *   **Feedback Backlog**: For insights not immediately actionable, store them in a backlog (e.g., using a Slack-Asana integration) for weekly grooming and prioritization [00:49:48].

## Deep Care and Passion
Mahika emphasizes that her deep care for the product inspires the same in her colleagues [00:51:47].
*   **Assumptions Drive Strategy**: Disagreements in product strategy often stem from differing underlying assumptions [00:52:46]. For top-down strategies, understand the leadership's assumptions; for bottom-up pushes, ensure everyone shares your assumptions [00:53:26].
*   **Authentic Passion**: The more you believe in an idea, the more natural it is to be passionate about it [00:53:55].
*   **Finding Your Passion**: If not passionate about the current project, broaden your perspective [00:54:28]:
    *   Consider your "scope as the world" rather than just the current in-flight project [00:55:01].
    *   Explore if your passionate idea falls within or outside your current company, guiding your career next steps [00:55:05].
    *   Anyone can "found something," either within an existing company (leveraging distribution, technical advantages, or lower risk) or from scratch [00:55:27]. This choice depends on risk tolerance and the nature of building the team and pitching [00:56:06].

## Building New Things at Larger Companies (Zero to One)
Mahika is Figma's go-to person for zero-to-one initiatives, which she views as critical for a company's sustained competitiveness and [[longterm_vision_and_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurial]] spirit [01:16:13].
*   **Staying Entrepreneurial**: Companies must "constantly [think] about what's next," defining industry standards and anticipating competitors [01:16:41].
*   **"Run With It" Culture**: Figma's "run with it" core value encourages individuals to "sprint off in a direction" [01:17:04]. This is seen as a manifestation of company values, not a distraction [01:17:17].
*   **Hackathon Origins**: Many of Figma's monumental launches (e.g., multi-edit, Jambot AI plugin, widgets platform) originated as hackathon projects, demonstrating a culture that celebrates bottom-up innovation [01:17:24].

**Bringing an Idea into Existence (The "Flame" Metaphor)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>
Mahika views the person pushing a zero-to-one idea as the "Keeper of the Flame," tasked with stoking the embers when they risk dying and ensuring the idea spreads like wildfire [01:19:11].
1.  **Have the Right Idea**: This comes from "user empathy" – constantly conversing with users about pain points, product perceptions, and their end-to-end tool usage [01:21:18]. The idea must also "ladder[] into a company goal," such as Figma's goal to expand beyond designers to cover the entire product development cycle [01:21:50].
2.  **Secure Buy-in**: This involves the "vision piece" – rallying leadership and the team behind the idea [01:23:00]. It often requires "optimism that borders on delusion," translating "no" into "not yet" [01:23:14]. Be willing to be "scrappy" and make minor changes (e.g., swapping an icon) to make a new product "feel more real" even if not fully built [01:25:28].
3.  **Make it Spread**: Once pitched, leverage company-wide forums to get teammates, colleagues, and peers to evangelize the idea, creating powerful momentum [01:26:30]. Figma's multi-month "staging" or "dogfooding" process is key to this [01:27:10]. Getting early internal feedback allows the product to mature and makes people feel "invested" because they "shaped that part of the product" [01:28:14]. This [[building_effective_product_teams | elevates the quality of the product]] and fosters a collaborative "team sport" mentality [01:28:54].

### Key Takeaways for Zero-to-One Success:
*   **Shout Your Insights**: If you have a unique insight, "shout from the rooftops about all the insights that you're learning" to foster an [[creating_an_entrepreneurial_culture_within_an_organization | entrepreneurial culture]] [01:29:33].
*   **Understand Motivations**: Cater to individual team members' motivations rather than treating everyone the same [01:30:09]. Some engineers prefer solutions handed to them, while others want to be deeply involved in product visioning [01:30:32]. Directly ask team members about their desired involvement [01:31:21]. Take decisions "in the open" to provide opportunities for input and pushback [01:31:47].

In B2B environments, sales is fundamentally about solving problems, not merely selling commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. For this reason, the [[the_role_of_product_managers | product team]], especially its leadership, plays a crucial and increasingly active role in the sales process and overall business growth.

## Founder's Involvement in Early Sales
Founders, often with deep product knowledge, are inherently good at the "middle part" of sales conversationsâ€”explaining the product and market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. They can articulate how the product works, how it eliminates issues, and how it solves specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Customers often prefer to speak directly with the CEO in the early stages, as it's a "magical" experience for early adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Founders should dedicate about 20% of their time to sales efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

## Product Expertise in the Sales Team
Early sales hires must be "product gurus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. Sales representatives, particularly in the initial stages of a SaaS business, need to deeply understand the product to identify and solve customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Interview processes for sales roles should involve a "sell me this product" exercise to assess their ability to explain and demonstrate the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. They should at least have watched explainer videos and understood the product as well as a public webinar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

In growing companies, the [[the_role_of_product_advocates_in_scaling_and_sales | Head of Product]] should be deeply involved in sales, especially for large deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. They act as "mini CEOs" in these meetings, possessing the gravitas to make commitments on the roadmap and pivot discussions to secure deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. This deep product knowledge and authority can be a significant strategic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.

## Managing Feature Requests and Roadmap Influence
The relationship between sales and product teams can be a source of tension, which is actually a sign of a well-run B2B company engaged in enough deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. To manage feature requests from sales effectively:
*   **Allocate a Budget:** Give the sales team a quarterly budget for development, perhaps 10% of story points or similar metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>.
*   **Prioritize and Force Rank:** Sales leaders should be forced to prioritize and force-rank their requests based on this budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>.
*   **Clear Communication:** Product leaders need to be objective, not emotional, in these discussions, outlining costs and consequences of changing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>.
*   **Push Decisions Up:** Junior product managers should push decisions about major roadmap changes up to the VP level to avoid widespread disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>.
*   **Weekly Meetings:** The VP of Sales and VP of Product should hold weekly meetings to discuss product priorities and the allocation of the feature budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>.

## Product Team's Accountability and Customer Advocacy
While there's a trend of [[the_role_of_product_managers | product managers]] taking on P&L responsibilities or revenue goals, it's advised to be cautious of "weaponizing" functions solely for revenue targets, as it can damage customer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>.

Instead, the product team should be the "voice of the customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>. This includes:
*   **Relentlessly Reducing Churn:** Especially for [[emergence_and_impact_of_productled_sales | product-led growth]] (PLG) models, product teams should focus on relentlessly bringing down churn, as revenue compounds over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:02">[01:27:02]</a>.
*   **Earning Price Increases:** If prices are raised, the product should demonstrably offer more value to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>.
*   **Advocating for Free/Freemium:** Product teams should champion free or freemium models, as they improve the entire product (even for paid customers) by forcing better onboarding and reducing reliance on human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:44">[01:37:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>. The "VP of free" (often the CEO or head of product) is crucial to nurture the large base of non-converting users who are still advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:18">[01:32:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>.

Ultimately, product teams should aim to "make customers happier," as this is where the delight in product work lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. By shipping "three great things" in a year, product teams can inspire the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:13">[01:41:13]</a>.

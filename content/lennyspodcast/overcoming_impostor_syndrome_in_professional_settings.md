[[overcoming_impostor_syndrome_in_professional_settings | Impostor syndrome]] is a common feeling in professional environments, where individuals believe they don't truly deserve their position or that they were an "admissions mistake" or "hiring mistake" [02:21:55]. This mindset can lead to [[overcoming_limiting_beliefs | self-sabotage]] and hinder career progression, as it prevents individuals from doing what is necessary to be successful in their career [00:49:51].

## Get Out of Your Own Way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:46">[02:14:46]</a>

One of the fundamental principles for growing power and advancing in one's career is to [[overcoming_limiting_beliefs | get out of your own way]] [02:14:46]. When a topic makes people uncomfortable, they tend to shy away from it [02:28:30]. Similarly, if one views power as "dirty" or "evil," they will not take the necessary steps to succeed professionally [02:47:07]. This principle is directly tied to addressing [[overcoming_impostor_syndrome_in_professional_settings | impostor syndrome]] [02:21:20].

### Recognizing and Addressing Impostor Syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:55">[02:19:55]</a>

Many individuals suffer from [[overcoming_impostor_syndrome_in_professional_settings | impostor syndrome]], believing they don't truly deserve their job because they are surrounded by seemingly smarter and better people [02:21:55]. This attitude can manifest in self-defeating behaviors:

*   **Preemptive Apologies**: Some individuals apologize before even speaking, stating things like, "I don't know if this comment is going to be useful" [02:22:17]. The advice is direct: if a comment isn't useful, don't say it, and stop all apologies [02:27:07].
*   **Undermining Self-Worth**: Using self-descriptors that disempower oneself is detrimental [02:30:01]. If you have been hired for a job, you are likely qualified, if not overqualified [02:29:52]. This negative self-perception can leak out and influence how others perceive you [02:30:09].
*   **Seeking Likability**: Prioritizing being liked over competence and respect can cap one's power [02:55:56]. A key takeaway is: "If you want to be liked, get a dog" [02:30:00]. While not actively trying to be disliked, the focus should be on getting the job done and achieving results [02:59:59].

### Acknowledge Others' Capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:47">[02:45:47]</a>

A helpful perspective in overcoming [[overcoming_impostor_syndrome_in_professional_settings | impostor syndrome]] is to "acknowledge that others are often no better than you" [02:45:47]. This can help alleviate feelings of inadequacy [02:49:15]. The goal is to prioritize competence and respect in professional settings [02:59:59].

### The Role of Coaching and Support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:27">[02:18:27]</a>

To overcome discomfort and develop these skills, seeking help and social support is crucial [02:18:27]. It is recommended to:
*   **Get a coach**: Professional coaches can provide guidance and help in applying the principles of power [02:18:27].
*   **Form a personal board of directors**: This involves assembling a group of people who can offer advice, social support, and accountability [02:18:27].

Just as one cannot learn tennis by reading or watching videos, one must practice and gain experience to develop these skills [02:47:07]. Starting with small, manageable steps and gradually pushing oneself out of the comfort zone is key to progress [02:53:51]. This iterative approach ensures gradual and sustainable growth [02:53:51].

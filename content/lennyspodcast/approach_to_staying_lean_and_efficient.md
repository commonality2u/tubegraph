Ivan Zhao, co-founder and CEO of Notion, emphasizes a deeply rooted philosophy of [[innovating_and_avoiding_process_overdependence | staying lean and craft and making trade-offs]] and efficiency that has guided the company since its inception. This approach contrasts with the prevailing tech trend of rapid, large-scale expansion, prioritizing sustainable growth, profitability, and a focused team [00:30:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

## Formative Experiences: The "Lost Years" Influence
The first three to four years of Notion, described by Zhao as the "Lost Years," were a period of intense struggle and recalibration [00:11:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This era significantly shaped the company's lean operational style:
*   **Early Product Misalignment** The initial version of Notion was conceived as an easy-to-use developer tool, reflecting Zhao's personal vision rather than market demand [00:11:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Most people, focused on getting their jobs done, didn't care about creating software to optimize their work [00:12:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Pivoting to Productivity** It took over two years to realize the need to "hide" their vision (enabling everyone to create software) within a more widely desired format: a productivity tool [00:12:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This was likened to hiding "broccoli" (the vision) inside "sugar" (the productivity tool) [00:13:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Technical Rebuilds** Notion rebuilt its codebase multiple times due to choosing unstable foundational technologies (like Google's Web Components before React became dominant) [00:14:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This necessitated laying off all but two co-founders and restarting the entire build [00:14:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, [00:17:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>).
*   **Personal Sacrifice** Zhao's mother helped kickstart the company and even loaned money during a critical period to bridge funding gaps [00:15:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, [00:15:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>).
*   **Resetting and Persistence** A key element was the courage to reset, even going as far as temporarily relocating to Japan to code daily and change their scenario [00:17:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, [00:17:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>). The belief that the desired product needed to exist, despite its non-existence, fueled their persistence [00:15:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

> [!tip] Advice for Founders Struggling with Product Market Fit
> *   **Believe in the Vision:** You need to deeply believe that what you're building needs to exist in the world [00:19:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
> *   **Stay Lean:** Be comfortable letting go of team members and operating with a minimal core [00:19:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
> *   **Disconnect & Reset:** Change your environment to gain new perspective and reset your mindset [00:19:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Get enough sleep to reset [00:22:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.
> *   **Courage to Reset:** Don't be afraid to throw away past work and start again, as progress through better abstractions can lead to faster compounding and recovery of sunk costs [00:22:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>, [00:23:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
> *   **Balance Vision and Market Needs:** Find a balance between building something authentic to yourself and something useful that the market wants [00:21:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>, [00:22:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Avoid becoming an "art project" (no users) or a "commodity" (too business-focused without unique value) [00:21:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
> *   **Beware of Momentum:** Don't let momentum carry you in a wrong direction; be willing to rethink and restart [00:24:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

## Core Principles of Lean Operation
Notion's lean approach is rooted in several key principles:

### Prioritizing Systems Over Headcount
*   **Multi-skilled Founders:** The co-founders possessed diverse skill sets, allowing them to manage many functions (coding, design, marketing, sales) with a very small team [00:30:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.
*   **Minimizing Overhead:** A smaller team reduces internal communication overhead and makes it easier to align everyone's vision [00:31:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Internal Tools:** Notion uses its own product as a "meta tool" to run the company, automating processes and reducing the need for more people [00:31:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. This inherently keeps costs low and fosters profitability [00:31:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
*   **Abstraction and System Thinking:** Zhao believes that "better system is much better than progress through people" [00:33:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Progress can be achieved faster through improved abstractions that compound quickly, rather than merely adding more human resources [00:23:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

### Focus on Talent Density
*   Notion consciously tracks "Talent density" and "Revenue per employee" rather than just the number of people [00:32:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.
*   This approach attracts more talented individuals, creating a positive compounding effect [00:32:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

### The "Small Bus" Metaphor
*   Internally, Notion uses the metaphor of a "small bus": a smaller bus is easier to turn, accelerate, and maneuver [00:33:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
*   The leader's role is to choose the "seatmates" on the bus, as their quality dictates the overall speed and experience of the company [00:33:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. This metaphor helps optimize for a lean and efficient team structure [00:34:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

## Practical Manifestations of Lean Principles
The commitment to lean operations and a focus on quality extends beyond team size:
*   **Financial Prudence:** Notion became profitable early and has retained most of the money it raised [00:30:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>, [00:30:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. This financial stability allows them to focus on building without constant pressure to raise more funds [00:31:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.
*   **Delayed Hiring of Specialized Roles:** Notion did not hire a salesperson until it hit over $10 million in ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) [00:32:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a> and its first Product Manager until the team reached about 50 people [00:30:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. This indicates a preference for organic growth and maximizing the output of a small, generalist team.
*   **Intentional Office Environment:** The office design reflects a thoughtful approach to well-being and creativity, prioritizing a cozy, home-like atmosphere to foster comfort and creative flow [00:35:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>, [00:35:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>. This emphasis on aesthetic value is seen as a way to avoid "hurting the eyes" and thus preventing negative input [00:35:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.
*   **Craftsmanship and Values:** Notion's internal philosophy of "craft and values" emphasizes applying skill and taste to technical know-how to make clever tradeoffs and create new, useful things [00:37:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. This pursuit of craftsmanship, akin to building a wood cabinet, leads to a durable and fulfilling energy source [00:38:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>, [00:21:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

## Navigating Trade-offs and the Market
The approach to staying lean and efficient also involves understanding and making strategic trade-offs [00:39:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Market:** The market is dynamic, constantly changing its "optimized function," especially with new technologies like AI language models, which are seen as new "materials" for creation [00:39:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>, [00:39:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   **Human Behavior as a Constraint:** Product makers must balance technological trade-offs with relatively stable human behavior, recognizing that people are resistant to learning new things after a certain age [00:40:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>, [00:40:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.
*   **Bundling vs. Unbundling:** Business operates in cycles of bundling and unbundling, as seen from early PC applications to modern SaaS [01:00:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. Notion's current position leverages bundling to create value, especially with AI, but acknowledges the market can shift [01:02:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>, [01:02:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.

Ultimately, a product maker's job is to find the "sweet spot" across these dimensions to create something with "a right to exist" and be durable [00:41:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.

Many people consider segmentation a well-understood concept, similar to product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. However, when companies are asked about their segmentation strategy, roughly 60% claim to have one, but only about 10% actually possess a meaningful strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>.

Most often, segmentation is mistakenly viewed as a demographic or persona-based exercise, focusing on how to position a product to different personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. This approach is frequently incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

## Core Concept of Segmentation

Effective segmentation must be based on what customers need, what they value, and what they are [[willingness_to_pay_conversations_in_product_pricing | willing to pay for]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. The key lesson is that companies need to be able to productize to different segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. If a company attempts to build one product and then position it to different segments, it has already lost the battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>.

Segmentation is about understanding heterogeneous needs in the market, how [[willingness_to_pay_conversations_in_product_pricing | willingness to pay]] differs across these needs, and then customizing products for those specific segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Building a single product and hoping it will appeal to everyone often results in attracting no one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.

### "You Can Act Differently" Framework

A true segmentation strategy is one where "you can act differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>. This means:
*   **You:** Your product teams, sales teams, marketing teams, and finance teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.
*   **Act:** Developing new products, building business cases, creating product marketing messages, and devising sales strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.
*   **Differently:** There is no point in segmentation if the response or treatment for everyone remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. If a company understands a customer's needs, value, and [[willingness_to_pay_conversations_in_product_pricing | willingness to pay]], their conversation and product offering should be tailored specifically for that customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.

## When to Consider Segmentation

Early-stage founders often believe they don't have time to build multiple products and should focus on a "one-size-fits-all" approach, revisiting segmentation later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. However, this is flawed thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

It is crucial to consider segmentation from the very beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. During early [[willingness_to_pay_conversations_in_product_pricing | willingness to pay conversations]] about a product idea, founders should identify:
*   Who is [[willingness_to_pay_conversations_in_product_pricing | willing to pay]] for this innovation? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>
*   What do they need? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>
*   How many of them are there? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>

This early understanding allows for the prioritization of the R&D roadmap and resource allocation to target the most relevant segment first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. Subsequent segments can be addressed later, ensuring value messaging is tailored, and the product is launched effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.

## Examples of Effective Segmentation

*   **Water Example:** Water, a single product, is priced differently based on differing needs: free from a fountain, $2 in a bottle, $2.50 with gas, and $5 from a mini-bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. This illustrates how the same product is [[unique_pricing_and_product_adoption_strategies | packaged]] and productized differently to meet varied customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
*   **Apple:** Instead of a single iPhone, Apple offers models at various price points (e.g., $299 to $1499), building products for different segments based on features and [[willingness_to_pay_conversations_in_product_pricing | willingness to pay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>.
*   **Eventbrite:** Before its IPO, Eventbrite had one product for all customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. After a segmentation exercise, they introduced three plans tailored to different needs, such as an entry-level plan with one ticket type for casual events and higher-tier plans with unlimited ticket types for professional events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.
*   **Uber:** Uber's various car types (Uber Black, UberX, Uber Pool, Comfort) are a prime example of segmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>. They offer different levels of service and features that appeal to different customer needs and [[willingness_to_pay_conversations_in_product_pricing | willingness to pay]] at different points in time or situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. The focus is increasingly on dynamic segmentation, understanding how customers switch segments based on evolving needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.

## Segmentation and Packaging/Bundling

[[unique_pricing_and_product_adoption_strategies | Packaging]] and bundling are crucial for unlocking segmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This involves configuring a product based on customer needs, value, and [[willingness_to_pay_conversations_in_product_pricing | willingness to pay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.

The "Leaders, Fillers, and Killers" framework helps in thinking about [[unique_pricing_and_product_adoption_strategies | packaging]] and bundling:
*   **Leaders:** Core products or features that over 50% of customers want, often "must-have" or "table stakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. In a McDonald's Happy Meal, the Big Mac is the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.
*   **Fillers:** Features or products that, when added to a bundle, marginally increase price while significantly increasing sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. In a Happy Meal, french fries and coke are fillers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>. These are often "nice-to-have" features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>.
*   **Killers:** Items that, if included in a bundle, would significantly depreciate the [[willingness_to_pay_conversations_in_product_pricing | willingness to pay]] across the entire customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>. These are features that people don't need or aren't [[willingness_to_pay_conversations_in_product_pricing | willing to pay]] for, and would "kill" the deal if included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>. They are best offered as add-ons to a small segment of customers who specifically want them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.

Identifying leaders, fillers, and killers comes from [[willingness_to_pay_conversations_in_product_pricing | willingness to pay conversations]], specifically through exercises where customers prioritize features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.

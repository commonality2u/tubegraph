Competitive public speaking, particularly at an elite level, presents unique demands and opportunities for personal growth. Tristan de Saint Michel, co-creator of Ultra Speaking, notably became the fastest competitor to reach the finals of the World Championship of Public Speaking in 2017 [00:00:45]. His journey through this intense competition informed the development of his unique course, aimed at helping individuals quickly build skills and become more comfortable [[strategies_for_spontaneous_speaking | speaking on the spot]] [00:00:51].

## The Transformative Nature of the Journey
Improving public speaking is considered a "meta skill," similar to fitness, where breakthroughs in speaking can positively impact various aspects of one's life, including work, friendships, and family relationships [00:06:06]. This [[transformative_nature_of_improving_public_speaking_skills | transformative nature of improving public speaking skills]] is a key aspect of competitive public speaking, as the personal growth extends beyond the stage [00:07:02]. The core belief is that everyone possesses the "hardware" for effective communication, and the challenge lies in "debugging" and "upgrading the software" that may have developed "bugs" over time [00:08:10].

## High-Stakes Preparation and Performance
Competitive public speaking demands rigorous preparation. For the World Championship semifinals, competitors must have two speeches ready: one for the semifinals and a completely new one for the finals [01:50:01]. Both speeches are expected to be "world class" [01:50:16].

One significant challenge is managing nerves and [[techniques_to_manage_public_speaking_anxiety | anxiety]]. Tristan experienced this personally six days before his semifinal competition. Despite believing he had a compelling speech that brought him to tears during writing due to its personal connection and the pressure, a practice run before 50 people revealed audience disengagement [01:50:59]. He observed audience members checking agendas or phones during what he thought was the most impactful part of his speech [01:51:20].

This experience led to "waves of anxiety" [01:52:07]. He realized the speech was "terrible" and made the decision to discard it entirely, rebuilding a completely new speech from the ground up in just five days [01:51:50]. This new speech was a compilation of his best explorations and experiments over the preceding three months, incorporating effective jokes and smooth transitions [01:52:21].

## Overcoming Performance Obstacles
To prepare for the pressure of the competition, Tristan would practice his speech out loud in public spaces, such as a plaza in Vancouver, simulating the stage size to get over nerves and ensure he could remember his content [01:52:45]. A pivotal moment occurred when he delivered this new speech to one person, a district director, who was moved to tears, confirming its impact [01:53:02]. This validated his effort and preparation, leading him to win the semifinals [01:53:27].

The intensive nature of the competition, which involved giving over 100 speeches in seven months and filming every single one for feedback, highlights the importance of consistent practice and rapid iteration [01:50:42]. This journey reinforced the idea that public speaking is a "high performance skill" [01:04:43] and that [[practical_advice_for_reducing_nerves_in_public_speaking | outworking others]] was key to his success [01:49:26].

## Learning from "Turbulence"
The approach to mastering public speaking, particularly for competitive scenarios, involves deliberately creating "turbulence" through [[public_speaking_exercises_and_games | games and exercises]] [01:42:09]. These exercises are designed to expose areas where a speaker struggles, such as resisting the urge to "leak" insecurities or failing to "end strong" [01:42:50]. The goal is not perfection, but rather to highlight areas for improvement so that the speaker can learn to "recover gracefully from their mistakes," a hallmark of true professionals [01:43:30]. This continuous feedback loop helps in "upgrading the software" of speaking, making individuals more resilient and confident in any speaking scenario, especially spontaneous ones [01:44:06].

Competitive public speaking, therefore, is not just about winning, but about a profound journey of self-discovery and skill mastery that translates to immense benefits in all areas of life [01:44:11].

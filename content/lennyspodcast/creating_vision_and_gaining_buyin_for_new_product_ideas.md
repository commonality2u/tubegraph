From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 
Mahika Kapor, a design engineering PM hybrid at Figma, is renowned for her ability to [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | create compelling product visions]] and secure buy-in for new product ideas, particularly in the realm of [[developing_longterm_strategic_approaches_in_product_development | leading new zero-to-one products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. She was an early PM on FigJam and is currently spearheading the development of a new product set to launch in June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## The Importance of Vision

Mahika believes that [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | vision is everything]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. A strong [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | vision]], supported by the team and company, is crucial because the [[developing_longterm_strategic_approaches_in_product_development | product development]] cycle is often messy and chaotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. It serves as an anchor, ensuring that even pivots due to user feedback are perceived as forward progress and learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The fundamental question is: "If you and your team do your job correctly, what does the world look like?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>

## Crafting a Compelling Vision

A compelling [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | vision]] cannot be created in a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Key aspects include:

*   **Inseparability from Users and Team**
    *   It requires fundamental connection with users and the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
    *   [[Developing a Product Vision Framework | Cross-pollination of functions]] (research, design, engineering) is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Research provides user empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, designs and prototypes communicate the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, and feasibility needs to be considered by engineering early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This collaborative approach leads to a stronger [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | vision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

*   **Visual Communication and Storytelling**
    *   At Figma, "words will only get you so far" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The culture is highly detail-oriented and emphasizes visual communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
    *   A [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | vision]] pitch should integrate pain points, solutions, and proof points (like user testimonials or data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   The aim is to create a *single artifact* together as a team, fostering ownership and passion, rather than relying on linear readouts from individual functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This often means creating presentations directly in Figma, leveraging designs and prototypes even before a project gets a green light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
    *   **Example: FigJam's "Democratic Meetings" Vision** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>
        *   **Insight**: Brainstorms were highly effective in FigJam because they democratized participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. In contrast, many meetings are one-way (e.g., one person talking, others reacting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
        *   **Vision**: Create a world where the generative nature of a brainstorm becomes the norm for all types of meetings, fostering a more democratic workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
        *   **Proof points/Rituals**: Encouraging sticky notes in kickoffs, "Kudos boards" for team appreciation, and features like music and voting to enhance flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## Developing Conviction

Mahika's ability to develop "extremely strong conviction extremely quickly" allows her to navigate the messy journey of zero-to-one [[product development]] and rally her team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

*   **Creating Momentum**: A PM's key role is to constantly create forward progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Most decisions in a software company are "two-way doors" (reversible), making it important to have an opinion to anchor people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
*   **Building [[product_management_insights_and_extreme_clarity | Product Sense]] (Intuition)**: This is built through insatiable curiosity and constant conversations with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. These anecdotes create a "repository or library" of insights for product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
*   **Putting Ideas Out There**: Even if an idea is "totally wrong," putting it out is a better catalyst for a good solution because people react to something, not nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. It's better to start with an "A-minus idea" before user research to refine it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
*   **Strong Opinions, Weakly Held**: While conviction is key, it's equally important to be willing to "kill your darlings" if external signals or feedback tell you otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. Agility to pivot is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.
*   **Direct Communication**: Being direct about the level of confidence in an opinion (e.g., "medium confidence") helps team members feel comfortable disagreeing and speaking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. This fosters a culture where everyone feels comfortable giving their opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. Feedback should be a constant, two-way flow, rather than an annual event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

## Gaining Buy-in / Building Hype

Building hype is essential, whether it's pushing a top-down initiative or a bottom-up idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

*   **PM's Responsibility**: It's on the PM to have a pulse on how everyone feels about the product and to constantly keep it "propped up" and exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Large Forums**: Internal events like Maker Week (internal hackathon), Sales Kickoff (SKO), and Config (annual showcase) are critical for demonstrating and getting everyone to "see what you're seeing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
    *   **Example: Demoing an Unfinished Product at SKO**: Mahika insisted on including a demo of her still-rough, buggy new product at the company's Sales Kickoff, the first company-wide forum of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. This unexpected demo generated significant hype and provided valuable product insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.
*   **Hype and Emotion**: Hype is deeply tied to emotion. Products should be built to make users "feel special" and happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. Hype varies by product; for FigJam, it's about its "cheeky," friendly personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
    *   **Example: FigJam's Birthday Party**: For FigJam's one-year anniversary, features were "Easter egged" throughout the product, and users were sent on an Easter egg hunt for presents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.

## Immersion in User Base ([[developing_user_empathy_and_gathering_insights_for_product_development | User Empathy]])

Deep immersion in the user base is fundamental for generating insights and painting a grand [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | vision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

*   **Constant User Conversations**: This means not just talking to current users, but critically, to *non-users* to understand why they aren't using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. These conversations can reveal insights related to marketing and perception, not just product functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.
*   **Operationalizing Insights**:
    *   Insights are operationalized through a recurring cadence with the sales team to understand customer pain points and inform roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.
    *   Creating artifacts, like Loom videos demonstrating product usage, helps the sales team evangelize new features and use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.
    *   For insights not immediately actionable, a Slack-to-Asana integration allows feedback to be turned into backlog tasks for weekly grooming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **[[collaboration_between_product_and_sales_teams | Collaboration with Sales Teams]]**: For larger companies, maintaining a tight relationship with the sales team and joining sales calls ensures customer pain points cross-pollinate into the product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

## Founding Within an Existing Company (Zero to One)

Mahika is Figma's go-to person for zero-to-one initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. For a company to remain competitive, it must stay entrepreneurial and constantly define the next industry standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>. Figma's "run with it" culture encourages individuals to pursue new directions, viewing it as a manifestation of company values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>. Many of Figma's monumental launches, like multi-edit, Jambot, and the widgets platform, originated from hackathons and bottom-up projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>.

Bringing a new idea into existence requires three key elements:

1.  **Have the Right Idea**: This involves deep [[developing_user_empathy_and_gathering_insights_for_product_development | user empathy]], constantly understanding pain points and the full end-to-end tooling usage of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>. The idea must also align with broader company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.
2.  **Secure Buy-in**: This demands an "optimism that borders on delusion," a "reality distortion field" where "no" is heard as "not yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. Pitches may not succeed initially, requiring persistence and leveraging opportunities like hackathons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>. Scrappiness is key, focusing on minimal changes that communicate the core difference of the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>.
3.  **Make it Spread Like Wildfire**:
    *   **Dogfooding/Staging**: Figma utilizes a multi-month dogfooding process, releasing products early to internal users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. This not only provides critical feedback but also makes people invested in the product, as they see their feedback incorporated, creating a sense of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:14">[01:28:14]</a>.
    *   **Team Sport**: [[Developing a product strategy | Product development]] is a team sport; involving people early elevates the product's quality and fosters collective investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:55">[01:28:55]</a>.

## Personal Qualities and Culture

Mahika's deep care for the product is infectious, making her team care deeply as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:47">[01:51:47]</a>.

*   **Deep Belief**: The more a PM believes in an idea, the more naturally passionate they are about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>.
*   **Proactive Culture Building**: Instead of waiting for top-down initiatives, Mahika starts her own rituals, like "Hot Seat" (a game for PMs to get to know each other personally) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a> and "The Figgies" (an Oscar-style awards ceremony to appreciate the product team's quirks and energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. These low-cost, high-impact activities build trust and emotional connection within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.
*   **Understanding Motivations**: A key to running a team successfully and driving an idea forward is understanding the motivations of individual team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:09">[01:30:09]</a>. Some engineers, for example, prefer solutions handed to them, while others need to contribute to the [[crafting_a_compelling_product_vision | vision]] to feel passionate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>. Catering to individuals rather than the average leads to a higher-functioning team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Directly asking team members how much they want to be involved in product decisions is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>.
*   **Embracing Change**: Mahika has a superpower of pivoting with grace and enthusiasm when priorities change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. This stems from a high sense of agency, a willingness to chase after ideas even without formal backing, and adaptability in resourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.
*   **Shouting Insights**: If a PM has a unique insight that others aren't seeing, it is their responsibility to "shout from the rooftops" to get everyone on the same page, fostering a more entrepreneurial culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>.

Michael Tru, co-founder and CEO of Any Sphere, the company behind Cursor, shares insights into building and managing a successful tech team, particularly within the fast-paced environment of an AI startup. Cursor is recognized as a leading AI code editor and one of the fastest-growing products of all time, reaching $100 million ARR in 20 months and $300 million ARR in two years since its launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### Initial Hiring Approach: Too Slow
Counterintuitively, while many advise against [[hiring_and_retaining_top_talent_in_tech | hiring too fast]], Cursor initially [[hiring_and_retaining_top_talent_in_tech | hired too slowly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. The team intentionally waited a long time to grow, prioritizing patience in the [[hiring_and_retaining_top_talent_in_tech | hiring]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. This deliberate approach, though slow, was rooted in a strong belief in the importance of a world-class engineering and research group for the company's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

### Criteria for [[hiring_and_retaining_top_talent_in_tech | Hiring Top Talent]]
A core part of Cursor's success is its focus on [[hiring_and_retaining_top_talent_in_tech | recruiting]] individuals who possess a specific mix of attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>:
*   **Intellectual Curiosity and Experimentation** This is crucial given the constant need to build new things in a rapidly evolving field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Honesty and Micro Pessimism** Maintaining a level head amidst the industry's noise and growth is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.
*   **Focus on Building Great Products** The team seeks individuals less concerned with external validation and more dedicated to high-quality work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>.
*   **Level-Headed Disposition** People who maintain an even keel, avoiding extreme highs or lows, contribute to a stable team environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.

Initially, Cursor tended to bias towards candidates from "well-known schools," who were "very young" and had "high credential" achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>. However, they found significant success by expanding their search to include "later careered" individuals and those with profiles that might be "slightly different from... straight out of central casting" but were still excellent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

### The Two-Day Work Test
A unique and highly effective part of Cursor's [[hiring_and_retaining_top_talent_in_tech | hiring]] process is a two-day, on-site work test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>.
*   **Real Project Experience** Candidates work on a real, albeit mock, mini-project within Cursor's codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.
*   **Collaboration and Fit** This format allows the team to assess a candidate's real-world work product and determine cultural fit over an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. Being around the person for two days, including meals, helps ensure mutual compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a>.
*   **Scalability** Despite initial doubts, this method has proven surprisingly scalable, allowing for in-depth evaluation without being overly time-intensive for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **Early-Stage Advantage** In the early stages of the company, before the product was widely known, this immersive experience was crucial for convincing candidates to "throw in with us" by demonstrating the team's unique qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

### Team Composition and [[building_a_startup_culture | Culture]]
Cursor's team is notably small for its scale and impact, currently at around 60 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. A very high percentage of the team comprises engineers, researchers, and designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.
*   **Product-Led Growth** The company started with an "incredibly lean" and "productled" approach, deferring traditional sales and marketing efforts to focus on product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This means a strong emphasis on building a product the team loves and then adjusting it based on user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Company Model** Cursor operates as a hybrid between a traditional software company and a foundation model company, requiring expertise in both product development for millions of users and scientific advancements in models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

### [[Optimizing hiring and team management for tech startups | Managing Focus]] in a Rapidly Evolving AI Landscape
Operating at the "white hot center" of AI, Cursor employs several strategies to help its team stay focused and avoid distractions from constant launches and chatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>:
*   **[[hiring_and_team_dynamics_in_highgrowth_ai_startups | Hiring the Right Disposition]]** As mentioned, hiring level-headed individuals who prioritize building great products is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.
*   **Open Communication** Regularly discussing challenges and priorities as a company helps maintain alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.
*   **Leading by Example** Leadership sets the tone for focus and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.
*   **Building an "Immune System"** The team has developed an ability to discern which new technologies or ideas genuinely matter for the business, ignoring the vast majority of fleeting trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.
*   **Lean Process** By [[hiring_and_retaining_top_talent_in_tech | hiring]] excellent people, Cursor has been able to operate with less formal process on the engineering front, allowing for agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.

Tru believes that the fundamental demand for software will continue to increase, leading to a long-term need for engineers who can leverage advanced tools like Cursor to build more efficiently and creatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.

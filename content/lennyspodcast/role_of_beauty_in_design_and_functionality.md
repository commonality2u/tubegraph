From: [[lennyspodcast]] <br/> 

The term "beauty" has seen a dramatic decrease in usage in digitized books from the 1800s to the 2000s, reflecting a cultural shift towards prioritizing functionality as king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">00:22:12</a>. This often creates a false dichotomy, where beauty and functionality are seen as opposing forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">00:00:09</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">00:22:36</a>. However, in reality, beauty enhances functionality, making products easier to use, more approachable, and more compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">00:00:16</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">00:22:45</a>.

## The Business Case for Beauty and Quality

The [[importance_of_design_in_modern_products | importance of design]] extends beyond mere utility, influencing user emotions and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">00:00:32</a>. Products that are more beautiful tend to increase trust, as users perceive that painstaking detail and care have been put into the observable elements, leading them to believe that similar care is applied to unseen details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">00:00:43</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">00:24:23</a>. This emotional connection is often overlooked in business discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">00:00:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">00:23:17</a>.

### Quality as a Growth Driver

Quality is not merely a "nice-to-have" but a direct driver of [[impact_of_design_on_business_growth | business growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">00:15:43</a>. Companies that recognize quality as non-negotiable understand that it is a long-term, necessary aspect of what they build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">00:13:30</a>. Making a product easier to use and more understandable directly encourages people to use it more, leading to a better experience they will share with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">00:15:52</a>.

Stripe's growth team, for instance, focuses maniacally on building better experiences because it directly ties to business metrics. Improvements in onboarding flows, making products easier to understand, have led to increased activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">00:16:09</a>.

A significant example of [[impact_of_design_on_business_growth | business impact through quality]] is in checkout experiences. Research by Stripe on top e-commerce sites revealed that 99% had errors in their checkout flows, hindering seamless and quicker transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">00:16:47</a>. By improving the quality of the checkout experience, Stripe observed a 10.5% increase in businesses' revenue when transitioning from an older to a newer checkout form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">00:17:33</a>. These small details, when executed with quality, have a material impact on revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">00:17:46</a>.

### Defining Great Design and Beauty

Great design integrates utility, usability, and desirability to create something truly great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">00:32:37</a>. Beauty plays a role here, making things more useful and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">00:20:39</a>. While utility is crucial, beauty enhances it, allowing products to be utilized for all their worth and gain esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">00:21:10</a>. Design is fundamentally about intention â€“ bringing intentionality to decisions and considering the user's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">01:19:42</a>.

Drawing from "Beauty" by Sagmeister & Walsh, there is an objective element to whether beauty enhances things; wide audiences often agree on what they find aesthetically pleasing due to a shared understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">00:23:00</a>. An example of this is the contrasting user sentiment between Penn Station and Grand Central Station, where the more aesthetically pleasing Grand Central evoked more positive feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">00:23:30</a>.

For Stripe, a financial infrastructure company in the B2B space, beauty is a key priority for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">00:24:11</a>:
1.  **Increases trust:** Painstaking detail signals care, building user confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">00:24:23</a>.
2.  **Easier to use:** Leads to better user outcomes and empowers businesses to make better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">00:24:37</a>.
3.  **Beauty begets beauty:** When users experience the care and creativity in a product, it reinforces trust and pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">00:25:00</a>.
4.  **Matter of pride:** High-quality work attracts talent who want their craft recognized and utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">00:25:47</a>.

## [[strategies_for_operationalizing_quality_in_design | Operationalizing Quality and Beauty]]

Maintaining high quality is an ongoing pursuit of excellence, especially as companies grow; the gravitational pull is towards mediocrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">00:26:53</a>.

### Key Principles for Quality

From conversations with various design and product leaders, common themes for achieving quality emerge:
1.  **Group Effort:** Quality is a shared responsibility across the organization, not just one team or role. Internal clarity and standards reflect externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">00:29:29</a>.
2.  **Vision and Alignment:** Without a shared vision, even highly talented individuals may produce disparate, unaligned pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">00:30:20</a>. Like building a house, a clear plan and coordination (e.g., General Contractor, architect) are essential to ensure all parts fit together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">00:30:48</a>.
3.  **Editing and Courage:** Leaders need the courage to say "no, this isn't good enough" and push for higher standards, even when it means rejecting significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">00:31:21</a>. This builds the "fitness" of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">00:32:25</a>.
4.  **User Perspective:** Understanding quality from the user's perspective, especially across their entire journey, is critical for empathy and identifying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">00:32:37</a>.

### The "Walk the Store" Program

Stripe implemented a "Walk the Store" program to combat quality regression over time, which can occur as new features are added without considering the overall user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">00:34:10</a>. The program aims to increase awareness and accountability among leaders for owning user journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">00:34:45</a>.

Key aspects of the program:
*   **Critical User Journeys:** Leaders are assigned responsibility for 15 essential user journeys that are critical to get right at the highest quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">00:34:56</a>.
*   **Regular Review:** Leaders from engineering, product, and design review these journeys regularly, "walking the store" as if they were users. They friction log their experiences, noting what works and what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">00:35:19</a>. This involves starting from an internet search, navigating the website, documentation, and the dashboard, replicating a user's comprehensive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">00:36:03</a>.
*   **Scoring and Calibration:** Teams score their journeys based on a rubric that considers usability, utility, desirability, and whether it's "surprisingly great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">00:45:12</a>. These scores are calibrated in "Product Quality Review" (PQR) meetings, fostering a shared understanding of the quality bar across the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">00:36:33</a>.
*   **Impact:** This process fosters deeper understanding of user pain points, identifies opportunities for product and process improvements, and converts skeptics from other functions who realize the business value of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">00:38:00</a>.

This process emphasizes trusting internal judgment in addition to user research and data. The firsthand experience of pain points is a powerful, visceral motivator for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">00:40:00</a>.

### Prioritizing Quality in Planning

Companies may allocate specific percentages of time in their planning (e.g., 10% for fixing, 20% for growth) to ensure quality efforts are integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">00:46:57</a>. At Stripe, while no rigid formula exists, the expectation is that individuals with strong judgment and pride in their work will inherently prioritize quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">00:47:41</a>. Advocacy from the highest levels of the company reinforces this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">00:47:59</a>. Ultimately, quality improvements demonstrably increase growth and improve the bottom line, even if some impacts are longer term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">00:48:44</a>.

Performance evaluations should define "impact" broadly, recognizing long-term or harder-to-measure quality efforts as instrumental to business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">00:50:55</a>. Stripe's level ladder system and operating principles, which include "meticulous craft," reinforce the expectation of quality across all functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">00:52:01</a>.

## Building and Scaling Design Teams

### Performance as Potential Minus Interference

A guiding formula for [[building_highfunctioning_design_teams | building high-functioning design teams]] is: **Performance = Potential - Interference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">00:55:05</a>.
*   **Increase Potential:** Focus on hiring well, developing talent, and fostering growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">00:55:37</a>.
*   **Decrease Interference:** Remove obstacles that hold back great talent, preventing burnout and ensuring success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">00:55:50</a>.

Interferences can be physical or organizational. At Lyft, a key interference was the design team's physical separation from engineering and product, leading to wasted work and misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">01:02:19</a>. By breaking down physical and organizational walls and integrating teams, Lyft achieved faster iteration cycles and better clarity, while still maintaining dedicated creative spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">01:04:07</a>. This pattern was also seen at Airbnb early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">00:59:40</a>.

### Fostering Awareness and Collaboration

As companies grow, people can lose touch with what's happening across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">00:57:14</a>. To improve awareness and collaboration, design teams can regularly share screenshots or prototypes of their work in a shared deck (e.g., Google Slides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">00:57:47</a>. This visual approach fosters communication, helps designers identify similar projects or patterns, and allows product managers, engineers, and leaders to understand the overall progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">00:58:00</a>. It also helps detect redundancies or conflicts early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">01:01:10</a>.

### Fighting the Fear of Bold Ideas

Companies often fear bold ideas due to the difficulty in measuring large, comprehensive changes compared to incremental approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">01:07:52</a>. However, focusing only on incremental changes within narrow scopes often fails to improve the entire product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">01:08:49</a>.

It's crucial to "reach for the stars and land on the Moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">01:09:02</a>. This means:
*   **Vision Work:** Develop a comprehensive vision for the ideal user experience, looking at the entire journey (e.g., Brian Chesky's "11-star experience") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">01:09:06</a>.
*   **North Star:** Sketch out this ideal version, even if it seems unattainable initially. This North Star guides the incremental steps and ensures they lead to the desired long-term outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">01:09:54</a>.
*   **Measured Risk-Taking:** While working towards the vision, individual pieces can be shipped and studied, allowing for learning and data-driven adjustments before moving to the next phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">01:10:30</a>.

### Hiring for Design

When hiring designers, prioritize qualities that are harder to teach than tools and processes:
1.  **Taste and Judgment:** Look for candidates with a natural inclination for great things and strong judgment, even if they lack extensive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">01:11:51</a>. This relates to the [[importance_of_taste_and_standards_in_product_management | importance of taste and standards in product management]].
2.  **Humility:** Humility is crucial for teamwork, respect, empathy, and user understanding. A humble designer is more likely to pay attention to user feedback and strive for continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">01:12:05</a>.
3.  **Hustle/Hutzpah (Courage):** Design involves creation, which can be scary. Look for individuals with the courage to propose new ideas, push for higher standards, and "fight for great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">01:12:47</a>.
4.  **Doer vs. Thinker (for early stage):** In early-stage companies, while a "thinker" (senior operator/advisor) is valuable for strategy and user focus, a "doer" (executor) is usually necessary full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">01:13:43</a>.

## Conclusion

The role of beauty in design is fundamental to achieving great products. It's not just about aesthetics but about creating a more usable, desirable, and trustworthy experience that directly contributes to business growth and user satisfaction. By intentionally integrating beauty and quality through shared vision, rigorous processes, and courageous leadership, companies can build products that truly excel and resonate with their users on a deeper level.

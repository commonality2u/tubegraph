The Facebook News Feed, developed early in the company's history by Andrew "Bos" Bosworth and others, revolutionized social networking and became a core part of what people think of as Facebook today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Bosworth, who joined Facebook in early 2006 as one of the first engineers, was instrumental in its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Early Challenges and User Resistance
Developing the News Feed was a significant undertaking marked by intense effort and user backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Early engineers, including Bosworth, worked incredibly long hours, with Bosworth himself not sleeping more than four hours at a time for about two years due to needing to check anti-spam reports constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This intense period of work, often depicted romantically, was in reality far from glamorous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

When the News Feed first launched, it faced significant controversy, with people not wanting their information shared this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. However, despite the outrage, users immediately doubled their product usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This phenomenon highlighted a "cognitive dissonance" between users' stated preferences (dislike) and their revealed preferences (increased engagement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

## Innovation and Impact
The News Feed was the first-ever algorithmically ranked content feed on any social network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. It also incorporated what was likely the first consumer AI code used in a website to rank content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>. The combination of News Feed and ads created over a trillion dollars in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

### Leadership Involvement
Mark Zuckerberg was deeply involved in the development of the News Feed, to the point of whiteboarding almost every pixel for the UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>. This level of intense involvement is referred to internally at Meta as being under the "eye of Sauron," where no detail is too small for Zuckerberg's notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

## Key Lessons from the Experience
1.  **Trusting your Conviction**: Sometimes, founders must have conviction in their vision, especially when users initially reject a new product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. It's about choosing your customers as much as they choose you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. However, this doesn't mean ignoring customers entirely; it's crucial to distinguish between fundamental product flaws and correctable "small mistakes" in execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.

2.  **Passion and Productivity**: Building the News Feed was all-consuming for Bosworth, leading him to realize that passion for a project leads to better, smarter, and orders-of-magnitude more productive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. While not everyone can inherently be passionate about everything, it's valuable to cultivate the ability to find passion in new areas and give new roles space to ignite that excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. If passion isn't found after a few months, it might be time to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.

3.  **Optimizing for Learning**: Early in a career, it's beneficial to optimize for learning and diverse experiences, even if it means slower initial promotions compared to peers who specialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. This variety builds valuable skills that pay off significantly later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.
    *   Bosworth's own career path involved frequently changing roles early on (e.g., integrity, site speed, infrastructure, boot camp, messaging, groups) before settling into longer leadership roles in ads and then AR/VR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.

4.  **Strategic Focus for Leaders**: Leaders, especially founders, need to judge "which weeds matter" â€“ identifying the critical details that will determine success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. While some areas can be delegated, others require deep involvement to ensure the right outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.
    *   There are two good places to be in a company: carrying a lot of water in important but overlooked areas, or working on the *most important thing* at the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. The latter provides invaluable experience and visibility, even if it means a smaller piece of the pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

5.  **Organizational Communication**: [[communication_is_the_job | Communication is the job]] for leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>. If a task isn't done correctly, it's often the manager's responsibility for not communicating clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. Every action, even silence, communicates something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>. Effective communication involves understanding the audience's mental model and crafting language and presence to guide them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>.

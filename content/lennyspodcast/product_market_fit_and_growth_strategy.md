Growth is a relatively new field, leading to a lot of interest in "growth hacks" or sure-fire ways to achieve growth, particularly in the age of social media where numerous tips and tricks are shared, often out of context or specific to one example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This often results in a lot of failure within growth teams, leading to high turnover for heads of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Growth Tactics That Never Work

Elena Verna, a seasoned B2B growth expert who has led growth at companies like Miro, Amplitude, Dropbox, and SurveyMonkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, highlights several common growth strategies and tactics that, despite significant resource investment, consistently fail to produce meaningful results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

### 1. Hiring a Growth Team Too Soon

A significant misconception, especially among startups, is the belief that growth requires a dedicated growth team to figure out [[product_market_fit_strategies | product market fit]] and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. This is often untrue. Founders and founding teams must first determine how to grow the company to its initial revenue milestones (e.g., $1 million, $5 million, or even $10 million ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Many companies don't form growth teams until they reach $100-$200 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

The process of [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | finding product-market fit in startups]] and distribution cannot be outsourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. A growth team cannot wave a magic wand to achieve viral campaigns or significant sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Instead, [[finding_productmarket_fit_in_startups | founder-led growth]] is crucial until there's enough user volume for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

Two specific reasons to delay hiring a growth team:
*   **Solid Product-Market Fit (PMF):** You need a solution to a problem with customers who are not only using it but also retaining and staying with the product. This can be measured by retention or the "Chanel Score" (how many people couldn't live without your product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Sufficient Data:** Growth teams require data to analyze, form hypotheses, and apply experimentation. Ten users or customers are not enough data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Founder-led growth is essential, as the longer a company waits to hire a growth team, the more the entire organization becomes responsible for growth, rather than isolating it to a single department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

For B2B SaaS companies, if primary revenue collection is through sales, hiring sales personnel should precede growth teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Growth teams are more critical for self-serve revenue models (e.g., freemium, trial acquisition) where the product is designed to sell itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. A head of growth should generally only be hired for an established company that has achieved clear [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product-market fit]] and relies on product-led motions for growth levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

### 2. Hiring a Growth Team to Reverse Business Decline

Bringing in a "shiny growth head" or team to fix an overall business slowdown is often a path to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. A growth team can optimize and lift growth by 10-15%, but it cannot resolve deeper issues like core product or marketing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Growth amplifies existing [[the_importance_and_stages_of_productmarket_fit | product-market fit]] and accelerates growth when a company is already expanding. If the business is slowing due to issues with its [[building_a_strong_gotomarket_strategy | go-to-market strategy]] or core [[product_market_fit_strategies | product-market fit]], a growth team will be "absolutely helpless" and a waste of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

Before hiring a growth head in an established company experiencing decline, the organization's core product and marketing teams should first stabilize the decline and show signs of potential recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

### 3. Rebranding or Redesigning for Growth

Rebranding or redesigning a marketing site to drive growth is almost universally ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. While there are valid reasons for a rebrand (e.g., entering a new market, product evolution), these are lagging indicators that a change is needed, and they often lead to a temporary step backward in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] "Never ever once have I seen a Rebrand or redesign especially of you your marketing site produce good performance results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>

Often, new CMOs initiate rebrands based on personal taste, promising increased acquisition and awareness that rarely materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Such initiatives are expensive (often over $1 million), time-consuming (8-10 months minimum), and yield lackluster results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] If a rebrand is necessary, go into it with "eyes wide open," understanding it will likely be a step back in performance, and dedicate 3-6 months post-launch for optimization to recover and potentially outperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### 4. Blindly Copying Competition

While understanding competitors and drawing inspiration from their experiences is valuable for ideation, simply copying their "best tactics" or flows is highly ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Every product experience is unique to its customers and channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Copying can lead to subpar results 95% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Copying competition is the "fastest way to mediocracy" as it prevents a company from becoming a leader that stands out from the pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

Furthermore, relying on benchmarks from competitors can be misleading because definitions of metrics (e.g., sign-ups, conversion rates) vary significantly between companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Benchmarks should be inputs for decision-making, not blind targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

### 5. Believing Your Problem is Unique

The notion that a company's growth problem is unique and requires a ground-up solution is almost always false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. With so many startups and people in the industry, most problems have been solved, or there are many failures to learn from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Starting from scratch on a problem is a significant waste of time and cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

Instead:
*   Look at how competitors address the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   Find and talk to people who have solved similar problems (e.g., via LinkedIn, X, or your network) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   Focus on patternization to develop frameworks that solve not just one problem but similar ones, allowing for faster progress to at least 60% of a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

### 6. Over-prioritizing SEO/SEM/Social (Paid Channels)

While organic and paid search (SEO/SEM) and social media advertising can be valuable, a growth team's primary focus should be on creating "owned" or "earned" channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Channels like Google or social media platforms are controlled by others, making companies dependent on algorithms that can change at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Relying heavily on paid channels means paying for distribution and access to someone else's audience, losing control over your growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

**Earned channels** refer to [[marketplace_growth_strategies | product-led growth acquisition]] strategies that rely on virality, word-of-mouth, or user-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. These channels are unique to a company and cannot be easily replicated or competed with by rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. For example, Dropbox's sharing loop generates over 50% of its acquisition, an earned channel nobody else can compete with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Growth teams must invest in virality and user-generated content to build their own earned acquisition channels. Otherwise, the cost of acquisition will rise, competition in paid channels will intensify, and dependency on algorithm changes will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

### 7. Not Evolving Growth Models / Not Overlaying Growth Models

Companies often start with a single growth model (e.g., product-led or sales/marketing-led) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. While it's good to optimize and scale what works, that initial growth model will not last forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Companies need to constantly evolve by overlaying other growth models (product-led, marketing-led, sales-led) on top of existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

This diversification is crucial for two reasons:
1.  **Mitigating Failure:** Prevents reliance on a single model that might eventually fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Addressing Diminishing Returns:** Growth models often have limited lifespans, with many spinning out within 5-7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. Continually seeking new "S-curves" of growth is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Don't wait for growth to slow down. Roughly 20-25% of a growth team's annual time should be dedicated to introducing new growth loops, channels, or initiatives, even if many will fail. This allows for experimentation and development of future growth engines, which can take 6 months to 1.5 years to yield visible revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

Examples of growth loops and levers to consider:
*   **User-Generated Content (UGC):** Harnessing UGC (templates, case studies, reviews) for content strategy, library creation, activation, and acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.
*   **Referral Mechanisms:** For B2C, straightforward referrals. For B2B, inviting other team members or creating product functionality that encourages sharing (e.g., generating reports to share with managers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

### 8. Not Hiring Advisors

Not hiring advisors is a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. Advisors provide access to networks and patterns that can propel a company forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. They serve as additional inputs for decision-making, offering insights from their extensive experience at various companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] To vet advisors, conduct a paid workshop on a specific problem you're facing. Observe their interaction with your team and the information they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Hire those who are transparent and can offer practical insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. Continuously evaluate their value monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

### 9. Too Much Risk Averseness / Testing Everything

While experimentation is fundamental to growth, testing every initiative can be a "paralyzing disease" that slows down progress, velocity, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] If a team needs a "precise scientific measurement" for every change before it goes to production, it's a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

Heuristics for deciding when *not* to test:
*   **Low Volume Real Estate:** If collecting a sufficient sample size for a test would take more than a month (e.g., eight months), it's not worth testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
*   **Trust Intuition:** Develop and trust your intuition, as data is only good when there's enough of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
*   **Pre vs. Post Analysis:** For smaller changes, a pre-versus-post analysis is often sufficient to assess impact, allowing for rollbacks if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Pivots & High Traffic:** Reserve rigorous scientific experimentation for significant strategic pivots or very high-traffic areas where even small percentage differences equate to millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Teams should focus on "go, go, go" and embrace failure. Statistics should be seen as directional data points, not as absolute guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

### 10. Quick Fire "Growth Tactics" to Avoid

*   **Color Optimizations:** Testing shades of colors (e.g., blue vs. green) is an outdated tactic and a waste of time. As long as it's accessible and bright enough, pick a color and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Sign-ups (for acquisition):** Adding options like Google, Facebook, or Slack OAuth rarely drives incremental acquisition. It typically results in a "mix shift" where existing users choose a different sign-up method, but it doesn't improve overall acquisition, activation, or retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. It's a customer experience investment, not a growth tactic, unless for specific cases like developer products needing GitHub OAuth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.
*   **One-Email Wonders:** Stressing over the "lift" from a single email is pointless. Due to low open and click rates, one-off emails will never achieve significant lift. Email should be thought of as a multi-part series, a communication strategy that interacts with product communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.
*   **Removing Friction (Blindly):** While removing "horrible friction" where users are confused is good, simply removing steps or oversimplifying to the point of losing product identity is a failed tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. "Simplifying onboarding" should never be a line item on a roadmap; instead, identify the core problem (e.g., user confusion, lack of education) that simplifying might be a solution to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>.

## Recommended Growth Frameworks

Frameworks are not solutions but patterns that exist across companies, serving as starting points for ideation and potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.

1.  **Growth Loops:** Essential for understanding sustainable growth. This framework focuses on action-reaction cycles that generate further actions, creating a self-contained flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. Resources from Reforge (Brian Balfour, Casey Winters, Andrew Chen) are highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>.
2.  **Race Car Framework:** Helps in understanding different types of growth initiatives: engines (loops), fuel (e.g., paid marketing), turbo boosts (e.g., big conferences), and lubrications/optimizations (e.g., oil for the engine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.
3.  **Adjacent User Theory (by Ravi Mistry):** Powerful for thinking about growth evolution and adding different growth models. It also considers how growth teams can bring in "adjacent users" (outside the ideal customer profile) and optimize their experiences without necessarily expanding product market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.

## Career Optionality as a Personal Growth Strategy

Full-time jobs are not the only or necessarily the best way to monetize one's skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>. Many people "blindly default" to full-time roles without exploring other options that might better suit their personality, interests, and skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.

Other options include:
*   Freelancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>
*   Contracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>
*   Advising and Consulting (allowing for horizontal exposure across many companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>
*   Interim engagements with predetermined end dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>
*   Fractional engagements (part-time work) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>
*   Creating courses or newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>

The goal should be **career optionality**, not just aiming for a specific title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a>. Many find dissatisfaction upon reaching perceived corporate "North Stars." Instead, evaluate opportunities based on whether they increase your "option pool" for the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Building depth and real experience, often through full-time jobs, is necessary to earn the right to unlock optionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>. However, it's not a "one-way door"; one can transition between full-time roles, advising, and other engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>.

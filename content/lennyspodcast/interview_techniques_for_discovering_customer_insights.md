Understanding customer insights is crucial for product development and innovation. The Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework, co-created by Bob Moesta and Clay Christensen, offers a unique lens for achieving this by focusing on the "struggling moments" and contexts that drive customers to seek progress in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Core Principles of Jobs to be Done

A common misconception about Jobs to be Done is that it's solely about "pain and gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Instead, it emphasizes **context and outcome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Understanding the full story and context makes seemingly "irrational" customer behaviors rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

The fundamental premise of JTBD is that people "hire" products and services to make progress in their lives, rather than simply "buying" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This perspective helps companies identify their true competitive set from the "demand side" of the market, as opposed to the "supply side" (i.e., competitors offering similar technologies or business models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. For example, a Snickers bar might compete with a protein drink or coffee when a customer is hungry and needs quick energy, while a Milky Way might compete with a glass of wine or a run when a customer seeks comfort after an emotional experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### The Origin of Demand: Struggling Moments

Demand is caused by a **struggling moment**, not by the creation of a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. These struggling moments are the "seed for real innovation" and where new products emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. By studying these moments, companies like Intercom and Basecamp build their roadmaps around addressing specific customer struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### The Four Forces of Progress

Bob Moesta illustrates the customer decision-making process with four forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>:

1.  **F1: The Push of the Situation:** The context or "push" that makes a customer consider leaving their old product or situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Without this push, customers may not even see a new product, as they are creatures of habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
2.  **F2: The Pull of the New Solution:** The attraction to a new outcome or state offered by a potential solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
3.  **F3: Anxiety of the New:** The anxieties and fears associated with adopting a new product or change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Counterintuitively, adding too many features can increase this anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
4.  **F4: Habit of the Present:** The inertia and comfort of sticking with the current product or situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Customers will only make a change if the pushes (F1) and pulls (F2) are greater than the anxieties (F3) and habits (F4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This means that reducing friction (F3 and F4) can be as, or more, impactful than simply adding more features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## Customer Interviewing Techniques

When engaging in [[customer_interviewing_techniques | customer interviewing techniques]] for product development, the goal is to understand the causation behind customer behavior, not just stated preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This approach shifts the focus from selling to enabling customers to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Phases of the Buying Process

Customers typically go through six phases when making a significant purchase or change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>:

1.  **First Thought:** The initial spark of realizing a need or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
2.  **Passive Looking:** Problem-aware but solution-unaware; learning about the landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
3.  **Active Looking:** Problem and solution-aware; actively framing a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
4.  **Deciding:** Making trade-offs between alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
5.  **First Use:** Initial experience with the new product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
6.  **Ongoing Use:** Integrating the product into daily habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

Meeting customers where they are in their buying process, rather than trying to force them into a sales funnel, can significantly improve conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. For example, tailoring product demos to different phases can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

### Interviewing Best Practices for Discovering Insights

*   **Focus on Past Behavior:** Do not ask people what they *will* do, as this is unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. Instead, ask about what they *did* and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. People often don't know why they bought something until they reflect on the context surrounding the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.
*   **Target Recent Purchasers:** Interview people who have recently "hired" a product (including your own or a competitor's) to understand their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
*   **Interview Churners:** Talking to customers who have churned can reveal critical struggling moments that led them to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.
*   **Listen to the Story:** Focus on extracting the full story, including pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
*   **No Discussion Guide:** Avoid rigid discussion guides, as they can prevent you from following meaningful tangents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Instead, use the four forces (pushes, pulls, anxieties, habits) as a framework for the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **Mirroring and Probing:**
    *   **"Tell me more about that"** or **"Give me an example"** are powerful phrases to encourage elaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
    *   Mirroring back what you hear, sometimes intentionally incorrectly, can prompt the interviewee to correct you and provide more details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. This draws from techniques in books like "Never Split the Difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
    *   Force them to elaborate by bracketing options: "Was it more about this or more about that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.
*   **Unpack Layers of Language:** Customers often start with superficial or "fantasy nightmare" answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. Be an "investigator and interrogator" to uncover the actual events and causal mechanisms behind their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.
*   **Sample Size:** For causal insights, 10-12 interviews can reveal repeating patterns of pushes, pulls, anxieties, and habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. This is because you're looking for causation, not just statistical significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.
*   **Identify Energy Sources:** Look for functional (time, space, effort, knowledge), emotional (frustration, desire for respect), and social (how others perceive them) energies driving behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

### Applying Insights to Product Development

[[Integrating user research effectively into product development | Integrating user research effectively into product development]] through Jobs to be Done means:

*   **Roadmaps of Struggling Moments:** Instead of fixed feature roadmaps, define the struggling moments you aim to address. This allows for flexibility in solutions as technology evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Choose What to "Suck At":** Recognize that products cannot be everything to everyone. Identify the trade-offs your customers are willing to make and align your product's strengths and weaknesses accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. Many products fail because their trade-offs don't align with customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Hypothesize Jobs:** The biggest mistake is trying to define jobs in a conference room without talking to real people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:56]</a>. Always go out and observe actual behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>.

## When JTBD May Not Be the Right Fit

JTBD is less effective where customers have **no real choice** or where the choice is obvious and deeply habitual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. For example, understanding why someone chooses health insurance when it's provided by an employer, or why they buy chewing gum (a deeply ingrained habit), is difficult using this framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. In such cases, ethnographic studies or prototyping to identify frictional points might be more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. The framework truly shines when people are actively changing their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

## Recommended Reading

For those looking to dive deeper into this approach, Bob Moesta recommends his book, *Demands Side Sales*, which frames the entire method around understanding how people buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

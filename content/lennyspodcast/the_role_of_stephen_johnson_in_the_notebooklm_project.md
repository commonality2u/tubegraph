Stephen Johnson plays a unique and influential role in the [[notebooklm_ai_product_development_at_google_labs | NotebookLM]] project, particularly within [[startuplike_operations_within_google_labs | Google Labs]]. His involvement began early in the project's development, and his expertise in language, information, and knowledge has significantly shaped the product's vision and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

## Early Involvement and Team Dynamics
[[notebooklm_ai_product_development_at_google_labs | NotebookLM]] originated as a "20% project" at Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Risa Martin, the Product Lead for [[notebooklm_ai_product_development_at_google_labs | NotebookLM]], recalls that Stephen Johnson eventually joined what was initially a very small team, consisting of just herself and an engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Although the engineer was the only full-time person on the technology in the very early days, Stephen, along with others, chimed in, finding the project "super interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

When Project Tailwind (an earlier name for [[notebooklm_ai_product_development_at_google_labs | NotebookLM]]) was announced at I/O, the core team consisted of just three engineers, Risa Martin, a designer, and Stephen Johnson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Risa Martin notes that she initially wasn't sure what capacity Stephen would work in, given his distinguished background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

## Influence on Product Vision
Stephen Johnson is described as "the most curious, most respectful, and really just full of ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. Risa Martin closely observed Stephen's workflow, his thought processes regarding language, information, and knowledge, and how he shares these with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. His approach to research, which involves extensive work, became a metric for the team to "crunch that down" and bring his expertise to everyday people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>.

Risa explicitly told Stephen, "I think you're the product. I think it's you," and committed to watching his processes to figure out how to use technology to build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>. His unique workflows, such as maintaining 8,000 quotes in Readwise, highlight a "super flow" that the team aims to make accessible to a broader audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. Stephen is considered a great partner for ideas, engaging in banter and contributing to how people might use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>.

Despite occasional disagreements, their working relationship is characterized by mutual respect, leading to alignment on next steps even when initial opinions differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.

## Stephen Johnson: A Brief Bio
Stephen Johnson is a New York Times best-selling author and speaker, having written 14 books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. He also hosts a show on PBS and is known as a journalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. Risa Martin was first introduced to his work through his article "How AI Is Mastering Language. Should We Trust What It Says?" from the New York Times, which inspired her to join [[startuplike_operations_within_google_labs | Google Labs]] and work on AI products before she even knew Stephen would be joining the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>.

The collaboration with Stephen Johnson underscores a key lesson for product development: the importance of deeply understanding users by "sitting with them for meaningful periods of time" to generate crucial product insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

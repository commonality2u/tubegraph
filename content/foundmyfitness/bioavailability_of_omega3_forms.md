Omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential fatty acids that the human body cannot produce and must obtain through diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Data from the National Center of Health Statistics indicates that [[importance_of_omega3_fatty_acids_for_health | omega-3 fatty acids]] are one of the top dietary factors influencing early mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

While [[benefits_of_omega3_fatty_acids | omega-3 fatty acids]] offer numerous [[role_of_omega3_in_longevity_and_health | benefits]], such as lowering all-cause mortality, slowing telomere attrition, delaying [[omega3_fatty_acids_and_brain_health | brain aging]] and atrophy, reducing inflammation, increasing HDL, lowering triglycerides, and supporting cell membrane fluidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, their effectiveness is greatly influenced by their bioavailability. This article compares the bioavailability of different forms of omega-3s found in fish oil and krill oil.

## Forms of Omega-3 Fatty Acids

### Fish Oil
Fish oil often undergoes molecular distillation to concentrate EPA and DHA and remove contaminants like mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This process typically converts omega-3 fatty acids from their naturally occurring triglyceride form (three fatty acids bound to a glycerol backbone) into an ethyl ester form, where the glycerol backbone is replaced with an ethanol backbone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Although omega-3s can be re-esterified back into triglyceride form after distillation, most fish oil supplements on the market remain in the ethyl ester form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Krill Oil
The omega-3 fatty acids found in krill oil are predominantly in phospholipid form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Phospholipids consist of a fat-soluble diacylglycerol and a water-soluble phosphate group attached to an organic molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Bioavailability Comparison

The bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids is significantly affected by how they are absorbed in the small intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Absorption Mechanisms
*   **Fish Oil (Triglyceride and Ethyl Ester)**: For EPA and DHA from fish oil to be absorbed, they must first be cleaved by pancreatic lipase enzymes in the small intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This cleavage separates the fatty acids from their glycerol or ethanol backbone, converting them into free omega-3 fatty acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Krill Oil (Phospholipid)**: Omega-3 fatty acids in krill oil can also be cleaved by phospholipase enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. However, a key advantage is that phospholipids do not necessarily need to be cleaved; they can form micelles and be absorbed in their intact form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Relative Bioavailability
*   **Ethyl Esters**: These are poor substrates for pancreatic lipase and consequently are not absorbed very well in the small intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Triglycerides**: Omega-3 fatty acids in triglyceride form are more bioavailable than those in ethyl ester form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, they are less bioavailable than those in phospholipid form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This is partly because gastric lipases in the stomach can break down fatty acids in triglycerides, which is not the case for phospholipids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Phospholipids**: Omega-3 fatty acids in phospholipid form are the most bioavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Their ability to be absorbed intact contributes to this higher bioavailability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Research Findings
Studies have demonstrated the superior bioavailability of omega-3s from krill oil (phospholipid form) compared to fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   Mice given identical doses of EPA and DHA in phospholipid, triglyceride, or ethyl ester forms showed the highest plasma concentrations of EPA and DHA from the phospholipid form, followed by triglyceride, and then ethyl ester <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   Humans consuming krill oil with a 38% lower dose of EPA and DHA than fish oil still achieved the same plasma levels of EPA and DHA as those given fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This suggests that the bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids is higher in krill oil due to its phospholipid form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Brain Preference for DHA Lysophosphatidylcholine
DHA is the most abundant fatty acid in the brain, making up 10-20% of its total lipid composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Recent research shows that DHA lysophosphatidylcholine is the preferred source of DHA for the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This compound is a byproduct of DHA in phosphatidylcholine after cleavage by lipases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Since krill oil is a rich source of phosphatidylcholine, it is also a good source of DHA lysophosphatidylcholine, unlike fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

A specialized DHA transporter called MFSD2A transports DHA lysophosphatidylcholine across the blood-brain barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Mice engineered to lack this transporter had 60% less DHA in their brains compared to control mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Red blood cells also prefer DHA lysophosphatidylcholine over free fatty acid DHA, and red blood cell DHA concentration correlates tightly with brain DHA levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Additional Benefits of Krill Oil
Krill oil also contains astaxanthin, a powerful antioxidant carotenoid that protects against cellular damage from singlet oxygen and peroxy radicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Astaxanthin is easily absorbed and accumulates in cell membranes due to its amphipathic structure, where it can protect DHA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids from oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Clinical trials show astaxanthin supplementation can lower inflammation, decrease DNA damage, and increase HDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Furthermore, krill oil provides other phospholipids like phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. These accumulate in mitochondrial and cell membranes, and their decreasing concentration with age has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

In summary, krill oil generally surpasses fish oil in several key areas. The EPA and DHA in krill oil are more bioavailable due to their phospholipid form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Krill oil is also a superior source of DHA lysophosphatidylcholine, which is the brain's preferred source of DHA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Additionally, krill oil offers the antioxidant astaxanthin and other beneficial phospholipids not found in fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

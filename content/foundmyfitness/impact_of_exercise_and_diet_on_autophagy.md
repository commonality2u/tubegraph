Dr. Guido Kroemer, a professor at the University of Paris Descartes and a cell biologist, has made significant contributions to understanding the role of mitochondria in cell death, with extensive publications in cell biology, cancer biology, immunology, [[role_of_autophagy_in_aging_and_agerelated_diseases | aging]], and [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | Autophagy]] is a cellular process involving the sequestration and digestion of cytoplasmic portions to recycle material and degrade macromolecules into micromolecules and metabolites, allowing for the rebuilding of destroyed structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This self-digestion process involves the autophagosome, which sequesters parts of the cell, including organelles like mitochondria, protein aggregates, bacteria, or viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Once closed, the autophagosome fuses with lysosomes (the "stomach of the cell"), forming an autophagolysosome where the content is digested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

The primary goal of [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] is adaptation to changing conditions and external stress, ultimately avoiding unwarranted cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Although its Greek name "autos phagy" means "self-eating" and implies self-mutilation or self-destruction, inhibition of [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] actually sensitizes cells to cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Diet and Autophagy

[[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | Autophagy]] is largely a response to stress, particularly nutrient sensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Nutrient Deprivation and Pathways
The most physiological and phylogenetically conserved way to induce [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] is nutrient deprivation, starvation, or hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. When a cell is deprived of energy supply (e.g., absence of nutrients, growth factors, or oxygen), it induces [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] to destroy bioenergetic reserves (macromolecules like proteins, lipids, and ribonucleic acids) to generate energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

Key pathways involved in sensing nutrient status and inducing [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] include:
*   **AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)**: Activated when the cell's energetic charge (ATP status) lowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)**: Inhibited by the absence of sufficient amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Protein Assimilation Pathway / Acetyl-CoA Pool**: A reduction in the cytosolic Acetyl-CoA pool (a central metabolite from glucose, amino acid, and fatty acid degradation) leads to deacetylation of hundreds of cellular proteins, which multi-pointedly induces major sub-pathways of the autophagic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This deacetylation also often results in mTOR inhibition and AMPK activation, indicating pathway connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Fasting and Caloric Restriction
*   **Duration for Autophagy Induction**:
    *   In human volunteers, a complete caloric fast for three or four days is needed to see a massive induction of [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] in circulating leukocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
    *   Two days of fasting in mice can cause a 20% weight loss, bringing them to the verge of death, whereas four days of fasting in humans results in only a 1-2% weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. This difference is linked to rodents' higher metabolism due to their surface-to-volume ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
    *   It is unknown if shorter intermittent fasts (e.g., 14-16 hours) induce [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] in human tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. While there are intriguing observations of circadian variations in hepatic [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] in mice based on their eating cycles, this has not been widely extrapolated to other organs or thoroughly studied in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   **Longevity and Sustainability**:
    *   [[effects_of_diet_on_aging | Caloric restriction]] (e.g., 30% less food) and intermittent fasting can both lead to similar [[diet_and_lifestyle_impact_on_longevity | longevity extension]] in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.
    *   Intermittent fasting is logistically simpler to implement in mice compared to caloric restriction, which requires individual housing and precise food measurement, as calorically restricted mice can become aggressive and cannibalistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
    *   For humans, prolonged [[effects_of_diet_on_aging | caloric restriction]] (e.g., 6 years) is difficult to sustain for the majority of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

### Fasting Mimetics and Other Dietary Factors
[[effects_of_diet_on_aging | Caloric restriction mimetics]] (CRMs) are agents that induce similar biochemical changes as starvation or fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. They stimulate [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] by promoting deacetylation reactions, either by inhibiting Acetyl-CoA generation, inhibiting protein acetyltransferases, or activating deacetylases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
*   **Spermidine**: A natural compound found in many foods (e.g., natto, fermented cheese, durian fruit, some vegetables) and produced by gut microbiota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>. It inhibits the protein acetyltransferase EP300, leading to deacetylation and [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] induction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>. Spermidine can extend lifespan in [[effects_of_diet_on_aging | aging]] mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.
*   **Hydroxycitrate**: Inhibits ATP citrate lyase, an enzyme that generates Acetyl-CoA, leading to Acetyl-CoA depletion, deacetylation, and [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.
*   **Resveratrol**: A compound found in red wine, it activates deacetylases, causing hypoacetylation and [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.
*   **Coffee**: Polyphenols in coffee (independent of caffeine) can magnificently induce [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.

## Exercise and Autophagy

[[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | Exercise]] is another inducer of [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   **Skeletal Muscle**: Studies in humans have shown that aerobic, eccentric, and concentric [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | exercise]] can activate [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] in skeletal muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Multiple Tissues**: Whether [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | exercise]] activates [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] in multiple tissues beyond muscle is not well-studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.
*   **Anti-Diabetic Effects**: Endurance training in mice is particularly efficient in inducing [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] and mediates anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects that are dependent on [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] induction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. Genetic inhibition of [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] can prevent these anti-diabetic benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.
*   **Fasted State Exercise**: While there's speculation about synergy, there is no definitive human data on whether [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | exercise]] in a fasted state significantly enhances [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] induction beyond [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | exercise]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

## Autophagy's Role in Health and Disease
[[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | Autophagy]] plays a critical role in maintaining cellular health and is implicated in various diseases.

### Aging and Organelle Turnover
[[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | Autophagy]] can act as a mechanism against [[role_of_autophagy_in_aging_and_agerelated_diseases | aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. When general [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] is stimulated, the machinery preferentially sequesters and destroys organelles and protein aggregates that are slightly damaged or [[role_of_autophagy_in_aging_and_agerelated_diseases | aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.

*   **Mitophagy**: A specialized form of [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] that targets damaged mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. When a mitochondrion is suboptimal in function, its transmembrane potential decreases, signaling enzymes on its surface to cause ubiquitylation and recruitment of [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] adapters, leading to its engulfment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. Dysfunctional mitochondria are preferentially cleared when the demand for [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.
*   **Mitochondrial Biogenesis**: Mitophagy is coupled with mitochondrial biogenesis, meaning the removal of defective mitochondria signals for the production of new, younger ones, thus replenishing the mitochondrial population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.
*   **Metabolic Adaptation**: Mitophagy is crucial for cellular metabolic adaptation, as seen in yeast shifting to glycolysis or the differentiation of macrophages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

### Neurodegenerative Diseases
[[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | Autophagy]] plays an important role in the prevention of [[neurodegenerative_diseases | neurodegenerative diseases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. Most such diseases are caused by the aggregation of poorly built proteins (e.g., amyloid-beta plaques in Alzheimer's, alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's) or deficiencies in autophagic and lysosomal machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. Increasing autophagic turnover is a theoretical strategy to treat [[neurodegenerative_diseases | neurodegeneration]] by reducing these toxic protein aggregates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.
*   **PINK/Parkin Pathway**: This pathway marks damaged mitochondria for destruction. Its inhibition leads to the accumulation of malfunctioning mitochondria, resulting in inefficient bioenergetic metabolism, production of reactive oxygen species, and potential cellular suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

### Cancer
The role of [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] in cancer is complex:
*   **Cancer Prevention**: In early oncogenesis, the suppression of [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] (e.g., due to tumor suppressor gene deletion or oncogene activation) favors genomic instability and malignant transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. Inhibition of [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] alone can lead to oncogenesis, particularly leukemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.
*   **Cancer Treatment**: Later, cancer cells reactivate [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] to cope with hostile microenvironments (hypoxia, malnourishment, chemotherapy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. Inhibiting [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_links | autophagy]] has been proposed to make cancer cells more vulnerable to therapy, but clinical trials with direct [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] inhibitors (like chloroquine) have not been convincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.
*   **Immune Response**: [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | Autophagy]] is required for stressed cells to release ATP into the microenvironment, which acts as a danger signal for immune cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. This ATP release can attract myeloid cells and initiate an immune response against tumor antigens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. The capacity of chemotherapy to induce [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] is crucial for the long-term efficacy of the treatment, as it fuels the anti-cancer immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.
*   **Fasting Mimetics and Chemotherapy**: [[effects_of_diet_on_aging | Caloric restriction mimetics]] (spermidine, hydroxycitrate, resveratrol) enhance the anti-cancer immune response when combined with chemotherapy, making the therapy more durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. Inhibiting [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] or removing T-cells abolishes this beneficial interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.

### Inflammation
Induction of [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] can be a subtle way to avoid excessive inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. The "sickness response" (e.g., in bacterial infection), where animals and humans avoid eating, leads to metabolic changes like ketone body production and reduced glucose levels, presumably inducing [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. These mechanisms altogether help avoid lethal excessive inflammation; force-feeding mice or increasing glucose levels during bacterial infection can make an otherwise manageable infection lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.

## Biomarkers for Autophagy
Measuring [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] in humans clinically is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   **Protein Deacetylation**: While correlated with nutrient deprivation-induced [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]], it's not a perfect proxy as some pharmacological inducers of [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] (e.g., rapamycin) do not cause deacetylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **LC3 Redistribution**: A relatively easy experimental system for measuring [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] is studying the redistribution of LC3 (and similar proteins). LC3 is diffusely distributed in the cytosol and then aggregates or redistributes towards autophagosomes and autolysosomes, acquiring a punctate distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. In humans, this can be observed in circulating white blood cells (leukocytes) using specialized cytofluorometers that capture images for image analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. This offers hope for a non-invasive, clinically relevant biomarker, but further work is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## Dr. Kroemer's Personal Practices
Dr. Guido Kroemer incorporates principles of [[diet_and_lifestyle_impact_on_longevity | diet and lifestyle impact on longevity]] into his own life:
*   **Time-Restricted Eating**: He typically eats only one meal per day when working in Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:24">[00:59:24]</a>.
*   **Dietary Choices**: His dinner often includes cheese and wine, providing spermidine and resveratrol, which he believes offer a synergistic effect on [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   **Prolonged Fasting**: He practices five-day complete fasts twice per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.
*   **Coffee Intake**: He drinks coffee, noting that its polyphenols induce [[autophagy_mechanisms_and_benefits | autophagy]] independently of caffeine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>. Heavy coffee consumption has been linked to reduced risks of most cardiovascular and [[neurodegenerative_diseases | neurodegenerative diseases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.
*   **[[impact_of_exercise_snacks_and_vigorous_intermittent_lifestyle_physical_activity_on_health | Exercise]]**: He also incorporates [[impact_of_exercise_snacks_and_vigorous_intermittent_lifestyle_physical_activity_on_health | exercise]] into his routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

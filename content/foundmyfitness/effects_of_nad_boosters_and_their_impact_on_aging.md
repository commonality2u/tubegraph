Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a crucial molecule in the body, considered by some to be as important as ATP for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:15">[13:22:15]</a>. NAD and ATP were likely among the first molecules used by life on Earth for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:44">[13:28:44]</a>. Along with amino acids, NAD and ATP are the three main molecules sensed by the body to understand its environment and adapt for survival or multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:07">[13:39:07]</a>.

## NAD Levels and Aging
[[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels go up and down depending on diet, exercise, and even the time of day]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:11">[11:17:11]</a>. They rise during the day and decrease after a large meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:01">[11:28:01]</a>. NAD cycles are also thought to contribute to jet lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:13">[11:36:13]</a>.

A significant aspect of aging is the decline in NAD levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. It is hypothesized that this decline plays a causal role in the aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. For individuals approaching 50, NAD levels may be half of what they were at age 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:26">[15:02:26]</a>. This reduction means that sirtuins, key enzymes that regulate many bodily functions, may only work half as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:07">[15:10:07]</a>.

### Effects of NAD Decline
The [[effects_of_nad_decline_with_age | decline in NAD levels with age]] can lead to:
*   Reduced benefits from exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:11">[15:16:11]</a>.
*   Increased fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:07">[15:19:07]</a>.
*   Decreased energy production and mitochondrial function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:04">[15:22:04]</a>.
*   A "positive feedback loop in a bad way" where declining NAD leads to more damage, requiring more NAD, further draining reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:18">[17:50:18]</a>.
*   Impaired immune system function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:18">[17:30:18]</a>.
*   Inefficient DNA repair (PARP activity relies on NAD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:10">[17:35:10]</a>.
*   Distraction and overwhelming of sirtuins due to accumulating DNA damage, leading to loss of cellular identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:01">[18:05:01]</a>.

## NAD Boosters: Mechanisms and Types
Raising NAD levels aims to "trick the body into thinking that it's young again, or it's been exercising, or dieting," allowing sirtuins to function optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:10">[15:29:10]</a>.

### NAD's Role in Cellular Processes
NAD is essential for:
*   Metabolism of glucose and fatty acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.
*   Mitochondrial function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:11">[13:10:11]</a>.
*   Activating sirtuins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. Sirtuins are enzymes that control gene expression and lifespan, and they require NAD to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.
*   DNA repair, especially through the PARP enzyme, which also requires NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:10">[17:35:10]</a>. Sirtuins are among the first proteins to respond to a broken chromosome, playing a direct role in DNA repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:01">[19:05:01]</a>.

NAD levels are naturally increased during a fasted state and in response to exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

### [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)]]
NAD is recycled in the body via the salvage pathway, starting with nicotinamide (a form of vitamin B3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>. Direct NAD supplementation is ineffective as it's a large molecule not easily taken up by cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>.

*   **NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide)**: This is an immediate precursor to NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:54:00">[37:54:00]</a>. When ingested, NMN is taken up by a specific transporter and converted into NAD within one step by the NAMPT enzyme, which then traps it inside the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:56:00">[37:56:00]</a>. NAMPT levels increase under stress and calorie restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:19:00">[38:19:00]</a>.
*   **NR (Nicotinamide Riboside)**: NR is a smaller version of NMN, lacking a phosphate group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>. For NR to become NAD, the body must first add a phosphate group to convert it to NMN, and then link two parts together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:04:00">[39:04:00]</a>.

Both NR and NMN have been shown to raise NAD levels in animals and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:20:00">[39:20:00]</a>.

### Resveratrol
Resveratrol, a molecule found in grapes, is produced when plants are stressed (e.g., by fungus or lack of water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:02:00">[40:02:00]</a>. When ingested, it helps activate sirtuins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:18:00">[40:18:00]</a>, acting as an "accelerator pedal" for sirtuins, while NAD is the "fuel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>. The combination of NAD boosters and resveratrol is believed to be more effective than either alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.

## Observed Effects of NAD Boosters
### Animal Studies
NAD boosters like NMN and NR have demonstrated significant effects in rodent studies:
*   **Delayed tissue aging** in multiple organs of normal mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:36:00">[59:36:00]</a>.
*   **Improved health parameters** in mice over a year of treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:00:01:00">[1:00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Extended lifespan** (ongoing NMN study, already showing significant differences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:00:07:00">[1:00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Improved frailty** and heart function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:00:23:00">[1:00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Improved memory** and slowed progression of Alzheimer's in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:02:00">[51:02:00]</a>.
*   **Improved blood flow** and regeneration of the vascular system, mimicking exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:33:00">[51:33:00]</a>. Early results also suggest restoring blood flow in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:48:00">[51:48:00]</a>.
*   In head-to-head mouse studies, NMN has been shown to increase endurance where NR did not at the same dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:45:00">[55:45:00]</a>. NMN also worked in a mitochondrial disease model where NR did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:09:00">[56:09:00]</a>.

### Human Studies and Anecdotal Evidence
[[potential_health_benefits_and_risks_of_nad_supplementation | Human clinical trials for NAD boosters]] are ongoing, with results eagerly anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:04:00">[57:04:00]</a>.
*   **Jet Lag**: Anecdotal evidence suggests that NAD boosters might help alleviate jet lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
*   **Cardiovascular Health**: Resveratrol has shown compelling effects in rhesus monkeys, completely ameliorating diet-induced aortic stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:00">[42:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:17:00">[43:17:00]</a>. Studies in mice showed resveratrol-treated mice on a high-fat diet had pristine organs and clean arteries, despite being obese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:34:00">[45:34:00]</a>.
*   **Alzheimer's Disease**: Clinical studies with resveratrol in Alzheimer's patients (500-1000 mg/day) found reductions in amyloid beta 42 in cerebral spinal fluid and improvements in cognitive function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:30:00">[48:30:00]</a>. NAD boosters have also shown promise in mouse models of Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:02:00">[51:02:00]</a>.
*   **Autophagy**: Resveratrol appears to activate autophagy, a cellular clean-up process, by decreasing protein acetylation, which is mediated by sirtuins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:32:00">[49:32:00]</a>.

Concerns exist regarding dosage and side effects in human studies. A recent study with 1,000 mg/day of NR showed no statistical significance in endpoints like endurance, and some participants experienced rashes and flushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:57:00">[53:57:00]</a>.

## Connection to Other Aging Pathways
### Sirtuins and the Role of NAD
The discovery of genes controlling aging (longevity genes) in organisms like yeast and worms led to the identification of sirtuins, enzymes that regulate gene expression and lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="5:10:00">[5:10:00]</a>. These sirtuins, found in nearly every life form on Earth, are activated by NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:34:00">[3:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. When activated, sirtuins help repair the body and slow aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:44:00">[1:44:00]</a>.

### Diet and Lifestyle
Activities like running and fasting trigger these longevity genes to repair the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:44:00">[1:44:00]</a>. Increased sirtuin activity mimics the benefits of [[effects_of_diet_on_aging | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="6:38:00">[6:38:00]</a>. Intermittent fasting also activates sirtuins without requiring constant hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="7:48:00">[7:48:00]</a>. Calorie restriction and intermittent fasting have a variety of beneficial health effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="8:09:00">[8:09:00]</a>.

### [[the_concept_of_hormesis_and_its_role_in_aging | Hormesis]]
The concept of hormesis suggests that slight stress on the body (like exercise, fasting, or consuming stressed plants) activates beneficial stress response pathways, including sirtuins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a>, leading to a fitter and more sustainable body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:38:00">[41:38:00]</a>. Conversely, constant satisfaction of hunger and sedentary lifestyles can lead to a less resilient body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[41:10:00]</a>.

### Epigenetic Clock and Age Reversal
The epigenetic clock (e.g., Horvath's methylation clock) is a measure of biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00:00">[32:00:00]</a>. This clock is intimately linked to the movement and distraction of sirtuins due to DNA damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>. Researchers believe they have identified a genetic "reset" signal that can reverse the Horvath clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>. This involves using a modified version of the Yamanaka factors (genes that can revert adult cells to primitive stem cells), which has shown promise in reversing aging in mice, including restoring eyesight and regrowing optic nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>. NAD is considered part of the "fuel" needed for this reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Directions
*   **Dosage and Efficacy**: Determining the optimal and effective dose for NAD boosters in humans is a key challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:00:43:00">[1:00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Safety**: While existing pathways like those affected by metformin and NAD boosters appear relatively safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a>, more potent age reversal methods, like epigenetic resetting, are considered "playing with fire" due to the risk of tumor formation if overdone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>.
*   **New Molecules**: Chemists are working on "super NAD boosters" that are more effective and have timed-release properties, aiming for future medicines to treat diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:32:00">[56:32:00]</a>.
*   **Clinical Trials**: Clinical trials for new NAD-boosting molecules (e.g., MIB 636) are underway to assess safety and efficacy in humans, including evaluating strength and endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:04:00">[57:04:00]</a>. Early trials are focusing on localized treatments like glaucoma to manage potential risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:32:00">[30:32:00]</a>.

## Storage of NAD Boosters
It is crucial to keep NAD boosters like NR and NMN cold (in a freezer or fridge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:55:00">[57:55:00]</a>. If left on the shelf, especially if it gets wet or humid, they can degrade into nicotinamide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:02:00">[59:02:00]</a>. High doses of nicotinamide are undesirable as they can inhibit sirtuins and interfere with DNA repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:04:00">[58:04:00]</a>.

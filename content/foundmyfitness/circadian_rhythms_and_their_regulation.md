Every living organism on Earth possesses an internal biological clock, known as the [[Circadian rhythms and their impact on health | circadian clock]] or [[Circadian rhythms and their impact on physiology | circadian rhythm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This internal timing mechanism evolved due to Earth's rotation, allowing organisms to anticipate daily changes in light and darkness, and accordingly time activities like sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Anticipating these environmental shifts is crucial for survival, such as diurnal animals knowing when to seek shelter before evening or wake up before dawn to find food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Development of Circadian Clocks

While clocks are present at birth, they are not initially wired together in babies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Newborns typically don't exhibit a 24-hour rhythm in activity or sleep, often waking every three to four hours for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. After 8 to 12 weeks, babies begin to have more consolidated sleep, but it may not be tied to the light-dark cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Around six months of age, the clocks become functional, wired properly, and linked to the light-dark cycle, allowing babies to sleep for longer periods at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## The Master Circadian Clock: Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)

The body contains a master regulator clock located in the brain, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This small part of the brain, about one millimeter by one millimeter, is composed of approximately 100,000 neurons in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The SCN is situated above the optic chiasma, where optic nerves from the eyes crisscross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

The SCN acts as the master circadian oscillator, orchestrating daily rhythms in waking and sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. It influences other organs by signaling when the body should be awake, eating, or exercising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. If the SCN is damaged, an individual loses their sense of time, leading to random sleep-wake cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This disruption is observed in conditions like advanced Alzheimer's disease dementia, where affected individuals may stay awake at night and be sleepy during the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Regulation by Light

The primary regulator of the SCN is light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. For a long time, the specific light receptor responsible for resetting the clock was unknown, as many blind people could still reset their clocks and experience jet lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. However, individuals who have had both eyes removed cannot reset their clocks, indicating the receptor is in the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Around 16 years ago, a new light-sensing molecule called **melanopsin** was discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Melanopsin is found in a small number (2,000 to 5,000) of special light-sensitive ganglion cells in the human retina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. These cells primarily sense light in the blue spectrum and send this information directly to the SCN, signaling when it's morning and time to sync up the [[light and circadian rhythms | clock]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

Melanopsin is less sensitive to light than other photoreceptors like rhodopsin, requiring a significant amount of bright light (around 1000 lux) to fully activate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. It also integrates light over time, meaning it "remembers" previous light exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This characteristic ensures that only sustained bright light, typical of daytime, can fully activate it and reset the clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

Beyond resetting the SCN, melanopsin also connects to brain regions that regulate sleep, explaining why it's hard to sleep in a lighted room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. It also indirectly suppresses melatonin production, the sleep hormone, which helps us stay awake and alert in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

The quality and amount of light received throughout the day are crucial for [[light_exposure_and_its_effects_on_circadian_rhythms | circadian rhythm]] regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Bright, blue-shifted light in the first half of the day can promote alertness and reduce depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Conversely, minimal light in the evening is ideal for good sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Spending over 90% of time indoors, where light levels are often below 1000 lux, can confuse the body's internal clock about the true time of day, leading to desynchronized [[Circadian rhythms and their impact on physiology | circadian rhythms]] and gene expression in various organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

Cortisol, a stress hormone, is also regulated by the [[Circadian rhythms and their impact on physiology | circadian clock]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. It typically peaks when we wake up to promote alertness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Studies suggest that bright light exposure in the morning can help regulate cortisol levels, preventing them from being excessively high at inappropriate times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

## Peripheral Clocks and Regulation by Food

Beyond the master clock in the brain, almost every organ in the body contains its own clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These peripheral clocks help organs reach peak performance at specific times and then rest and rejuvenate at other times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. While the SCN is primarily regulated by light, these peripheral clocks, such as those in the liver, muscle, and gut, are largely regulated by the timing of food intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

Research shows that the liver's genetic expression (3,000 to 5,000 genes cycling daily) takes its cue from when food is eaten, rather than solely from the light-dark cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. This means that if mice are fed during the day (their normal sleep period), their liver clocks adjust to the feeding time, regardless of the light-dark cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. This highlights that the first sight of bright light and the first bite of food are crucial determinants of how our body clocks function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

Just as a traffic light system manages downtown traffic, these organ clocks coordinate metabolic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. When clocks are disrupted, it can lead to metabolic inefficiencies, byproduct accumulation, and cellular stress, contributing to disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

## Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF)

Time-restricted feeding (TRF) involves consuming all daily food within a specific window of time, typically 8 to 12 hours, followed by a prolonged fasting period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. Unlike calorie restriction or traditional intermittent fasting, TRF does not necessarily restrict calorie intake, although it can lead to it indirectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

### Benefits in Animal Models

Experiments in mice have demonstrated significant benefits of TRF, even on unhealthy diets:
*   **Obesity and Diabetes:** Mice fed a high-fat diet freely became obese and diabetic. However, mice given the exact same high-fat diet and calories, but restricted to an 8-12 hour feeding window during their active period, did not become obese or diabetic and maintained normal liver function and cholesterol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. They showed 28% less total body mass and 70% less fat mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>.
*   **Muscle Mass and Endurance:** Even on a standard healthy diet, mice on TRF (8-12 hours) experienced increased muscle mass and decreased fat mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>. A 9-hour feeding window specifically improved endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
*   **Mitochondrial Health:** The endurance benefits correlate with increased mitochondrial volume and less damaged mitochondria in the liver and brown adipose tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>. TRF may boost NAD levels, which are precursors to cellular energy currency (ATP), and are linked to maintaining muscle mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   **Heart Health:** In fruit flies, 12-hour TRF prevented age-related heart arrhythmia and heart conditions induced by high-fat diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>. It also improved heart rate variability and reduced reactive oxygen species production in heart cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>.
*   **Sleep:** TRF in flies prevented fragmented sleep in older age, leading to better sleep at night and increased daytime activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.

### The Role of Melatonin and Insulin Sensitivity

[[Circadian rhythm and its role in health and metabolism | Insulin sensitivity]] is known to be lower at the end of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. Recent research suggests that melatonin plays a role in this, as melatonin receptors are present in pancreatic beta cells and inhibit insulin secretion when engaged with melatonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. This implies that late-night eating, when melatonin levels are naturally higher due to less light exposure, may have a different metabolic effect than eating the same calories earlier in the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.

### Impact on Gut Microbiome

The [[impact of circadian rhythms on gut microbiome and metabolism | gut microbiome]] also follows circadian rhythms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>. TRF promotes diversity within the gut microbiome by creating alternating environments (feeding vs. fasting) that favor different bacterial species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>. This diversity is associated with better health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:32">[01:23:32]</a>. TRF has also been shown to improve bile acid management, which are made from cholesterol in the liver and play a role in fat absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>.

## Circadian Disruption and Health

Modern society, with its artificial light and 24-hour schedules, has tremendously disrupted the natural day and night cycle that humans evolved with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>. This widespread [[effects of circadian rhythms on metabolism and disease | circadian disruption]] is linked to chronic diseases, which account for five or six of the top ten causes of death in industrialized countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

Shift workers, who frequently change their work schedules, experience chronic jet lag, making them highly susceptible to metabolic diseases and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. They often remain in dim, indoor environments, further disrupting their internal clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Managing [[light_exposure_and_its_effects_on_circadian_rhythms | light exposure]] and [[circadian_rhythm_and_meal_timing | meal timing]] is crucial for their health and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

## MyCircadianClock App

To understand and address circadian disruption in humans, the myCircadianClock.org initiative developed a smartphone app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. The app allows users to document their eating patterns by simply taking pictures of their food, which automatically records timestamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. Initial studies found that nearly 50% of people eat over a 15-hour period daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.

When participants who typically ate for 14 hours or longer were asked to restrict their eating to a 10-11 hour window, they self-selected their eating times and adhered to the schedule for 16 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. While not explicitly asked to reduce calories, they experienced an average of 3.8% body weight loss, primarily due to reducing late-night snacks, desserts, and alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. Participants also reported improved sleep and increased energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>.

The app also integrates with health data platforms like HealthKit (iPhone) and Google Fit (Android) to collect information on activity, sleep, and other health parameters, aiming to build a comprehensive picture of lifestyle for circadian rhythm research and public health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>. This data can help researchers understand daily patterns in the general public and guide future interventions to prevent chronic diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.

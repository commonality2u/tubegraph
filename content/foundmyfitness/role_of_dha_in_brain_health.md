Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential [[importance_of_omega3_fatty_acids_for_health | omega-3 fatty acid]] that plays a critical role in human physiology, particularly within the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The human body cannot produce DHA, so it must be obtained through diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## General Benefits of Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Supplementation with DHA, alongside eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), has been associated with several health benefits, some of which directly impact the brain:
*   **Delaying Brain Aging and Atrophy** [[omega3_fatty_acids_and_brain_health | Omega-3 fatty acids]] have been shown to delay brain aging by assisting the brain in repairing damage and slowing brain atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Cell Membrane Fluidity** They are crucial for cell membrane fluidity, which is vital for neurons, as the proper function of neurotransmitters like norepinephrine (involved in focus and attention) depends on this fluidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## DHA's Abundance and Preferred Form in the Brain

DHA is the most abundant fatty acid in the brain, constituting between 10% to 20% of the brain's total lipid composition, which makes up about 60% of its dry weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The brain preferentially utilizes DHA lysophosphatidylcholine as its source of DHA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This molecule is a byproduct of DHA in phosphatidylcholine after being cleaved by lipases in the intestine or bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Studies in developing rats and piglets have shown that DHA lysophosphatidylcholine accumulates in the brain at tenfold higher amounts compared to DHA in free fatty acid form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Transport Mechanism into the Brain

A specialized DHA transporter, known as **MFSD2A**, is responsible for transporting DHA lysophosphatidylcholine across the blood-brain barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Mice engineered to lack this transporter had 60% less DHA in their brains compared to control mice, indicating its critical role in brain DHA uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This specific transporter only affects DHA levels in the brain, not in other organs like the heart or liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Red blood cells also show a preference for DHA lysophosphatidylcholine, and their DHA concentration correlates tightly with actual DHA levels in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## DHA Sources and Brain Health

Krill oil is considered a superior source of DHA for the brain because it is rich in phosphatidylcholine, which implies it would also be a good source of DHA lysophosphatidylcholine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. In contrast, fish oil typically does not contain DHA in this preferred form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Related Phospholipids and Neurodegenerative Diseases

Beyond DHA, krill oil also provides other important phospholipids like phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. These accumulate in both mitochondrial and cell membranes, and their concentration has been observed to decrease with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This decrease in concentration has been implicated in the development of [[magnesiums_impact_on_brain_health_and_aging | neurodegenerative diseases]] such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), specifically atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), is the leading cause of death in the United States and globally for both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. A sobering statistic reveals that a little less than 50% of people's first symptom of coronary artery disease is sudden death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. In medical school, when asked the most common presenting feature for cardiovascular disease, the answer was "sudden death," not typical symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Understanding Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)

ASCVD primarily refers to the disease of coronary arteries that leads to ischemia (reduced blood flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This involves plaque formation inside coronary arteries, which can be understood more clearly than other chronic diseases like cancer or neurodegenerative diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Plaque formation, driven by endothelial injury, lipoprotein burden, and inflammation, reduces blood flow to the heart muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. An acute event can compromise enough heart muscle to result in sudden death, or a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Atherosclerosis is a disease that takes decades to progress, often beginning at birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

## Key Causal Risk Factors

Four major causal factors for ASCVD are:
*   Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>
*   Insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>
*   Hypertension (high blood pressure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>
*   Smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>

### Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)

Cholesterol is essential for life, forming cell membranes and acting as a precursor to vital hormones like testosterone and estrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. To transport water-insoluble cholesterol through the blood, it's wrapped in lipoproteins, with ApoB being a key protein on their surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. ApoB is the structural apoprotein on low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

**Measurement of ApoB:**
While total cholesterol was initially measured, then LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), it's now understood that measuring ApoB provides a better prediction of heart disease risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. ApoB, measured in milligrams per deciliter, represents the concentration of all particles capable of initiating and progressing atherosclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

Historically, LDL-C was often estimated using the Friedewald equation, which can be inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Directly measured LDL-C is better, but still inferior to ApoB as a risk predictor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. LDL particle number (LDL-P), measured by NMR, has also been shown to predict risk better than LDL-C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. However, ApoB is considered superior because it encompasses the total atherogenic burden, including VLDL and IDL particles, which LDL-P or LDL-C might miss, especially in cases of high VLDL or small dense LDL particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

**Optimal ApoB Levels:**
Reference ranges for ApoB are population-based, but a philosophy on ApoB, considering its causal link to ASCVD, suggests aiming to eliminate it as a risk factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. The analogy used is with smoking and lung cancer: if something causes a disease, it should be eliminated, not merely managed to a certain percentile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

ApoB levels rise with age, primarily due to changes in clearance rather than increased synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. Children are typically born with ApoB levels below 20 mg/dL, which are considered physiologic levels (10-30 mg/dL) with no negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. According to Dr. Peter Libby, an ApoB level below 20-30 mg/dL would make it impossible to develop atherosclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. A lifetime ceiling of 60 mg/dL would also be very low-risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.

**Factors Affecting ApoB:**
*   **Insulin Resistance**: Contributes to higher ApoB levels, mostly through the VLDL triglyceride pathway. Higher triglyceride burden leads to higher ApoB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. Managing insulin resistance is key to keeping ApoB in check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. Carbohydrate restriction (refined and starchy carbs) is effective for triglyceride reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.
*   **Saturated Fat Consumption**: Directly impacts cholesterol synthesis and inhibits sterol regulatory binding protein in the liver, leading to fewer LDL receptors and thus higher ApoB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. Susceptibility to this varies individually due to genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>. Swapping saturated fat with monounsaturated fat can often fix the problem for those who hyper-respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.

### Insulin Resistance and Glucose Levels

Elevated glucose levels are toxic to small vessels (eyes, kidneys, microvasculature of heart and brain), while elevated insulin levels are damaging to large blood vessels (aorta, iliac, carotid arteries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:12">[01:45:12]</a>. Postprandial hyperinsulinemia (high insulin after meals) is a harbinger of metabolic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.

### Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)

Blood pressure is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is highly amenable to lifestyle interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:16">[03:30:16]</a>. Target blood pressure is 120/80 or better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:46">[03:29:46]</a>.

### Smoking

Smoking is the number one modifiable risk factor for cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:55">[02:08:55]</a> and also a causal factor for ASCVD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

## Prevention Strategies

### Lifestyle Interventions

*   **Diet**: Focused on energy balance and adequate protein intake (e.g., 40-50 grams four times a day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:53">[03:46:53]</a>. Avoiding junk food is a primary rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:25">[03:46:25]</a>. Eating at least 3 hours before bed helps with sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:26">[03:47:26]</a>.
*   **[[Exercise and heart health | Exercise]]**: Crucial for increasing insulin sensitivity and overall health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:13">[01:46:13]</a>.
    *   **Zone 2 Training**: Key for expanding the capacity of mitochondria to utilize fatty acids for oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:53">[02:05:53]</a>. It's the training system for metabolic flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:40">[01:52:40]</a>. This involves exercising at an intensity where you can speak but it's uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.
    *   **VO2 Max Training**: Increases mitochondrial biogenesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:22">[01:53:22]</a>. High-level endurance athletes, like cross-country skiers, distance runners, and cyclists, have the highest VO2 Maxes and are the most metabolically flexible humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>.
    *   **Training Ratio**: Aim for an 80/20 split between Zone 2 and V2 Max training to build a strong aerobic base and peak performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:21">[01:56:21]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Acute and chronic sleep disruptions impair glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:26">[01:46:26]</a>. Achieving 7.5 hours of sleep with consistent bedtime and wake-up times is ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:45">[03:43:45]</a>. Avoiding activating stimuli like emails or social media before bed is helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:22">[03:44:22]</a>.
*   **Stress Management**: Hypercortisolemia (high cortisol) can contribute to insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:53">[02:11:53]</a>. Exercise and good sleep help balance this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:59">[02:11:59]</a>. Therapy and journaling can also improve distress tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:08">[03:50:08]</a>.

### Pharmacological Interventions

*   **Statins**: Inhibit cholesterol synthesis, primarily in the liver, leading to increased LDL receptors and reduced LDL in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.
    *   **Side Effects**: Muscle aches (about 7% of people, reversible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>, insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes (about 4% of people, should be monitored) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>, and increased liver function tests (transaminases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>.
    *   **Mitochondrial Function**: While statins affect the HMG-CoA pathway (involved in CoQ10 synthesis), their impact on mitochondrial function (as measured by Zone 2 testing with lactate) appears to be very small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>. Supplementing CoQ10 is not definitively shown to offset muscle soreness, but there's no harm in taking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Brain Impact**: No study has had Alzheimer's or dementia as a primary outcome for statin use. Secondary outcome analyses generally show neutral to beneficial effects of statins on dementia/Alzheimer's incidence, with no difference between hydrophobic and hydrophilic statins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>. However, very low desmosterol levels (a proxy for brain cholesterol synthesis) might increase AD risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.
*   **Ezetimibe (Zetia)**: Increases LDL receptors by impairing cholesterol reabsorption in the gut, blocking the Neiman-Pick C1 transporter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a>. Effective in patients with defective ATP-binding cassettes (measured by high phytosterol levels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>. Phytosterols can be more atherogenic than cholesterol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>.
*   **PCSK9 Inhibitors**: Derived from genetic observations, these drugs target a protein that degrades LDL receptors, leading to significantly lower LDL/ApoB levels with minimal side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>. They are expensive and typically only covered for high-risk patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>.
*   **Bempedoic Acid**: A prodrug that inhibits cholesterol synthesis *only* in the liver, leading to increased LDL receptors without systemic side effects like muscle aches or diabetes risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>. Also expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:54">[01:28:54]</a>.
*   **Supplements**:
    *   **Berberine**: An analog of metformin, it's a complex one inhibitor that has shown promise in systematic reviews for lowering LDL cholesterol and potentially particle number, and may reduce statin myopathy and effective statin dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>.
    *   **Cocoa Flavanols**: Can help lower blood pressure by promoting nitric oxide synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:03">[03:36:03]</a>.
    *   **B Vitamins and Magnesium**: Can help lower homocysteine, which otherwise impairs nitric oxide synthesis and is associated with poor [[atherogenic_dyslipidemia_and_heart_disease_risk | cardiovascular outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:01">[03:35:01]</a>.

## Screening and Monitoring

*   **CT Angiogram (CTA)**: Can provide a clear picture of plaque accumulation in arteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:23">[01:29:23]</a>. Useful for assessing plaque presence (calcification and soft plaque) to guide treatment aggressiveness, especially in middle-aged individuals or older individuals with unusual family history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:09">[01:33:09]</a>. Radiation exposure for CTAs has significantly decreased over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:51">[03:34:51]</a>.
*   **Blood Pressure Monitoring**: At-home automated cuffs are recommended. Proper measurement technique involves sitting for 5 minutes without stimulation, then taking two more readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:31">[03:36:31]</a>.
*   **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)**: Can track average blood glucose, postprandial spikes, and variability. Lower average blood glucose is associated with better all-cause mortality outcomes, even within the non-diabetic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:09">[01:50:09]</a>.
*   **Other Blood Markers**:
    *   **Desmosterol and Lathosterol**: Desmosterol is a proxy for brain cholesterol synthesis, while lathosterol indicates peripheral cholesterol synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. Very low desmosterol levels are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.
    *   **Phytosterols (Cytostanol, Campesterol)**: Indicate plant sterol absorption. High levels can be more atherogenic than cholesterol and suggest a defective ATP-binding cassette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:14">[01:25:14]</a>. Using phytosterols to lower cholesterol is generally not favored due to the risk of raising atherogenic phytosterols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>.
    *   **Homocysteine, ADMA, SDMA**: Elevated homocysteine impairs clearance of asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA and SDMA), which directly inhibit nitric oxide synthase, leading to impaired blood vessel function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:50">[03:35:50]</a>.

## Hormonal Influence

### Menopause and Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)

Menopause involves a rapid decline in estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:15">[02:38:15]</a>. This leads to vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats), brain fog, sleep disturbances, and sexual changes (vaginal atrophy, reduced libido) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>.

A major consequence is bone destruction; women experience a sharp decline in bone mineral density post-menopause, unlike men's gradual decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:26">[02:41:26]</a>. This increases the risk of falls and fractures later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:53">[02:41:53]</a>.

HRT is largely justified by these symptoms and the prevention of bone density loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:18">[02:42:18]</a>. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study (2001-2002) was widely misinterpreted by the media, causing significant disservice to women who were led to believe HRT increased breast cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:40">[02:42:40]</a>. The study found a statistically significant but clinically insignificant 0.1% higher risk of breast cancer in women taking conjugated equine estrogen and synthetic progestin (MPA), but no difference in breast cancer mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:13">[02:46:13]</a>. Estrogen alone was associated with a *lower* breast cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:58">[02:47:58]</a>, suggesting MPA was the problematic component, which is rarely used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:50">[02:48:50]</a>.

**Current HRT Practices:**
*   **Estrogen**: Bioidentical estradiol (E2) is preferred, typically via transdermal patches to avoid issues with oral estrogen (like hypercoagulability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:51">[02:52:51]</a>. Doses are low, aiming to keep FSH around 25-35, which is lower than pre-menopausal levels but sufficient to manage symptoms and preserve bone density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:05">[02:58:05]</a>.
*   **Progesterone**: Micronized oral progesterone or a progesterone-coated IUD is used in women with a uterus to prevent endometrial hyperplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:02">[02:49:02]</a>.
*   **Testosterone**: Important for libido, orgasmic function, arousal, and maintaining muscle mass in women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Doses are very low (about 1/10th of men's replacement dose) and aim to restore physiological levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:17">[03:15:17]</a>.

**HRT and Other Disease Risks:**
*   **Heart Disease**: Initiating HRT at menopause does not increase, and clearly reduces, a woman's risk of heart disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:11">[03:01:11]</a>.
*   **Alzheimer's Disease**: Late initiation of HRT may increase AD risk. Early initiation (at menopause) may be beneficial, especially for women with APOE4 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:14">[02:59:14]</a>.
*   **Cancer**: HRT is protective or neutral on cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:16">[03:01:16]</a>.
*   **Bone Mineral Density (BMD)**: Estrogen is crucial for BMD. Stopping estrogen leads to a rapid decline in bone density, but HRT still provides a higher baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:57">[03:01:57]</a>. Resistance training and high-impact activities (like jump roping) are also important for bone health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:01">[03:06:01]</a>. Avoiding vitamin D deficiency (aiming for 30-40 ng/mL, possibly higher) may also support bone health due to cross-talk with estrogen at the gene level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:27">[03:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:21">[03:12:21]</a>.

### Male Hormones and Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)

Male testosterone levels peak in the 20s and then experience a slow, steady decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:41">[03:20:41]</a>. Low testosterone (low-T) is defined by a combination of levels and symptoms, as androgen receptor density and function vary among men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:10">[03:21:10]</a>. Symptoms include reduced libido, energy, mood, and difficulty with muscle gain and recovery from [[exercise_and_heart_health | exercise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:21">[03:23:21]</a>.

**TRT Administration:**
Injections are generally preferred over gels due to more consistent absorption. Administering smaller doses twice a week (e.g., 40-50 mg twice a week for a total of 80-100 mg/week) maintains steadier levels than bi-weekly injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:40">[03:25:40]</a>. Target free testosterone levels might be in the 20-25 ng/dL range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:51">[03:24:51]</a>.

**TRT and Prostate:**
Contrary to popular belief, TRT does not increase the risk of prostate cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:08">[03:27:08]</a>. Lower testosterone levels are associated with higher risk of high-grade prostate cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:10">[03:27:10]</a>. However, TRT can potentially increase the size of the prostate (benign prostatic hypertrophy - BPH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:23">[03:27:23]</a>.

**Other Side Effects:**
TRT can drive hair loss and acne in susceptible individuals, though these are more common with supraphysiologic doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:32">[03:27:32]</a>. In the short term, there might be a slight increase in cardiovascular events, possibly due to increased blood pressure, which tends to normalize after 2-3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:49">[03:28:49]</a>. It is advised to ensure blood pressure is well-managed before initiating TRT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:32">[03:29:32]</a>.

## Overall Philosophy: Medicine 3.0

Medicine 3.0 emphasizes highly preventive, super early, and personalized care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:14">[03:42:14]</a>. This approach encourages individuals to be thoughtful consumers of their own healthcare information and proactively seek advanced testing and expert guidance.

Sulforaphane, a potent naturally occurring dietary activator of the NRF2 genetic pathway, shows promise in affecting brain health and potentially mitigating neurodegenerative diseases. The NRF2 pathway regulates over 200 different genes, many of which are antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and are involved in deactivating potentially harmful compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Sulforaphane's Role in Brain Health
[[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | Sulforaphane]] has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. It exhibits potent effects on lowering [[impact_of_sulforaphane_on_inflammation_and_chronic_diseases | inflammation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>. Since [[impact_of_diet_on_aging_and_brain_function | inflammation]] and oxidative stress are known to be part of the etiology of various brain conditions, [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]]'s role is particularly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. The NRF2 pathway is the body's strongest defense against oxidative stress, and oxidative stress itself activates this pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

### Autism Spectrum Disorder
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] extracted from broccoli sprouts improved autistic behavior checklist scores by 34% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. Doses ranged from approximately 9 mg to 25 mg (equivalent to about 65 grams of fresh broccoli sprouts on the high end) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. This treatment significantly improved social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication in young men with autism spectrum disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.

### Schizophrenia
Another trial found that supplementing with 30 mg per day of glucoraphanin (the precursor to [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]]) for eight weeks was effective in improving certain scores of cognitive impairment in a small group of medicated patients with schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. Schizophrenia, like autism, appears to have an oxidative stress component, which may even indicate the acute severity of symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

### Depression
Mounting evidence suggests that nutrition plays a significant role in depression, impacting neurotransmitter production and function, and affecting systemic [[impact_of_sulforaphane_on_inflammation_and_chronic_diseases | inflammation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. [[impact_of_diet_on_aging_and_brain_function | Inflammation]] is now known to play a major role in depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. Pro-inflammatory cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier and disrupt neurotransmitter production and release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.

[[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | Sulforaphane]] has been shown in mice to inhibit NF kappa-b, a master regulator of the pro-inflammatory response, through the activation of NRF2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. In animal studies, mice given lipopolysaccharide to induce an inflammatory response experienced depressive symptoms, which were reversed by administering 1 mg per kilogram of body weight of [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. NRF2 may be a target for novel antidepressant drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

Furthermore, in ten different models of stress-induced depression, [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] alleviated depressive symptoms and anxiety, similar to the antidepressant Prozac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. It also decreased stress hormones and the inflammatory response to various social stressors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. Administration of glucoraphanin during early development and adolescence prevented social defeat-induced avoidance behavior during adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.

### Neurodegenerative Diseases
[[impact_of_diet_on_neurodegenerative_and_autoimmune_diseases | Neurodegenerative diseases]] such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease are often considered diseases of [[impact_of_diet_on_aging_and_brain_function | aging]], and brain [[impact_of_sulforaphane_on_inflammation_and_chronic_diseases | inflammation]] and reactive oxygen species are hallmarks of these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. [[impact_of_sulforaphane_on_inflammation_and_chronic_diseases | Inflammation]] and high oxidative stress contribute to abnormal protein aggregates in the brain, a common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.

Injection of [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] has been shown to:
*   Improve spatial working memory and short-term memory in mice injected with amyloid beta aggregates (to induce an Alzheimer's-like disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.
*   Decrease tremors and normalize dopamine levels in mice given a chemical that induces Parkinson's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.
*   Clear aggregates from the brains of genetically engineered mice with Huntington's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

As one of the most potent inducers of the cellular antioxidant and anti-inflammatory network through NRF2 activation, [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] prevents the death of neurons and improves pathologies associated with [[impact_of_diet_on_neurodegenerative_and_autoimmune_diseases | neurodegenerative diseases]] in animal brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

### Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
Chronic [[impact_of_sulforaphane_on_inflammation_and_chronic_diseases | inflammation]] plays a major role in the later outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. Several studies show that [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] can protect against TBI in animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   When administered via injection following TBI, [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] attenuates blood-brain barrier permeability and reduces cerebral edema, regardless of how soon it was given after injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.
*   Enhanced learning and working memory were improved, but only if [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] was administered within one hour post-injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   Administration of [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] 15 minutes after the onset of ischemia (lack of oxygen in the brain) caused a reduction in infarct volume three days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Brain Protection
### Heat Shock Proteins
[[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | Sulforaphane]] activates many heat shock proteins by increasing levels of heat shock factor one (HSF1), a major regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. The induction of heat shock proteins may be an additional mechanism against protein aggregation, which has been shown to confer protection against Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>.

### Neurotrophic Growth Factors
NRF2 is key for growing new neurons, largely regulated by growth factors that promote neuronal growth and survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. High levels of [[impact_of_sulforaphane_on_inflammation_and_chronic_diseases | inflammation]] and oxidative stress, which NRF2 counters, negatively affect the production of neurotrophic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.
*   Rats with diabetes have reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), which has been experimentally reversed by [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
*   Mice with NRF2 deleted show a 30% reduction in BDNF in the hippocampus, a 30% reduction in the growth of new synapses, and a 38% reduction in neuroplasticity in the hippocampus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.

## Summary of Brain Health Benefits
In summary, a broccoli sprout beverage was able to improve behavioral scores in people with autism and cognition in a small trial of people with schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. Early animal research suggests [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] holds promise in treating other brain disorders, including depression and [[impact_of_diet_on_neurodegenerative_and_autoimmune_diseases | neurodegenerative diseases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. The potent activation of the NRF2 pathway by [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] is relevant for mitigating [[impact_of_sulforaphane_on_inflammation_and_chronic_diseases | inflammation]] and slowing [[impact_of_diet_on_aging_and_brain_function | diseases of aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>.

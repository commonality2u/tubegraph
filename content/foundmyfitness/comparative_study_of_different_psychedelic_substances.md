Dr. Roland Griffiths, a clinical pharmacologist at Johns Hopkins University, has conducted extensive research on various mind-altering substances, including classic psychedelics, ketamine, and salvinorin A. His work focuses on their effects on behavior, brain function, and potential therapeutic applications, particularly noting their distinct phenomenologies and mechanisms of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Classic Psychedelics

Classic psychedelics, such as LSD, psilocybin (from "magic mushrooms"), DMT, and mescaline, are described as serotonergically-mediated classic hallucinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:33">[01:54:33]</a>. Research suggests these substances can induce profound and enduring [[mystical_experiences_induced_by_psychedelic_therapies | mystical-type experiences]] and have shown [[potential_therapeutic_applications_of_psilocybin_beyond_cancer_treatment | therapeutic potential]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:30">[04:02:30]</a>.

### Psilocybin

Psilocybin is a primary focus of Dr. Griffiths' research.

**Effects and Phenomenology:**
Under carefully controlled conditions, psilocybin induces experiences that are deeply and profoundly personally and spiritually meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. These experiences are highly valued by individuals long after the session concludes, often being described as among the most significant of their lives, comparable to major life events like the birth of a child or the death of a parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>.

Key features of these psilocybin-induced mystical-type experiences include:
*   A sense of the interconnectedness of all people and things (unity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:13">[07:53:13]</a>.
*   Feelings of sacredness, reverence, and humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:18">[08:04:18]</a>.
*   A profound sense of authenticity and truth, sometimes described as "more real and more true than everyday waking consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:48">[08:14:48]</a>.
*   Positive moods, including love or "heart opening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:02">[08:31:02]</a>.
*   Transcendence of time and space, where past and future collapse into the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:05">[08:37:05]</a>.
*   Ineffability, meaning the experiences are difficult or impossible to put into words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:48">[08:44:48]</a>.

These experiences often lead to "reorganizational" changes in how individuals perceive themselves and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:08">[09:13:08]</a>. People report thinking about the experience daily, even months or years later, and it affects their belief systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:47">[09:16:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:19">[37:51:19]</a>. There are also enduring changes in personality, specifically an increase in "openness," which personality theorists typically suggest does not happen after mid-20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:01">[38:45:01]</a>.

**Mechanism of Action:**
Psilocybin primarily binds to serotonin 2A and 2C receptors, with effects largely mediated through 2A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:07">[22:48:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:06">[26:27:06]</a>. Current hypotheses suggest that the major effects are downstream and likely glutamate-mediated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:33">[23:10:33]</a>. Acutely, psilocybin appears to decrease activity within the default mode network (DMN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:49">[26:56:49]</a>. The DMN is associated with rumination and self-referential processing, which are often increased in depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:32">[27:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:24">[27:24:24]</a>. Decreased DMN activity is also observed in long-term meditators, drawing parallels between psilocybin and meditation practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:41">[28:24:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:48:10">[28:48:10]</a>.

**Therapeutic Applications:**
Recent studies have shown promising results for psilocybin in treating:
*   [[Psilocybin and its effects on depression and anxiety in cancer patients | Depression and anxiety in late-stage cancer patients]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. A study co-published by Johns Hopkins and NYU found large and sustained decreases in anxiety and depression, with effects lasting at least five weeks, and no significant relapse rate observed out to six months after a single treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:03">[00:15:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:20">[16:22:20]</a>.
*   Treatment-resistant depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:21">[19:29:21]</a>.
*   Cigarette smoking cessation, with a pilot study showing an 80% abstinence rate at six months when psilocybin was embedded in cognitive behavioral therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:39">[40:11:39]</a>.
*   [[potential_therapeutic_applications_of_psilocybin_beyond_cancer_treatment | Other potential applications]] include alcoholism, cocaine dependence, PTSD, OCD, and eating disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:48">[41:10:48]</a>. The intervention may also be relevant for end-of-life care generally, addressing existential anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:31:02">[43:31:02]</a>.

**Administration and Risks:**
*   Psilocybin is administered as a synthesized capsule, not mushrooms, in a controlled therapeutic environment with preparation and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:47">[05:48:47]</a>.
*   Effects are dose-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:49:15">[48:49:15]</a>.
*   Risks include immediate dangers such as putting oneself or others at risk of physical harm (reported by ~10% in a survey study) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:24:43">[46:24:43]</a> and enduring psychological problems (some seeking help a year later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:43:10">[46:43:10]</a>. These risks are higher when individuals take psilocybin without proper knowledge, support, or dose control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:10:47">[47:10:47]</a>.
*   Individuals with a pre-existing vulnerability to psychotic or bipolar disorder are excluded from studies due to potential risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:35:05">[47:35:05]</a>.
*   Despite careful selection and support, about 30% of volunteers may experience challenging periods of significant fear or anxiety, but these often resolve or lead to insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:34:49">[50:34:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:54:19">[50:54:19]</a>.

**Historical and Cultural Context:**
[[Psychedelic research and historical context | Research on classic hallucinogens]] largely ceased in the late 1960s due to the psychedelic movement and cultural reactivity, which led to these drugs being placed into Schedule I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>. This created a period of several decades with no clinical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>.
Historically, psilocybin has been used for hundreds of years in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>, and various psilocybin mushroom species have been used around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>. Indigenous use typically occurs in a highly controlled cultural context, primarily for religious, healing, or divination purposes, rather than casually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.

### Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and Ayahuasca

DMT is a very short-acting classic hallucinogen of the serotonin type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>. Its phenomenology is distinct from salvinorin A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.
Ayahuasca, a brew primarily consumed in South America, combines DMT with an MAO inhibitor. This combination slows down DMT's metabolism, increasing its duration of action and making its effects more similar to psilocybin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>. Ayahuasca, like psilocybin, has also been used for centuries by indigenous populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:18">[01:12:18]</a>.

## Ketamine

Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic, but phenomenologically, it is sometimes considered a psychedelic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:39">[02:44:39]</a>. Its mechanism of action and pharmacology are entirely different from classic hallucinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:39">[02:44:39]</a>. However, both ketamine and classic hallucinogens may share common downstream effects on the glutamate system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:56">[02:53:56]</a>.
Ketamine has been shown to have very significant, immediate, but short-lived antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. Whether its subjective effects are necessary for antidepressant outcomes is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:18">[02:58:18]</a>.

## Salvinorin A

Salvinorin A is a kappa-opioid receptor agonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>. It produces dissociative effects and is classified as a short-acting hallucinogen, but its phenomenology is very different from classic hallucinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.
*   **Effects:** People generally do not report mystical experiences with salvinorin A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>. They may experience a profound altered reality, sometimes with other entities present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. The experience is generally not enjoyed, which is consistent with the dysphoric properties of dynorphin, an endogenous opioid that also binds to kappa-opioid receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>.
*   **Duration:** The effects of inhaled salvinorin A are very short-lived, typically less than 10 minutes, with individuals returning to baseline within 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.
*   **Reorganizational Meaning:** Unlike classic hallucinogens, salvinorin A does not appear to induce the same kind of reorganizational meaning for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>.

## Contextual Influence on Experience

The "set" (expectations and mindset) and "setting" (environment) under which a psychedelic substance is taken profoundly affect the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:19">[05:54:19]</a>. While expectation can drive some aspects of the experience, it does not fully account for the effects of psilocybin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:11">[05:59:11]</a>. In controlled settings with support, even challenging experiences can be navigated and contribute to the overall meaningfulness for individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

> "This is not just an effective of psilocybin. And in fact, there are risks associated with just taking psilocybin that we really shouldn't minimize." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>

Research into the neuroplastic changes underlying these profound experiences is ongoing, as they represent a unique model for studying consciousness and human transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:55">[03:54:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.

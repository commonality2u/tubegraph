Dr. Dale Bredesen, an internationally recognized expert in neurodegenerative disease, particularly [[Alzheimers disease and insulin resistance | Alzheimer's disease]], highlights that the condition is the most common cause of cognitive decline leading to dementia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>. While defined by amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau tangles, these are markers, not necessarily the root causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. The understanding of [[Alzheimers disease and insulin resistance | Alzheimer's]] is currently undergoing a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Amyloid Beta: A Dual Role

For years, amyloid has been "vilified" as a neurotoxin with toxic effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. However, it is also a protectant, produced by the brain in response to specific insults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Research indicates it functions as an antimicrobial, as shown by Professor Rudy Tanzi and Professor Robert Moir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. It also binds divalent metals like copper, zinc, and iron, as Professor Ashley Bush demonstrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Dr. Bredesen's own research showed it's a response to reduced trophic support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:07]</a>.

The brain produces amyloid in response to various insults and metabolic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. While its production increases the risk of degeneration, many individuals produce it without experiencing downsizing or cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Those who experience [[Role of inflammation in aging | inflammation]] on top of amyloid production tend to fare worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## The 36 Factors and Alzheimer's Subtypes

Dr. Bredesen's research has identified 36 contributing factors to [[Alzheimers disease and insulin resistance | Alzheimer's]], which fall into several categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. He categorizes [[Alzheimers disease and insulin resistance | Alzheimer's disease]] into several subtypes based on these underlying factors:

### Type 1: Inflammatory or "Hot" Alzheimer's
This type is characterized by [[Inflammation and inflammaging | inflammation]] caused by factors like pathogens (e.g., P. gingivalis, Borrelia of Lyme disease, fungi), or issues like leaky gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Amyloid is seen as a "napalm" response to "bad guys" (pathogens), which, while protective, also leads to the "downsizing" of the brain's neural network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

### Type 2: Atrophic or "Cold" Alzheimer's
This subtype involves decreased trophic support, meaning insufficient support for synaptogenesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. Critical factors for synaptic support include nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), estradiol, testosterone, pregnenolone, progesterone, thyroid hormones, and vitamin D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. This leads to a shift in the ratio of synaptoblastic (making synapses) to synaptoclastic (pulling back/reorganizing synapses) activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

### Type 1.5: Glycotoxic Alzheimer's
This type exhibits features of both inflammatory and atrophic types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. It is primarily driven by [[Alzheimers disease and insulin resistance | insulin resistance]] and chronic high insulin, which alters signaling pathways by phosphorylating IRS-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. This reduces insulin's role as a supportive trophic factor (atrophic component) and causes protein glycation (inflammatory component), measured by hemoglobin A1C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

### Type 3: Toxic or "Vile" Alzheimer's
This form is a response to toxins, including metalotoxins like mercury, organic toxins (e.g., DDE), and biotoxins such as mycotoxins produced by molds (e.g., Stachybotrys, Aspergillus, Penicillium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Individuals with Type 3 often present with non-amnestic symptoms like executive dysfunction, problems with calculation, visual perception, or word finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. They may also exhibit low serum zinc, high copper-zinc ratios, and low triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

### Other Contributing Factors
Vascular (Type 4) and traumatic (Type 5) components are also recognized, though they often relate back to the core issues of [[Role of inflammation in aging and disease | inflammation]], trophic support, and toxin exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

## The ReCODE Protocol: A Programmatic Approach

Dr. Bredesen emphasizes that [[Alzheimers disease and insulin resistance | Alzheimer's]] is a complex chronic illness with dozens of contributing factors, necessitating a multi-pronged, personalized approach rather than monotherapeutics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>. The ReCODE protocol (Reversal of Cognitive Decline), formerly MEND, has shown improvement in over 3,000 individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.

### Biomarkers for Cognitive Decline and Risk
A "cognoscopy" is recommended for everyone aged 45 or over to assess risk factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. Key [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | biomarkers]] include:
*   **Inflammation:** High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>.
*   **Methylation:** Homocysteine (optimally less than 7, not 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>. High homocysteine is linked to more rapid decline in cerebral grey matter and hippocampal volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.
*   **Glycotoxicity/Insulin Resistance:** Fasting insulin (optimally less than 5), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), and fasting glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>.
*   **Trophic Support:** Vitamin D (optimal levels), pregnenolone, progesterone, estradiol, testosterone, free T3, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>.
*   **Toxins:** Assessing exposure to metalotoxins (e.g., mercury), organic toxins (e.g., DDE), and biotoxins (e.g., mycotoxins from mold exposure via ERMI scores and urinary tests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>.

### Dietary and Lifestyle Interventions
The **Ketoflex 12/3 diet** is a cornerstone of the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>:
*   **Keto:** Aims for mild ketosis (1.5-4 millimolar beta-hydroxybutyrate) with a very low-carbohydrate, high-good-fat diet (avocados, nuts, seeds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:00">[27:34:00]</a>. While MCT oil can be used initially to induce ketosis, [[Role of ApoE4 in Alzheimers disease | ApoE4]] carriers should transition to more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats to balance cardiovascular and cognitive outcomes, monitoring LDL particle number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:05:00">[34:05:05]</a>.
*   **Flexitarian:** Allows for meat and fish as condiments, with emphasis on quality (pastured chicken, grass-fed beef, wild-caught fish) and avoidance of high-mercury fish (e.g., tuna, shark, swordfish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a>. "Smash fish" (salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines, herring) are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14:00">[30:14:00]</a>.
*   **12/3:** Refers to fasting periods. A minimum 12-hour overnight fast is recommended, extended to 14-16 hours for [[Role of ApoE4 in Alzheimers disease | ApoE4]] carriers to promote autophagy and brain cleansing via the [[connections_between_sleep and Alzheimers disease | glymphatic system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>. A 3-hour minimum gap between dinner and bedtime is also crucial to avoid high insulin levels impacting cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>.
*   **Organic/Plant-rich:** Emphasizes organic, plant-rich foods to minimize exposure to "dementogens" (toxins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:42:00">[32:42:00]</a>.

### Other Important Interventions
*   **Exercise:** Essential for increasing BDNF and aiding metabolic flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a>.
*   **Sleep:** Adequate sleep allows for the [[connections_between_sleep_and_alzheimers_disease | glymphatic system]] to clear waste products from the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>.
*   **Stress Management:** Surprisingly important in overall resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:45:00">[54:45:00]</a>.
*   **Detoxification (e.g., Saunas):** Saunas are part of the protocol, aiding in the removal of hydrophobic toxins like cadmium, mercury, and BPA through sweat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:59:00">[52:59:00]</a>.

### Addressing Underlying Issues for Effective Treatment
Failed clinical trials targeting amyloid beta plaques highlight the need to address the root causes of [[Alzheimers disease and insulin resistance | Alzheimer's]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:20:00">[56:20:00]</a>. Amyloid is a mediator, not the primary cause, and serves a protective function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:48:00">[56:48:00]</a>. Removing amyloid is only effective if the underlying causes (pathogens, toxins, metabolic changes) are first addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:09:00">[57:09:00]</a>.

### Gut Health
Leaky gut is a common contributor to chronic inflammatory conditions, including cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:22:00">[41:22:00]</a>. Gut health can be assessed through stool analysis tests (e.g., Genova GI effects, Doctor's Data) and Cyrex arrays that detect antibodies to LPS (indicating leaky gut) and gluten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:33:00">[55:33:00]</a>.

Dr. Bredesen believes that [[Alzheimers disease and insulin resistance | Alzheimer's disease]] should become a rare condition with current knowledge and personalized interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.

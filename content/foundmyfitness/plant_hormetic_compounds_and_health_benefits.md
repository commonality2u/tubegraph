Plant hormetic compounds are substances found in fruits and vegetables that, unlike micronutrients, are biologically stressful to cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This mild stress triggers cellular stress response pathways that are ultimately beneficial, as the cell "over responds" to the otherwise slightly toxic insult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

These compounds activate various genetic pathways that enhance the body's and brain's ability to cope with stress, leading to beneficial effects in both the short and long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Many are classified as polyphenols or flavonols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This concept aligns with [[hormesis_and_plant_phytochemicals | hormesis and plant phytochemicals]] and [[hormesis_and_resilience_through_shortterm_stressors | hormesis and resilience through short-term stressors]].

## Key Plant Hormetic Compounds and Their Benefits

### Isothiocyanates
Isothiocyanates are a class of plant hormetic compounds found in cruciferous vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Kale is a source, and [[broccoli_sprouts_and_chemoprotection | broccoli sprouts]] are a robust source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

*   **Anti-Cancer Properties**: [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | Isothiocyanates]] exhibit potent anti-cancer properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
    *   They inhibit Phase 1 biotransformation enzymes, which convert pro-carcinogens into active carcinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   They activate Phase 2 detoxification enzymes, including glutathione reductase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. These enzymes reduce DNA and cellular damage by lowering inflammation and reactive oxygen species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Phase 2 enzymes also inactivate pro-carcinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Cancer Prevention**: Isothiocyanates are very potent at preventing cancer initiation in both animal and human studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Luteolin and Apigenin
Luteolin and apigenin are flavonoids found in celery and parsley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. These are examples of the [[health_benefits_of_flavonoids | health benefits of flavonoids]].

*   **Luteolin**:
    *   Decreases inflammation by reducing the expression of genes involved in inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    *   A study of nearly 67,000 women showed that those with high luteolin intake had a 34% decrease in cancer incidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Inflammation can damage DNA, which initiates cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   Slows cognitive decline in older mice, making their brains function like younger counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Apigenin**:
    *   Causes neural stem cells to form new neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
    *   Strengthens connections between neurons, important for learning and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
    *   Shown to kill cancer cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Anthocyanins and Pterostilbene
Blueberries are rich in plant hormetic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. While antioxidants are often cited, the effects may be more significant due to these compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

*   **Anthocyanins**:
    *   Abundant in blueberries and are important plant hormetic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    *   In a study, blueberry extract prevented cognitive and behavioral deficits in mice genetically engineered to develop Alzheimer's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    *   Specifically activate Nrf2, a master regulator of genes involved in inflammation and antioxidant activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Pterostilbene**:
    *   Chemically similar to resveratrol, found in blueberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   Activates the gene PPAR alpha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
    *   Lowers triglyceride and blood glucose levels in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
    *   More potent than resveratrol in improving cognitive function in mice engineered for premature aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Ursolic Acid and Glucaric Acid
Apples contain these beneficial plant hormetic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

*   **Ursolic Acid**:
    *   Present in apple skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
    *   Increases muscle mass by 10% and muscle strength by 30% in mice fed a diet containing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This relates to [[influence_of_hormones_and_supplements_on_muscle_health | influence of hormones and supplements on muscle health]].
    *   Works by inhibiting ATF4, a gene that normally prevents protein synthesis in muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Glucaric Acid**:
    *   Inhibits the activity of an enzyme in certain bacteria that converts pro-carcinogens into their active state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Addressing Concerns about "Anti-nutrients"
Some raw vegetables, like kale and spinach, contain compounds sometimes referred to as "anti-nutrients," leading to anxiety about their consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

### Isothiocyanates as "Goitrogens"
*   Isothiocyanates, while beneficial, are sometimes called "goitrogens" because small amounts can compete for iodine transport into the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   However, high levels from cruciferous vegetables have not been shown to increase hypothyroidism unless accompanied by severe iodine deficiency, which is uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   Numerous animal studies show that large quantities of [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | isothiocyanates]] do not cause hypothyroidism; instead, they inhibit cancer formation and prevent cancer initiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### Oxalate in Spinach
*   Oxalate, present in higher quantities in spinach, is a concern for kidney stone risk, as boiling can reduce its content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   Boiling does reduce soluble oxalate, which is absorbable and linked to kidney stone formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   However, magnesium and calcium ions cause oxalate to become insoluble, making it unabsorbable by the intestines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   Magnesium and calcium dramatically decrease oxalate absorption in healthy human volunteers to less than 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Spinach itself is high in magnesium and calcium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   Consuming raw spinach, particularly in a smoothie rich in magnesium and calcium, substantially reduces the amount of soluble oxalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

Despite theoretical risks, the benefits of these plant compounds, particularly their role in [[strategies_to_enhance_healthspan_and_address_agerelated_diseases | strategies to enhance healthspan]], are considered to outweigh potential concerns, especially given the lack of supporting literature for significant negative effects from typical dietary intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

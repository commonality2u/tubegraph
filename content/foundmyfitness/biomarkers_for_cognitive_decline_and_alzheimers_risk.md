Dr. Dale Bredesen, recognized for his understanding of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, emphasizes the importance of identifying and addressing the multiple factors contributing to cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His "ReCODE" protocol, initially "MEND" (Metabolic Enhancement for Neurodegeneration), utilizes a multi-pronged approach that includes identifying specific [[Biomarkers and their relevance in monitoring health and performance | biomarkers for health and performance]] to personalize treatment and prevention strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The goal is to understand *why* Alzheimer's occurs, moving away from single-target treatments to a programmatic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## Pathological Hallmarks: Amyloid Plaques and Tau Tangles

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau tangles in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. While amyloid is a neurotoxin, it also functions as a protectant, made by the brain in response to insults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. For example, it acts as an antimicrobial and a binder of divalent metals like copper, zinc, and iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. People can have amyloid plaques without experiencing dementia, highlighting the complex nature of the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The presence of amyloid indicates an increased risk for a degenerative process, but many individuals successfully protect themselves without "downsizing" of the brain network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## The "Cognoscopy" for Risk Assessment

Dr. Bredesen recommends that everyone aged 45 or over consider a "cognoscopy" â€“ a series of tests to assess their risk factors for cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This includes evaluating genetic factors, inflammatory issues, methylation issues, nutrient issues, and toxin issues, all of which can be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. The goal is to decrease the global burden of dementia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

## Key Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Risk and Subtypes

Dr. Bredesen's approach involves assessing a wide range of [[Biomarkers and their relevance in monitoring health and performance | biomarkers for health and performance]] to identify the specific contributing factors to an individual's cognitive decline. These factors are categorized into different subtypes of Alzheimer's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### 1. Genetic Factors: Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4)
ApoE4 is the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Prevalence:** About 75 million Americans have one copy of ApoE4, and approximately seven million have two copies (homozygous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Risk:**
    *   Zero copies (e.g., 3,3): ~9% lifetime risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
    *   One copy: ~30% lifetime risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
    *   Two copies (homozygous): Over 50%, potentially as high as 90% lifetime risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Function:** ApoE4 provides an advantage in pro-inflammatory, parasitic environments but can lead to chronic inflammation in modern settings, acting as an "antagonistic pleiotropy" gene that helps when young but increases disease risk later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

### 2. Type 1: Inflammatory ("Hot") Alzheimer's
This subtype is driven by pathogens or chronic inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Biomarkers:**
    *   **hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein):** A marker of inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
    *   **Pathogen exposure:** Includes [[Effect of inflammation and insulin resistance on Alzheimers | P. gingivalis]] (from leaky gut), *Borrelia* (Lyme disease), *Bartonella*, *Babesia*, *Ehrlichia*, and specific fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Herpes family viruses (CMV, EBV, HSV, HHV) can also induce amyloid production as part of the innate immune system response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
*   **Mechanism:** Inflammation can lead the brain to produce amyloid as a protective "napalm" to fight invaders, but this also "downsizes" the neural network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Management:** [[Dietary and lifestyle interventions for Alzheimers prevention | Lifestyle interventions]] like diet, exercise, and sleep can reduce inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. Omega-3 fatty acids and their derivatives (resolvins, maresins) are crucial for resolving inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

### 3. Type 1.5: Glycotoxic Alzheimer's
This subtype shares features of both inflammatory and atrophic types due to insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Biomarkers:**
    *   **Fasting insulin:** Optimally less than five, much lower than standard lab "normal limits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.
    *   **Hemoglobin A1C:** Reflects average blood glucose over the last two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Optimal A1C should be below 5.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
    *   **Fasting glucose:** Standard blood sugar measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Mechanism:** Chronic high insulin leads to insulin resistance, changing cellular signaling and reducing insulin's trophic (supportive) effect on the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Glycation of proteins (measured by hemoglobin A1C) also contributes to inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Brain insulin resistance can be detected even if peripheral insulin levels are normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.
*   **Management:** Dietary changes like the Ketoflex 12/3 diet (low carbohydrate, high healthy fats), regular exercise, and sufficient sleep are critical to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce glycotoxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

### 4. Type 2: Atrophic ("Cold") Alzheimer's
This subtype is characterized by decreased trophic (supportive) factors for synapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Biomarkers:**
    *   **Vitamin D:** Optimal levels are desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
    *   **Hormones:** Pregnenolone, progesterone, estradiol, testosterone, and free T3 (thyroid hormone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
    *   **Neurotrophic factors:** Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. While not easily measured clinically, their levels can be inferred by hippocampal volume or lifestyle (e.g., exercise increases BDNF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **Mechanism:** Insufficient support for synapses leads to a "downsizing" of the neural network, as the brain cannot maintain all its connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Management:** Optimizing hormone levels, vitamin D, and promoting neurotrophic factors through exercise and appropriate nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>.

### 5. Type 3: Toxic ("Vile") Alzheimer's
This subtype is a response to environmental toxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Biomarkers:**
    *   **Metalotoxins:** Mercury (e.g., from seafood, dental amalgams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.
    *   **Organic toxins:** Like DDE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.
    *   **Biotoxins/Mycotoxins:** Produced by mold species (e.g., *Stachybotrys*, *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*), including trycothesinson, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin, gliotoxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
    *   **Zinc and Copper-Zinc Ratio:** Often low serum zinc and high copper-zinc ratios are observed in Type 3 Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. High copper-zinc ratios have been linked to dementia for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Zinc deficiency is common globally and can affect hundreds of enzymes vital for cognition, insulin function, and immune responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Presentation:** Often non-amnestic (executive dysfunction, calculation problems, visual perception, word finding), and common in younger individuals (late 40s to mid-50s), often women and ApoE4 negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Management:** Identifying and removing source of exposure to toxins, and enhancing detoxification pathways (e.g., through sauna use, which helps excrete hydrophobic toxins like cadmium and mercury through sweat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>.

### 6. Gut Health Markers
Gut health is a common contributing factor to chronic inflammatory conditions, including cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>.
*   **Tests:**
    *   **Stool analysis:** (e.g., Genova GI Effects, Doctor's Data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.
    *   **Cyrex arrays:** Blood tests that look for antibodies.
        *   Cyrex array 2: Detects responses to things like LPS (lipopolysaccharide) indicating leaky gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.
        *   Cyrex array 3: Looks at various domains of gluten and gliadin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>.
*   **Mechanism:** Leaky gut can lead to chronic inflammatory conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.
*   **Management:** Addressing gut issues is a critical part of the protocol.

## Intervening in Multiple Pathways

Alzheimer's disease is a complex chronic illness with dozens of contributing factors, making a single "mono-therapeutic" drug approach ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. The failure of clinical trials targeting only amyloid plaques demonstrates the need for a comprehensive, personalized program that addresses all underlying causes, including inflammation, insulin resistance, and toxic burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>. The goal is to optimize a wide range of [[Biomarkers and their relevance in monitoring health and performance | biomarkers for health and performance]] to change cellular signaling and support synaptic health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>.

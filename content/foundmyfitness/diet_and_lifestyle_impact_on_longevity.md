Dr. Valter Longo, a leading expert in how [[Diet and nutrition for performance and longevity | diet]] and [[impact_of_lifestyle_habits_on_aging_and_longevity | lifestyle]] regulate [[longevity and health strategies | longevity]], particularly through fasting, emphasizes the reproducible impact of limiting food intake on the aging process across various organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Modalities of Limiting Food Intake

Longo distinguishes between different forms of food restriction, noting that the broad term "intermittent fasting" can be misleading due to the wide range of practices it encompasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Defined Modalities
*   **Intermittent Fasting (IF)**: A broad category that can include:
    *   Alternate day fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   The 5:2 diet (two days a week of very restricted diet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    *   One day a week of complete fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF)**: Refers to limiting the daily window during which food is consumed, such as eating only between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. (12 hours of feeding, 12 hours of fasting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Caloric Restriction (CR)**: In the scientific field, this term specifically refers to the chronic reduction of calories below the normal level required to maintain body weight, practiced consistently over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Periodic Prolonged Fasting (PPF)**: This involves at least two days of complete fasting or adherence to a fasting-mimicking diet. It is not necessarily frequent and can be done from once to twenty times a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

While these interventions may share some commonalities, they are distinct and produce different effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Effects of Caloric Restriction on Longevity and Healthspan

Chronic caloric restriction has shown "unbelievable effects" on health, particularly in preventing diseases like diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Monkey studies, for instance, demonstrated that CR could completely eliminate diabetes and reduce cardiovascular disease and cancer by 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

However, the impact of CR on overall lifespan extension in these monkey studies has been mixed. One study (Wisconsin) showed a slight increase in mean lifespan, while another (NIH) did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, although both increased healthspan (disease-free life) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The difference in results between the two studies may be partly due to the control diets used; the NIH diet was described as more ideal than the Wisconsin diet, which resembled a Western diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Key Genetic Pathways and Biomarkers of Aging

[[Effects of Diet on Aging | Dietary interventions]], including caloric restriction and fasting, modulate several key genetic pathways and biomarkers associated with aging. These include:
*   **IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1)**: Regulated by proteins and specific amino acids (e.g., methionine, cysteine), IGF-1 plays a significant role in aging in various organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. High protein intake, even during caloric restriction, can prevent IGF-1 levels from lowering in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Restricting proteins, however, can lower IGF-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **mTOR (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin)**: A nutrient-sensing pathway often downregulated by caloric restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **PKA (Protein Kinase A)**: Glucose levels activate PKA, which is central to handling both protein and sugar signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Ras**: While its role in mammalian cells is still being explored, Ras gene expression is also down-regulated during periods of nutrient restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

These pathways are interconnected and influenced by nutrient availability. Low IGF-1, insulin, and TOR levels are associated with increased lifespan and healthspan, as observed in mice with growth hormone receptor deficiency and humans with Laron's syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. These individuals are protected from cancer, diabetes, and age-dependent cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### Metabolic Flexibility
Fasting promotes a shift in metabolism towards beta-oxidation (fat burning) and ketone body production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. While chronic caloric restriction may induce a minimal ketogenic state, it is less pronounced than during prolonged fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This metabolic flexibility, the ability to switch between using glucose and fatty acids for energy, is thought to be beneficial for overall health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

## The Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD)

The fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) was developed to provide the [[Benefits of Fasting | health benefits of prolonged fasting]] while allowing individuals to consume some food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Initially, it was developed for cancer patients who were unwilling to undergo water-only fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. The FMD is formulated to mimic the effects of water-only fasting on IGF-1, IGFBP-1, ketone bodies, and glucose levels by carefully controlling amino acid and sugar content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

### FMD in Healthy Subjects
A randomized clinical trial involving three cycles of a 5-day FMD, performed once a month for three consecutive months, demonstrated "remarkable" results in healthy individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Normalization of Biomarkers**: For individuals with elevated levels, the FMD effectively decreased cholesterol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>, triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>, IGF-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>, fasting glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>, and blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. Systemic inflammation (CRP) also returned to the normal range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. Notably, if these markers were already at healthy levels, the FMD did not drive them lower, distinguishing it from chronic caloric restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
*   **Sustained Effects**: Three months after the last FMD cycle, approximately 60% of the beneficial changes in biomarkers were still significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: For average healthy individuals, performing the FMD once every four months is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Those with risk factors for diseases (e.g., obesity, high cholesterol) may benefit from doing it more frequently, perhaps once a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.
*   **Body Composition**: Unlike many diets that lead to loss of fat, water, and muscle, FMD results in temporary muscle loss during the fasting period, which is then rebuilt during refeeding. It specifically targets visceral fat (abdominal fat) without significantly impacting subcutaneous fat or overall lean body mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. This makes it a potential method to maintain lean body mass while losing fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.
*   **Safety**: With over 25,000 individuals having used the clinically tested FMD (Prolon), very few severe side effects have been reported, and none were conclusively linked to the diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

### FMD and Disease Management
The FMD is being explored as a complementary intervention for various diseases:
*   **Cancer**: In animal studies, FMD combined with standard cancer treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy) has shown promising results by sensitizing cancer cells to treatment while protecting normal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. Clinical trials are ongoing, although challenges like food aversion in cancer patients need to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. Oncologists may consider recommending FMD alongside standard care for patients who cannot wait for clinical trial completion, with appropriate caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.
*   **Diabetes and Autoimmune Diseases**: Research indicates FMD's potential applicability for [[impact of gut health on aging and longevity | autoimmune diseases]] and diabetes, including Type 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. It appears to kill immune cells and then activate stem cells to replace them with healthy ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.
*   **Neurodegeneration (e.g., Alzheimer's)**: FMD is also being investigated for its potential in neurodegenerative conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.

## Rejuvenation and Self-Repair Mechanisms

Periodic prolonged fasting and the FMD induce a "reset" of the body's systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
*   **Organ Shrinking and Re-expansion**: During fasting, organs temporarily shrink, and then expand back to normal size during refeeding. This process involves the clearing of intracellular components via autophagy and the elimination of damaged cells through apoptosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.
*   **Stem Cell Activation**: Fasting activates stem cells, which then proliferate and differentiate during the refeeding phase to replace damaged cells and regenerate healthy tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. This process of destruction followed by reconstruction is a unique advantage of prolonged fasting over chronic caloric restriction, which lacks the refeeding component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>. Low IGF-1 signals stem cells to self-renew, and then during refeeding, increased IGF-1 drives their proliferation and differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>. Sufficient protein intake during refeeding is crucial for rebuilding these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

Longo speculates that fasting represents an evolved "auto-repair mode" that allows the body to fix internal damage, a mechanism potentially lost in modern society due to constant food availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. This "reset" capability is seen as more sophisticated than simply blocking specific pathways, drawing upon billions of years of evolutionary learning to repair systems like the liver or address insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>.

## Recommended Biomarkers for Healthy Aging

For individuals looking to monitor their [[impact_of_lifestyle_factors_on_epigenetic_aging | biological age]] and health, Dr. Longo suggests regular measurement of:
1.  **IGF-1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>
2.  **Insulin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>
3.  **Glucose** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>
4.  **Systemic Inflammation (CRP)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>
5.  **Triglycerides** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>
6.  **Blood Pressure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>

Other indicators such as fatty liver and [[lifestyle_factors_influencing_telomere_length_and_health | telomere length]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>, and especially methylation profiles (associated with Steve Horvath's work on [[impact of lifestyle factors on epigenetic aging | epigenetic aging]]), are emerging as predictive markers of biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>.

## "The Longevity Diet"

Dr. Longo's book, "The Longevity Diet," is divided into two main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>.
*   **Everyday Diet**: Based on five pillars: epidemiological studies, centenarian studies, basic research on longevity, clinical studies, and studies of complex systems (e.g., cars, planes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. It draws heavily from the dietary patterns of centenarian groups globally, noting the absence of ketogenic diets among populations with record longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.
*   **Fasting-Mimicking Diet**: Discusses the FMD's application in normal populations and its potential as a complementary intervention for major diseases such as diabetes (Type 1 and 2), autoimmune conditions, Alzheimer's, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. It emphasizes the need for physician supervision, especially for disease-specific applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>.

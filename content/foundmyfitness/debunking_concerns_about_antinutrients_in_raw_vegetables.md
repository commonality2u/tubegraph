Many people experience undue anxiety about consuming raw, uncooked vegetables, such as kale, due to their perceived "antinutrient" content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. However, the benefits of these vegetables often outweigh the theoretical [[Safety and Potential Risks of Consuming Cruciferous Vegetables | risks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

## Isothiocyanates: Not the Enemy

[[Isothiocyanates and Glucosinolates in Cruciferous Vegetables | Isothiocyanates]] are beneficial plant hormetic compounds present in kale and other [[Isothiocyanates and Glucosinolates in Cruciferous Vegetables | cruciferous vegetables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. In fact, Dr. Rhonda Patrick's [[Micronutrient smoothie ingredients and benefits | smoothie recipe]] is designed to maximize, not minimize, its [[Isothiocyanates and Glucosinolates in Cruciferous Vegetables | isothiocyanate]] content due to their potent [[Broccoli Sprouts and Chemoprotection | anti-cancer properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

Concerns sometimes arise because [[Isothiocyanates and Glucosinolates in Cruciferous Vegetables | isothiocyanates]] have been referred to as goitrogens, meaning a small amount can compete for iodine transport into the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. However, high levels of [[Isothiocyanates and Glucosinolates in Cruciferous Vegetables | isothiocyanates]] from consuming large quantities of [[Isothiocyanates and Glucosinolates in Cruciferous Vegetables | cruciferous vegetables]] have not been shown to increase hypothyroidism, unless accompanied by severe iodine deficiency, which is uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Numerous animal studies have shown that feeding animals large quantities of [[Isothiocyanates and Glucosinolates in Cruciferous Vegetables | isothiocyanates]] does not cause hypothyroidism and, in fact, inhibits cancer formation and prevents cancer initiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

## Oxalates in Spinach

Another "antinutrient" that has gained reputation is oxalate, which is present in higher quantities in spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Concerns have been raised that oxalate from spinach may increase kidney stone risk unless the spinach is boiled to decrease its oxalate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

While boiling does reduce the amount of soluble oxalate (the type absorbable by human intestines and associated with kidney stone formation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>, it has been shown that both magnesium and calcium ions cause oxalate to become insoluble, making it unabsorbable by the human intestines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Both magnesium and calcium ions have been shown to dramatically decrease oxalate absorption in healthy human volunteers to less than 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. This is a primary reason why raw spinach is still consumed, as it is very high in magnesium and also contains calcium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The [[Micronutrient smoothie ingredients and benefits | smoothie]] itself is very high in magnesium and calcium, which substantially reduces the amount of soluble oxalate present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

Anecdotal evidence from personal consumption of such smoothies for five years, coupled with compelling animal studies, suggests that the [[Sulforaphane and its Health Benefits | benefits]] of obtaining [[Isothiocyanates and Glucosinolates in Cruciferous Vegetables | isothiocyanates]] and other nutrients from raw vegetables far outweigh any theoretical [[Safety and Potential Risks of Consuming Cruciferous Vegetables | risks]] that are not strongly supported by existing literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

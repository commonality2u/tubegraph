**Caloric restriction** and **intermittent fasting** are dietary interventions that have been shown to influence aging processes and healthspan. These methods trigger natural defense mechanisms in the body by activating specific longevity genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Action

A significant breakthrough in aging research in the 1980s and early 1990s identified that certain genes, termed "longevity genes," control aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These genes, initially discovered in organisms like yeast cells and nematode worms, are also present in humans and nearly all life forms on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Sirtuins

A key class of these longevity genes are the **sirtuins**, which are enzymes that control gene expression (turning genes on and off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The sirtuins (specifically SIR2 in yeast) were found to control lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Studies showed that having more sirtuins provides benefits similar to [[caloric_restriction_fasting_and_nutrient_sensing_pathways | calorie restriction]] or dieting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. In fact, if the SIR2 gene is removed, the benefits of [[caloric_restriction_and_aging | calorie restriction]] no longer manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This concept, initially found in yeast, is largely similar in mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### NAD and Sirtuin Activation

Sirtuins require **nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)** to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Without NAD, sirtuins are inhibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. NAD levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day and in response to diet and exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. They rise during the day and decrease after a large meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. NAD levels also decrease with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Increasing NAD levels aims to "trick the body into thinking that it's young again, or it's been exercising, or dieting," thereby enabling sirtuins to function optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

## Caloric Restriction vs. Intermittent Fasting

Historically, **caloric restriction** in mammals involved reducing food intake by 30-40%, often leading to constant hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. In yeast, it meant reducing sugar levels in the petri dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

[[intermittent_fasting_and_metabolic_switching | Intermittent fasting]] is another approach that activates these longevity genes (sirtuins) without requiring continuous hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. It allows individuals to eat for several days a week while still benefiting from periods of fasting that elevate sirtuin activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Overlap and Differences

There is significant overlap in the beneficial [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | health effects]] of [[caloric_restriction_and_aging | caloric restriction]] and [[intermittent_fasting_and_metabolic_switching | intermittent fasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. However, key differences include the metabolic shift during intermittent fasting from carbohydrate (glucose) to fatty acid metabolism, which can lead to [[intermittent_fasting_and_ketosis | ketogenesis]] during more prolonged fasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Studies show that calorie-restricted rats have dramatically increased levels of SIRT1 in their liver and muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This increase was found to be linked to lower insulin and IGF-1 levels, demonstrating a connection between sirtuins, [[caloric_restriction_fasting_and_nutrient_sensing_pathways | caloric restriction]], and the insulin pathway in mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. All these pathways (sirtuins, AMP kinase, mTOR, insulin/IGF-1 signaling) interact as a network, influencing how the body responds to its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Impact on Aging Pathways

[[intermittent_fasting_and_its_effects_on_aging_pathways | Fasting]] and [[caloric_restriction_fasting_and_nutrient_sensing_pathways | caloric restriction]] affect multiple aging pathways, including AMP kinase, sirtuins, mTOR, and IGF-1/insulin signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. These pathways are considered relatively safe to influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. Fasting can slow down and stabilize epigenome decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

## Related Compounds and Mimetics

### Resveratrol
Resveratrol, a molecule found in stressed plants like grapes, activates sirtuins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. It is believed to act as an "accelerator pedal" for sirtuins, making them work faster in conjunction with NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Studies in mice have shown that resveratrol can lead to healthier outcomes, particularly for cardiovascular health, even on a high-fat diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. It appears to reduce oxidative stress and dampen macrophage infiltration in arteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. A primate study with rhesus monkeys showed that resveratrol could ameliorate aortic stiffness caused by a high-sucrose and high-fat diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

Resveratrol also appears to activate autophagy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>, a cellular clean-up process, by decreasing protein acetylation through sirtuin activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.

### NAD Boosters
[[caloric_restriction_mimetics_and_their_potential_therapeutic_benefits | NAD boosters]] are precursors to NAD, such as Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) and Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. These molecules increase NAD levels in animals and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.

NMN is converted into NAD in one step within the cell by the NAMPT enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>. NR is a smaller version of NMN that must first have a phosphorus added before it is converted to NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

[[human_and_animal_studies_on_fasting_and_timerestricted_feeding | Animal studies]] have shown that NMN can improve various health parameters, including endurance, and reduce frailty in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. It has also shown promise in improving memory and slowing Alzheimer's progression in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>, and can help restore blood flow in the brain and muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

A crucial consideration for NAD boosters is their stability; they should be kept cold to prevent degradation into nicotinamide, which can inhibit sirtuins and interfere with DNA repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.

## Conclusion

Caloric restriction and intermittent fasting are potent activators of innate longevity pathways. These interventions work by influencing genes like sirtuins and maintaining NAD levels, ultimately helping the body repair and resist the aging process. While these lifestyle factors provide significant benefits, ongoing research explores more potent interventions, including novel NAD boosters and epigenetic resetting technologies, to potentially reverse aspects of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

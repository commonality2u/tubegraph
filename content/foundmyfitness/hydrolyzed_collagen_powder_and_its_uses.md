Hydrolyzed collagen powder is a notable ingredient in some health-focused smoothie recipes, offering specific amino acids and potential benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## Composition and Purpose
Unlike essential amino acids like leucine, hydrolyzed collagen powder is primarily valued for its non-essential amino acids, particularly glycine and proline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.

*   **Glycine** makes up approximately 35% of collagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.
*   **Proline** and hydroxyproline together constitute about 25% of collagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

Collagen itself accounts for 25% to 35% of the body's total protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. It is abundant in ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and skin, and is also found in blood vessels, muscle, the gut, and tooth dentin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. The body constantly manufactures new collagen to repair connective tissue lost to daily wear and tear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.

## Absorption and Accumulation
A study involving radio-labeled hydrolyzed collagen fed to mice investigated its absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. The findings revealed that:
*   Some collagen was degraded into individual amino acids and absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.
*   A portion of the collagen was absorbed fully intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.
*   Intact collagen was shown to accumulate in cartilage over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.

## Benefits and Roles of Key Amino Acids
### Proline
Proline, which is highly abundant in hydrolyzed collagen, serves multiple functions:
*   **Energy Production** Proline can be converted into glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate, allowing it to be used by the mitochondria to produce ATP (energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. This pathway is particularly relevant during catabolic conditions, such as when glucose levels are low, as proline is released from connective tissue and converted to alpha-ketoglutarate for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.
*   **Wound Healing** Proline may play a special role in wound healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>. Ten days after a wound occurs, proline levels at the wound site can be 50% higher than plasma levels, suggesting it is actively transported there to assist in healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>.

### Glycine
Glycine, also highly abundant in hydrolyzed collagen powder, has other interesting properties:
*   **Anti-inflammatory Signaling** It has been identified as an anti-inflammatory signaling molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.
*   **Neurotransmitter** Glycine functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.

The specific functions of the glycine found in hydrolyzed collagen powder in these roles require further study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>.

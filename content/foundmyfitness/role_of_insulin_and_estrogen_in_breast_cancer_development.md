Research at the interface of metabolism and breast cancer, including its risk and recurrence, highlights the significant roles of insulin and estrogen as key growth factors in this disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Connecting Metabolism and Breast Cancer Risk

Lifestyle factors are known to influence breast cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. [[Impact of obesity on breast cancer risk | Obesity]] is a significant risk factor, along with physical inactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Diet quality, [[Impact of obesity on breast cancer risk | obesity]], physical activity, and even tobacco use are considered top concerns for increasing breast cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Studies, including those cited by the American Cancer Association, suggest that [[Impact of obesity on breast cancer risk | obesity]] can increase breast cancer risk by twofold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The mechanisms by which [[Impact of obesity on breast cancer risk | obesity]] increases breast cancer risk include:
*   Increased inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   Increased estrogen levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Increased fasting insulin levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

## The Role of Estrogen as a Growth Factor

Estrogen has long been recognized as a risk factor for breast cancer due to its role as a growth factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Blocking the action of estrogen with drugs has been a successful strategy to reduce breast cancer risk and recurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## The Role of Insulin as a Growth Factor

More recently, the importance of other growth factors, such as insulin, has been realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Insulin is also a growth factor that encourages metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. High levels of circulating insulin are believed to be central to the development and growth promotion of breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

High insulin levels are commonly observed in:
*   Overweight individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
*   Less physically active individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   Diabetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>

This suggests that elevated insulin may be a common pathway through which various syndromes contribute to increased breast cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## The Interplay of Insulin and Estrogen

Overweight and [[Impact of obesity on breast cancer risk | obese]] individuals not only have higher circulating insulin levels but also higher circulating estrogen levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Fat tissue itself can secrete estrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Additionally, high insulin levels are associated with lower levels of serum-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. SHBG binds estrogen, preventing it from being active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Thus, insulin and estrogen pathways are interconnected, playing off each other rather than being independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Impact on Tumor Growth

These growth factors, such as insulin and estrogen, promote the growth of tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. When cells sustain damage, there are inherent mechanisms to trigger cell death (apoptosis) to prevent potential cancer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. However, in the presence of these growth signaling factors, damaged cells are encouraged to continue growing and survive, rather than die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

This combination of factors, including:
*   High inflammation (often associated with [[Impact of obesity on breast cancer risk | obesity]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   High insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   High insulin-like growth factor (though data on circulating levels are less consistent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
*   High estrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>

creates a detrimental environment where damaged cells receive growth signals that allow them to survive and potentially progress to invasive tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The complexity of these interconnected systems with redundancies and cross-talk makes finding simple cures challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Key Biomarkers and Lifestyle Modification

The three major metabolic pathways thought to contribute to breast cancer risk are high fasting insulin, high free estrogen, and high inflammatory markers (like C-reactive protein) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Each of these factors individually increases breast cancer risk by approximately twofold, with a likely combined effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

These biomarkers can be significantly modified by lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Research suggests that [[timerestricted_eating_and_breast_cancer_prevention | meal timing]], specifically a nightly fast of at least 13 hours, can impact these markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This approach aims to align eating patterns with the body's natural circadian rhythm, where humans are most insulin sensitive in the morning and less so as the day progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Eating a large meal in the evening when insulin sensitivity is lower can dysregulate metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

In a study of 2,500 breast cancer survivors, at least 13 hours of fasting was associated with a 40% reduction in breast cancer recurrence, regardless of food quality or weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. It also showed a non-statistically significant trend towards a 20% reduction in mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The beneficial effects on inflammation were particularly observed when fasting began early in the evening (e.g., 6 PM to 6 AM fast), suggesting that the timing of the fast matters for reducing C-reactive protein levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. Fasting also consistently reduced Hemoglobin A1C, a key marker of average blood glucose levels over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

The majority of breast cancers (65% to 75%) are thought to be influenced by lifestyle factors such as [[Impact of obesity on breast cancer risk | obesity]], diet, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol, rather than solely by genetic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>. This emphasizes that lifestyle choices play a crucial role in modifying breast cancer risk and recurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

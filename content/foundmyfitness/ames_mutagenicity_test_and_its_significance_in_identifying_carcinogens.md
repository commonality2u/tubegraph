## Overview of the Ames Test
The Ames Mutagenicity Test is a simple and inexpensive method developed by [[bruce_ames_and_his_contributions_to_nutrition_science | Dr. Bruce Ames]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. This test utilizes bacteria to determine if chemical compounds are mutagenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. A mutagenic compound is one that can [[dna_damage_and_cancer_initiation | damage DNA]], induce a mutation, and thereby act as a carcinogen, which can cause [[cancer_development_and_its_relationship_with_cellular_senescence | cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

## Key Identifications and Impact

### Permanent Hair Dyes
In the 1970s, the Ames test was instrumental in identifying a primary component in permanent hair dyes that was mutagenic and thus a potential carcinogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>. After this finding was published and communicated to hair dye companies, the identified chemical compound was eventually removed from their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.

### Flame Retardants in Children's Pajamas
The Ames test also revealed that the main chemical used in flame retardants for children's pajamas was mutagenic and could therefore be a carcinogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. As a result of this discovery, children's pajamas no longer contain these carcinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>.

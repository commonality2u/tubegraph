Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a crucial molecule for life, so important that without it, life would cease to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In recent years, [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] has become highly relevant to the field of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## NAD Levels Decrease with Age

A key reason for the interest in NAD is that its levels naturally decrease with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This reduction in [[NAD levels and their impact on aging and metabolism | NAD levels across multiple tissues]] is associated with many hallmarks of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

While the complete answer for why [[NAD levels and their impact on aging and metabolism | NAD levels decrease with age]] remains an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, several factors are known:
*   **Increased Consumption:** Chronic inflammation and immune activation, which tend to increase with age, consume NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Increased Demand:** The heightened need for [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | DNA repair]] with age places immense demand on the NAD pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Decreased Production and Recycling:** The body's ability to produce and recycle NAD also declines with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The major source of NAD in the body is through a recycling mechanism called the NAD salvage pathway, which becomes less efficient with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Hallmarks of Aging Associated with NAD Decline

The decrease in [[NAD levels and their impact on aging and metabolism | NAD levels]] across various tissues, including the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart—tissues with high metabolic demand—leads to generation and malfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. NAD depletion has been associated with:

*   **Loss of Proteostasis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   **[[Mitochondrial dysfunction and its role in cellular aging | Mitochondrial Dysfunction]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
*   **Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Insensitivity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   **Cellular Senescence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   **Altered Epigenetics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

### Impaired DNA Repair

NAD promotes [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | DNA repair]] capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Its decline is associated with an increase in DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. NAD is a cofactor for PARP1, a crucial enzyme involved in repairing DNA damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Excessive DNA damage and subsequent PARP1 activation can significantly decrease NAD levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The ability to repair DNA damage is important for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Compromised Energy Metabolism

NAD is essential for [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | energy production]] in every tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It plays a critical role in [[NAD levels and their impact on aging and metabolism | energy metabolism]], participating in redox reactions crucial for the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids, and the formation of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Without NAD, energy cannot be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. When NAD levels decline with age, tissues like the brain, immune cells, and muscle tissue do not function properly as they did in youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Reduced Sirtuin Activation

NAD is required to activate sirtuins, an important family of enzymes involved in healthspan and longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Sirtuins regulate various metabolic processes, including stress response and lifespan modulation, through epigenetic regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. They use NAD to remove acetyl groups from cellular proteins, controlling genes involved in energy metabolism, autophagy, circadian rhythm, DNA repair, and cell survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Increased Susceptibility to Age-Related Diseases

Depletion of NAD may predispose organisms to the development of various age-related diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>:
*   Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>
*   Cardiovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>
*   Muscle atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>
*   Increased susceptibility to infections, as the immune system requires significant amounts of NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>

## Counteracting NAD Decline

Interestingly, NAD levels increase under conditions generally thought to promote healthspan, such as exercise, fasting, or caloric restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Furthermore, NAD restoration through various methods has been shown to increase lifespan in lower-level organisms (yeast, worms) and rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

[[NAD levels and their impact on aging and metabolism | NAD levels are heavily influenced by lifestyle]], particularly things that cause energy stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. While NAD can be synthesized from [[the_role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_aging | dietary sources]] like tryptophan (found in salmon, spinach, nuts) and the three forms of niacin (vitamin B3, found in lean meats, legumes, veggies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, these are not the major source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The body's demand for NAD exceeds its capacity to produce it from these forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, relying mostly on a recycling pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

[[Effects of NAD boosters and their impact on aging | NAD boosters]] like [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] (NR) and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] (NMN), which are consumer-available supplements, have shown promise in animal studies to improve the way multiple tissues and cell types age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. However, whether these boosters are effective and safe in humans long-term remains an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

In conclusion, NAD is vital for survival, and its decline with age contributes to metabolic and [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_its_role_in_cellular_aging | mitochondrial dysfunction]], increased DNA damage, and other problems associated with aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

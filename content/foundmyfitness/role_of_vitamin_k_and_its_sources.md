## Sources of Vitamin K
Rainbow chard is noted as a significant source of [[role_of_specific_vitamins_in_disease_prevention_and_treatment | vitamin K1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The discussed micronutrient smoothie, which includes about four rainbow chard leaves and stems, provides approximately 5,000 micrograms of [[role_of_specific_vitamins_in_disease_prevention_and_treatment | vitamin K1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This amount significantly exceeds the recommended daily intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

It is estimated that around 65% of the U.S. population does not meet the adequate daily intake for [[role_of_specific_vitemins_in_disease_prevention_and_treatment | vitamin K1]], which is set at approximately 90 to 120 micrograms per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Forms of Vitamin K
There are two biologically active forms of [[role_of_specific_vitamins_in_disease_prevention_and_treatment | vitamin K]]: [[role_of_specific_vitamins_in_disease_prevention_and_treatment | vitamin K1]] and [[role_of_specific_vitamins_in_disease_prevention_and_treatment | vitamin K2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Both forms are essential as cofactors to activate various proteins within the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Functions of Vitamin K
[[role_of_specific_vitamins_in_disease_prevention_and_treatment | Vitamin K1]] and [[role_of_specific_vitamins_in_disease_prevention_and_treatment | vitamin K2]] play critical roles in three main bodily functions:
1.  **Coagulation** The clotting of blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
2.  **Calcium Regulation** The removal of calcium from the bloodstream to prevent calcification of blood vessels and arteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
3.  **Bone Health** The transport of calcium to the bones, which is crucial for maintaining bone homeostasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

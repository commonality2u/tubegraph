From: [[foundmyfitness]] <br/> 

NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a molecule that has become highly relevant to the field of aging in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is considered one of the most important molecules, as life would cease to exist without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. NAD has precursor molecules such as nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), often referred to as [[effects_of_nad_boosters_and_their_impact_on_aging | NAD boosters]], which are available as consumer supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

In animal studies, very high doses of [[effects_of_nad_boosters_and_their_impact_on_aging | NAD boosters]] (NR and NMN) have been shown to improve the aging process in multiple tissues and cell types, including the heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and stem cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Clinical studies indicate that nicotinamide riboside can increase NAD levels in white blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Role of NAD

[[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] plays a critical role in various cellular processes essential for life and healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | NAD's Involvement in Energy Metabolism]]
NAD has a very important role in energy metabolism, being critical for energy production in every tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It participates in redox reactions crucial for the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids and the formation of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Without these molecules, life on Earth would cease to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. NAD also acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy production from glucose outside the mitochondria, a process known as glycolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. For example, red blood cells rely entirely on glycolysis for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | NAD's Involvement in DNA Repair]]
NAD is essential for repairing DNA damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. It is a cofactor for PARP1 (poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1), one of the most important enzymes involved in DNA repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Excessive DNA damage and subsequent PARP1 activation can significantly decrease NAD levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The ability to repair DNA damage is important for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>; centenarians exhibit significantly higher PARP1 activity than younger individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Genomic stability, which relies on NAD and PARP1, may be very important for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### NAD and Sirtuins
NAD is required to activate sirtuins, a family of enzymes involved in longevity and healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Sirtuins regulate metabolic processes, stress response, and lifespan through epigenetic regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. They use NAD to remove acetyl groups from cellular proteins, controlling gene activation related to energy metabolism, autophagy, circadian rhythm, DNA repair, and cell survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. When cellular energy levels are low, such as during exercise, fasting, or caloric restriction, NAD levels rise, which activates sirtuin expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Resveratrol, a compound found in red grapes, is a potent sirtuin-activating compound with beneficial effects on healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## [[effects_of_nad_decline_with_age | NAD Decline with Age]]

[[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] decrease with age across multiple tissues, including the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart, which have high metabolic demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This decline leads to improper tissue function compared to youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Hallmarks of Aging
A decrease in [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] is associated with many hallmarks of aging, including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>:
*   Loss of proteostasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   Mitochondrial dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   Glucose intolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Insulin insensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   Cellular senescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Altered epigenetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

### Factors Contributing to NAD Decline
The complete reason for [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] decreasing with age is still an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. However, it is thought to be a combination of decreased synthesis and recycling, as well as increased consumption and degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Increased Consumption**: Chronic inflammation and immune activation, which consume NAD, tend to rise with age, leading to an increased need for DNA repair and placing immense demand on the NAD pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Increased DNA damage and inflammation in aging may also decrease NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Decreased Production**: The body's ability to produce and recycle NAD also decreases with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Age-Related Diseases
Depletion of NAD may predispose organisms to various age-related diseases, including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>:
*   Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>
*   Cardiovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>
*   Muscle atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>
It may also increase susceptibility to infections, as the immune system requires large amounts of NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Boosting NAD Levels

NAD levels increase under conditions that promote healthspan, such as exercise and fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, or lifelong caloric restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. NAD restoration through various methods has been shown to increase lifespan in lower-level organisms like yeast and worms, as well as in rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Dietary Sources and Recycling
NAD can be synthesized in the body from dietary sources, including the amino acid tryptophan (found in salmon, spinach, nuts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> and the three forms of niacin (vitamin B3), namely nicotinamide (niacinamide), nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide riboside (found in lean meats, legumes, veggies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. However, dietary sources are not the major source of NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The body's demand for NAD is so large that it is impossible to consume enough from the diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Instead, the body primarily produces NAD through a recycling mechanism called the **NAD salvage pathway** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. In this pathway, nicotinamide, a by-product of NAD consumption by enzymes, is converted into nicotinamide mononucleotide and then into NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. However, nicotinamide has been shown to inhibit sirtuin activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Additionally, the enzyme that converts nicotinamide into nicotinamide mononucleotide is subject to feedback inhibition by NAD levels, meaning that beyond a certain concentration, nicotinamide will no longer be converted to NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

Nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide are found in low concentrations in many foods but are also available as supplements and are referred to as [[effects_of_nad_boosters_and_their_impact_on_aging | NAD boosters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. They can be converted into nicotinamide mononucleotide and subsequently NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## [[effects_of_nad_boosters_and_their_impact_on_aging | Effects of NAD Boosters]] (NR and NMN)

### Animal Studies
In supplement form, nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) have been shown to be well tolerated at high doses and to effectively raise NAD levels, ameliorating age-associated diseases in rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

*   **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)**:
    *   Counteracted an obesogenic diet by improving insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
    *   Improved endurance and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
    *   Reversed mitochondrial damage, increased mitochondrial biogenesis, and reversed muscular atrophy in animals with severe muscle wasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
    *   Had positive effects on the brain, increasing neurogenesis, decreasing cognitive deterioration and amyloid-beta production, and increasing synaptic plasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

*   **Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)**:
    *   Counteracted an obesogenic diet and improved metabolic health markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   Improved heart function in animals with heart problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
    *   Improved cognition and memory in animals with neurodegenerative disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
    *   A long-term study found that dietary NMN mitigated age-associated physiological decline in mice with accelerated aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. These mice showed improved skeletal muscle function, mitochondrial function, increased energy expenditure, increased bone density, and decreased insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. These benefits were dose-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### [[potential_health_benefits_and_risks_of_nad_supplementation | Potential Health Benefits and Risks of NAD Supplementation]]

#### Cancer Concerns
While many animal studies show NR and NMN can ameliorate age-related disease, there is a concern regarding cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. A recent study demonstrated that NMN accelerated cancer growth in mice with a type of pancreatic cancer driven by pro-inflammatory senescent cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Injected NMN significantly increased precancerous and cancerous lesions in the pancreas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. NAD appears to increase the tumorigenic quality of senescent cells, likely by boosting their energy metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. It is possible NR could show similar results in this specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. However, this does not mean NMN or NR supplementation will cause cancer or drive tumor progression in other cancer types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Long-term animal studies are needed to confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

#### Dose Translation to Humans
A major consideration for translating animal data to humans is the high doses used in animal studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>:
*   **Oral NR**: Rodent studies typically used 400 mg/kg body weight, which translates to a human equivalent dose of approximately 2.6 grams per day for a 180-pound person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This is a very high dose, higher than has been clinically tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **NMN**: Most NMN animal studies used high doses (around 500 mg/kg body weight) injected into the abdominal region, making direct translation to humans difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. An oral long-term aging study used 100 mg/kg body weight (human equivalent ~653 mg/day for 180 lbs) and 300 mg/kg body weight (human equivalent ~2 grams/day for 180 lbs), with the higher dose showing more robust benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

#### Bioavailability and Tissue Distribution
Another concern is the bioavailability of NR and NMN and whether they can reach other tissues intact to directly form NAD, bypassing the salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. NAD produced via the salvage pathway is subject to feedback inhibition, limiting how high NAD levels can be raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Oral Administration (Animal Studies)**: At low oral doses (around 50 mg/kg body weight), NR and NMN produced very low levels of directly made NAD only in the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. In the kidneys, muscles, and brain, only very low levels of directly made NAD were found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. A higher oral dose of NR (200 mg/kg body weight) showed no difference in direct NAD formation in tissues other than the liver compared to the low dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. However, more salvage pathway-derived NAD was found in the kidney, muscle, and brain at the higher dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. This suggests that even at high oral doses, NR and NMN might primarily be converted to nicotinamide, which is then transported and converted to NAD via the salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
*   **Intravenous (IV) Administration (Animal Studies)**: When given intravenously, both NR and NMN were able to directly produce NAD in the liver, kidney, and muscle in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. However, the only NAD detected in the brain was that salvaged from nicotinamide, suggesting that neither NR nor NMN cross the blood-brain barrier directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. IV NR produced more directly made NAD in the liver, kidney, and muscle compared to NMN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
*   **Direct NAD Injection**: Directly injecting NAD itself is also being explored. Oral NAD has poor bioavailability, being primarily digested into precursors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. While no mammalian NAD transporter has been identified, IV injection of NAD in mice raised NAD levels in some brain regions and the heart, offering protection from cardiac hypertrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

## Human Clinical Data

To date, there is no published evidence of oral nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. However, two randomized placebo-controlled trials have shown that oral nicotinamide riboside can increase NAD levels in white blood cells in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

*   **Study 1 (NR + Pterostilbene)**: An 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 120 healthy adults (ages 60-80) found that 250 mg daily of nicotinamide riboside plus pterostilbene (a sirtuin activator found in blueberries) increased whole blood NAD levels by 40% after four weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. A double dose (500 mg) increased NAD levels by 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. The lower dose group showed reduced diastolic blood pressure and lower levels of a liver damage marker (alanine aminotransferase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. It's unclear whether these effects were due to NR, pterostilbene, or both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   **Study 2 (NR Alone)**: Another randomized placebo-controlled trial with 60 middle-aged and older adults (ages 55-79) showed that a 500 mg dose of nicotinamide riboside twice daily (total 1 gram/day) for six weeks was well-tolerated and increased NAD levels in white blood cells by 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. Participants also experienced improvements in blood pressure and aortic stiffness, though these were not statistically significant, possibly due to dose size or small sample size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. NR had no effects on metabolic function, motor function, or exercise capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.

The highest dose tested in humans was 1 gram per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>, which is significantly lower than the human equivalent doses (2.6 grams/day) that showed benefits in animal studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. While short-term clinical studies indicate oral NR is safe, no long-term studies have been conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

## Conclusion

NAD is crucial for survival, energy metabolism, and DNA repair, but its levels decline with aging, leading to various health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. While lifestyle factors like exercise and fasting can increase NAD, [[effects_of_nad_boosters_and_their_impact_on_aging | NAD boosters]] like nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide offer another avenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>.

However, most promising data for [[effects_of_nad_boosters_and_their_impact_on_aging | NAD boosters]] comes from animal studies, often at very high doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. There are concerns about potential cancer acceleration in specific contexts and the bioavailability and direct tissue transport of these compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Human data is limited, primarily showing that NR can increase NAD levels in white blood cells in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

<div class="callout is-caution">
The effectiveness and long-term safety of these [[potential_health_benefits_and_risks_of_nad_supplementation | NAD boosters]] in humans remain open questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. Supplemental nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide can break down into nicotinamide, which may reduce sirtuin activation, especially in high humidity or heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Keeping products cold and sourcing from reputable manufacturers can help maintain their stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

Dr. Anna Patrick discusses [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide)]] and its related precursor molecules, Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These are often referred to as [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_nad_boosting_supplements | NAD boosters]] and are available as consumer supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is considered one of the most important molecules on the planet, vital for life to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Vital [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | Role of NAD]]

[[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels naturally decrease with [[role_of_nad_in_aging | age]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This decline is linked to many hallmarks of [[role_of_nad_in_aging | aging]], including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>:
*   Loss of proteostasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   [[micronutrients_and_mitochondrial_health | Mitochondrial dysfunction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   Glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Cellular senescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Altered epigenetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

[[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]]'s importance stems from its roles:
*   **[[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | Energy Metabolism]]**: [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is critical for [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | energy production]] in every tissue, including the brain, immune cells, and muscle tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It participates in redox reactions crucial for the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids and the formation of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **[[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | DNA Repair]]**: [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] promotes [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | DNA repair capacity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Its decline is associated with increased DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It is a cofactor for PARP1, an enzyme vital for [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | DNA repair]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. PARP1 activity is correlated with maximum lifespan in mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **[[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | Sirtuin Activity]]**: [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is required to activate [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | sirtuins]], a family of enzymes involved in healthspan and longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | Sirtuins]] use [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] for epigenetic regulation, controlling genes involved in [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | energy metabolism]], DNA repair, and cell survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

The decrease in [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels with [[role_of_nad_in_aging | age]] is not fully understood, but contributing factors include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>:
*   Increased chronic inflammation and immune activation, which consume [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   Increased need for [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | DNA repair]], placing demand on the [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Decreased ability to produce and recycle [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Sources of [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]]
[[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] can be synthesized from dietary sources like tryptophan and the three forms of niacin (Vitamin B3): nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide riboside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. However, the major source of [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] in the body is through a recycling mechanism called the [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, as dietary intake alone cannot meet the body's high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

In the salvage pathway, nicotinamide (a byproduct of [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] consumption) is converted into nicotinamide mononucleotide, and subsequently into [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Nicotinamide Riboside can also be converted into nicotinamide mononucleotide and then [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

A concern with the salvage pathway is that nicotinamide can inhibit [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | sirtuin]] activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Additionally, the enzyme that converts nicotinamide into nicotinamide mononucleotide is subject to feedback inhibition by [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, meaning at certain concentrations, nicotinamide will not be converted into [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

## [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_nad_boosting_supplements | NAD Boosters]]: Nicotinamide Riboside and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide

Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) are called [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_nad_boosting_supplements | NAD boosters]] because, in supplement form, they have been shown to be well tolerated at high doses, effectively raise [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels, and ameliorate [[effects_of_nad_levels_on_agerelated_diseases | age-associated diseases]] in rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Animal Studies on [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_nad_boosting_supplements | NAD Boosters]]

#### Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)
NR is the most extensively studied [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_nad_boosting_supplements | NAD booster]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Metabolic Health**: Oral NR at high doses can counteract an obesogenic diet by improving insulin sensitivity, endurance, and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Muscle & Mitochondria**: High-dose NR reversed [[micronutrients_and_mitochondrial_health | mitochondrial damage]], increased [[micronutrients_and_mitochondrial_health | mitochondrial biogenesis]], and reversed muscular atrophy in animals with severe muscle wasting disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Brain Health**: NR had positive effects on the brain in animals, increasing neurogenesis, decreasing cognitive deterioration, and improving synaptic plasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

#### Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)
NMN has also shown health benefits in animal studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>:
*   **Metabolic Health**: High-dose NMN injections countered an obesogenic diet and improved several markers of metabolic health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Heart & Brain**: Injections improved heart function in animals with cardiac problems and enhanced cognition and memory in animals with neurodegenerative disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_nad_in_aging | Aging]]**: Long-term dietary NMN mitigated [[role_of_nad_in_aging | age]]-associated physiological decline in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Benefits included improved skeletal muscle function, [[micronutrients_and_mitochondrial_health | mitochondrial function]], increased energy expenditure, increased bone density, and decreased insulin resistance, with effects being dose-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

#### A Concern: Cancer Growth
A recent study showed that NMN accelerated cancer growth in mice with a specific type of pancreatic cancer driven by pro-inflammatory senescent cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. High-dose NMN injections led to significant increases in precancerous and cancerous lesions in the pancreas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This effect was dependent on senescent cells, which can drive cancer progression over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] appears to increase the tumorigenic quality of senescent cells, likely by boosting their [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | energy metabolism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. While this doesn't mean NR or NMN cause cancer or drive progression in other cancer types, it highlights the need for long-term animal studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

### Translation to Humans: Challenges and Human Data

#### Dosing in Animal vs. Human Studies
Many rodent studies used very high oral doses of NR (e.g., 400 mg/kg body weight), which translates to a human equivalent dose of approximately 2.6 grams per day for a 180-pound person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This is a very high dose, not yet clinically tested in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

Most NMN animal studies used high injected doses (e.g., 500 mg/kg body weight), which are difficult to translate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. The long-term [[role_of_nad_in_aging | aging]] study with oral NMN used doses from 100-300 mg/kg body weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The lower dose (100 mg/kg) translates to about 653 mg/day for a 180-pound person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, while the higher, more robust dose (300 mg/kg) translates to about 2 grams per day, also a high dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

#### Bioavailability and Tissue Distribution
A key question is whether NR or NMN can reach other tissues intact and directly form [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] without going through the [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] recycling (salvage) pathway, which is subject to feedback inhibition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

An animal study using isotope tracers found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>:
*   At low oral doses (50 mg/kg) of NR or NMN, very low levels of directly made [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] were found only in the liver, not other tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Low levels of NR-derived [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] were found in kidneys, and very low levels in muscles and the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   A higher oral dose of NR (200 mg/kg) showed no difference in directly made [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] in tissues other than the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. However, more [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] from the salvage pathway was found in the kidney, muscle, and brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
*   When given intravenously, directly produced [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] was found in the liver, kidney, and muscle in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. The brain only showed salvaged [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]], suggesting NR and NMN don't directly cross the blood-brain barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

This implies that at currently measured oral doses, NR and NMN may be converted into nicotinamide, which is then transported and converted to [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] via the salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. However, at very high oral doses used in beneficial animal studies, it's possible direct transport or sufficient salvaged [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. Intravenous administration appears to bypass some of these limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

#### Human Clinical Studies
There is no published human evidence for oral NMN supplementation to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. However, two randomized placebo-controlled trials have shown that oral Nicotinamide Riboside can increase [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels in white blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>:
1.  **Study 1**: In 120 healthy adults (60-80 years old), a 250 mg daily dose of NR combined with pterostilbene (a sirtuin activator) increased whole blood [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels by 40% after four weeks, and 90% at a 500 mg dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. The lower dose group showed reduced diastolic blood pressure and lower levels of liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. It's unclear if NR, pterostilbene, or both were responsible for these effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
2.  **Study 2**: In 60 middle-aged and older adults (55-79 years old), a 500 mg dose of NR twice daily (1 gram total) for six weeks was well tolerated and increased [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels in white blood cells by 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. Participants also experienced non-statistically significant improvements in blood pressure and aortic stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. NR had no effects on metabolic function, motor function, or exercise capacity/performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

The highest dose tested in humans was 1 gram per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>, which is significantly lower than the human equivalent doses showing benefits in animal studies (e.g., 2.6 grams/day for NR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. Short-term clinical studies indicate oral NR is safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, but long-term studies are lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

### Supplement Stability
NR and NMN can break down into nicotinamide over time, especially in high humidity or heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. This is undesirable because supplemental nicotinamide may reduce [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | sirtuin]] activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. Keeping supplements cold helps maintain stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is crucial for survival, with the body primarily relying on recycling to meet its needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Normal [[role_of_nad_in_aging | aging]] and daily living can cause [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels to decline, leading to [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction]], and increased [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | DNA damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels can be increased through lifestyle choices like exercise and fasting, and by [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_nad_boosting_supplements | NAD boosters]] such as NR and NMN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.

While the data on [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_nad_boosting_supplements | NAD boosters]] is promising, primarily from animal studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>, their long-term effectiveness and safety in humans remain open questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. More research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

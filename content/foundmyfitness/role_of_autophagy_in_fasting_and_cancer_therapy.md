Valter Longo, a Professor of Gerontology and Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California and Director of the Longevity Institute, has extensively researched the effects of [[role_of_fasting_in_inflammation_gut_health_and_autophagy | fasting]] and diets on human aging, lifespan, healthspan biomarkers, and metabolic fasting therapies for treating human diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. His work includes significant contributions to understanding the [[autophagy_and_its_role_in_cell_biology | role of autophagy]] in these processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Fasting and Cellular Processes

[[caloric_restriction_fasting_and_nutrient_sensing_pathways | Fasting]], particularly periodic or [[fasting_as_a_treatment_for_cancer_and_multiple_sclerosis | fasting-mimicking diets]] (FMDs), represents a more extreme intervention compared to [[caloric_restriction_fasting_and_nutrient_sensing_pathways | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. These approaches are designed to manipulate the system and orchestrate genes to achieve outcomes like increased protection and the activation of [[stem_cell_regeneration_and_fasting | stem cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

One of the key cellular processes associated with fasting is [[autophagy_and_its_role_in_cell_biology | autophagy]], which involves the clearing away of damaged cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. During fasting, autophagy is clearly occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. However, the reduction in white blood cell populations during prolonged fasting (e.g., 48-72 hours in animals) is primarily attributed to apoptosis (programmed cell death) rather than solely autophagy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This process sheds unneeded cells, followed by a rebuilding of the system during the refeeding phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Autophagy and Cancer Therapy

[[cancer_treatment_and_fasting | Fasting]] and [[fasting_as_a_treatment_for_cancer_and_multiple_sclerosis | fasting-mimicking diets]] have shown significant potential in [[cancer_treatment_and_fasting | cancer therapy]] through mechanisms like differential stress resistance (protecting normal cells from chemotherapy) and differential stress sensitization (making cancer cells more susceptible to death) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

The concept of differential stress sensitization stems from the idea that normal cells enter a protected, "shielding" mode during starvation, making them resistant to toxins like chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Cancer cells, however, cannot respond in the same way due to their oncogenes regulating protection, rendering them unable to enter this mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### Cancer Cells and Metabolism

Cancer cells are often described as "dumb cells" because they are adapted to a high-nourishment environment with abundant proteins, amino acids, sugars, and growth factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. When these nutrients are removed through [[cancer_treatment_and_fasting | fasting]], cancer cells "starve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. This metabolic shift, known as the "fasting-dependent anti-Warburg effect," forces cancer cells to try and rely on oxidative phosphorylation using mitochondria for energy, a process they are not well-equipped for when glucose levels are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. This leads to the production of free radicals and an environment that can trigger their self-destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.

### Autophagy's Role in Cancer Cell Sensitivity

While [[autophagy_and_its_role_in_cell_biology | autophagy]] in normal cells is typically beneficial for clearing damaged components, in cancer cells during starvation, it appears to turn into something "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>. Research, including work by Guido Kroemer, suggests that [[autophagy_and_its_role_in_cell_biology | autophagy]] during starvation or with starvation-mimicking drugs is crucial for exposing cancer cells to the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. This process of weakening and potential death of cancer cells is part of their desperate attempt to acquire necessary components from within themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. Fasting removes the cancer cell's ability to "trick" the immune system by taking away protective mechanisms, making them more susceptible to immune attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

Fasting-mimicking drugs like resveratrol and spermidine are also believed to activate signaling pathways similar to those triggered by fasting, pushing cells in that direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>.

## Clinical Translation

Longo emphasizes that [[cancer_treatment_and_fasting | fasting]] combined with chemotherapy, rather than either intervention alone, has shown the most powerful effects, including cancer-free survival in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. This highlights the importance of combining traditional medicine with alternative/integrative medicine that has a deep scientific foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

Clinical trials involving [[fasting_as_a_treatment_for_cancer_and_multiple_sclerosis | fasting-mimicking diets]] have shown promising results in humans, including lowering markers of DNA damage in blood cells and sensitizing cancer cells to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. The practical challenges and safety concerns of prolonged fasting led to the development of the FMD, which is easier for patients and doctors to adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

The fasting-mimicking diet has been clinically tested and is available through L-Nutra, which produces a product called ProLon FMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. It is important for individuals, especially those with diseases or on medication, to consult a doctor before undertaking such interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>.

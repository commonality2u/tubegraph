Lutein and zeaxanthin are two important carotenoids found in various plant-based foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05">[03:05]</a>. They are highly concentrated in the retina of the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09">[03:09]</a>.

## Functions and Benefits

These carotenoids perform two critical functions in the eye:
*   **Filtering Singlet Oxygen** Lutein and zeaxanthin filter out singlet oxygen, which is produced by blue light from the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15">[03:15]</a>. This protects the rods and cones in the eye from damaging effects of blue light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21">[03:21]</a>.
*   **[[Antioxidant properties of astaxanthin in krill oil | Antioxidant]] Activity** They also possess [[Antioxidant properties of astaxanthin in krill oil | antioxidant]] activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25">[03:25]</a>. This property helps protect against several types of [[Role of micronutrients in preventing agerelated diseases | age-related macular degeneration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30">[03:30]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Visual Performance** In addition to protective roles, lutein and zeaxanthin have been shown to slightly enhance visual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36">[03:36]</a>.

## Dietary Sources

Kale is an excellent source of lutein and zeaxanthin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40">[03:40]</a>. A single [[Micronutrient and fiber importance | micronutrient]] smoothie, incorporating about eight kale leaves, can provide approximately 390 milligrams of both lutein and zeaxanthin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43">[03:43]</a>.

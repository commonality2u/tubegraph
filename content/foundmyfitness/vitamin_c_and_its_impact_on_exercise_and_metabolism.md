Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is an essential nutrient known for its antioxidant properties and its role as a cofactor in numerous physiological processes, including metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. While it can enhance exercise performance by mitigating the negative effects of excessive reactive oxygen species, there's a nuanced relationship where it might also influence beneficial training adaptations and metabolic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Vitamin C and Exercise Performance

During exercise, especially intense or prolonged activity, the body produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a consequence of metabolic processes and immune activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. While excessive exercise-induced ROS can lead to immune dysfunction, ROS also mediate beneficial training adaptations, such as increased mitochondrial number and function, improved insulin sensitivity, glucose utilization, and enhanced immune function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

Some studies suggest that Vitamin C supplementation can:
*   Decrease markers of muscle damage, such as [[creatine_effect_on_muscle_performance_and_recovery | creatine kinase activity]] and myoglobin concentrations, and reduce muscle soreness after exercise with doses ranging from 400 milligrams to 3 grams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.
*   Have no effect on physical adaptations to exercise when lower doses (200 milligrams to 1 gram per day) are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

However, when [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] is taken in combination with other [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | antioxidants]] like Vitamin E, it may blunt beneficial [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | cellular adaptations to exercise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. A study involving 54 young men and women showed that a combination of 1 gram of [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] and 235 milligrams of Vitamin E for 11 weeks decreased markers of mitochondrial biogenesis, which increased in the placebo group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.

The variability in findings can be attributed to:
*   Dose and duration of [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] supplementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.
*   Whether [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] is taken alone or with other [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | antioxidants]] like Vitamin E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.
*   Participants' physical fitness and baseline [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.

A study with 100 men found that those with low baseline [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] levels (around 35 micromoles per liter) had lower VO2 Max levels compared to those with high levels (around 78 micromoles per liter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Supplementation in the low-level group showed reduced biomarkers of oxidative stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

## Vitamin C and Insulin Sensitivity

[[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | Exercise]] rapidly improves the body's ability to take up and utilize glucose, leading to improved insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. Some studies suggest that taking [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] with other supplemental [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | antioxidants]] might attenuate these beneficial effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

For instance, a study of 40 men found that 500 milligrams of [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] twice a day with 400 IU's of Vitamin E reduced insulin sensitivity compared to a placebo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. This suggests that the exercise-induced improvement in insulin sensitivity occurred only in the absence of [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | antioxidants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. Conversely, another study with 21 physically active men showed no effect of [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | antioxidant]] supplementation on insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. These discrepancies may be due to the dose, duration, and timing of supplementation relative to [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | exercise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. Sustaining [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] plasma levels through multiple daily doses could potentially blunt [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | exercise]]-mediated improvements in insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>.

## Vitamin C and Exercise-Induced Immune Function

Frequent moderate to [[vigorous_exercise_and_metabolic_adaptations | vigorous acute exercise]] sessions (about an hour) can boost the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. However, repeated high-intensity training or endurance activities like long-distance running can diminish it due to [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | exercise]]-induced oxidative stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. Some research suggests that [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] alone or in combination with Vitamin E may increase immune cell function and oxidative capacity to protect against [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | exercise]]-induced immune dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.

For endurance athletes, [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] supplementation appears more promising:
*   A meta-analysis of six trials involving over 600 marathon runners, skiers, and soldiers reported 50% fewer colds among those who took supplemental [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.
*   [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] doses of 150-900 milligrams per day, particularly with Vitamin E and beta carotene, have been shown to enhance neutrophil function and reduce [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | exercise]]-induced oxidative damage in lymphocytes of trained runners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

The effectiveness of [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] for [[exercise and cardiovascular health | exercise]]-induced immune support depends on factors like [[vigorous_exercise_and_metabolic_adaptations | exercise]] intensity, duration, frequency, and whether other [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | antioxidants]] are co-administered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

## Vitamin C and Fatty Acid Oxidation

[[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] influences fatty acid oxidation, a mechanism for utilizing fat as an energy source, often referred to as "fat burning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.
*   [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] levels are inversely correlated with body fat, especially in obese individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.
*   It is essential for the synthesis of carnitine, which plays a crucial role in fatty acid utilization for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.
*   Mouse studies have shown that [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] reduced weight gain (particularly fat mass) in mice fed a high-fat, high-sugar Western diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. It also increased levels of PPAR alpha, a protein that regulates fat metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.
*   A clinical study with 22 men and women found that fat utilization during [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | exercise]] was 25% lower in individuals with marginal [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. After four weeks of [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] supplementation (500 mg/day), fatty acid utilization was approximately four times greater in the supplemented group compared to the depleted group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>.

These findings suggest that a higher [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] status may be necessary for effective fat utilization and weight management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.

Overall, the relationship between [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]], [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | exercise]], and metabolism is complex, with varying outcomes depending on factors such as dose, duration, presence of other [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | antioxidants]], and individual baseline [[role_of_vitanmins_and_minerals_in_metabolism | Vitamin C]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. Further research with consistent and well-designed studies is needed to fully elucidate its potential in benefiting human health in these contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:49">[01:15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.

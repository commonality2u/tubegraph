Dr. Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology and Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California and Director of the Longevity Institute, has extensively researched the effects of fasting and specialized diets on human aging, lifespan, and biomarkers of health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. His work focuses on interventions that safely extend longevity, particularly periodic fasting or [[Fastingmimicking diets | fasting-mimicking diets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

## Fasting vs. Calorie Restriction

Dr. Longo distinguishes periodic fasting from traditional calorie restriction, which involves permanent caloric reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Unlike calorie restriction, which primarily involves eating less constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, fasting is a more extreme intervention designed to "orchestrate a lot of genes to get it to do things like increase protection... or turn on [[the_role_of_stem_cells_in_regenerative_medicine | stem cells]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. Many of these effects cannot be achieved through calorie restriction alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

A crucial component of periodic fasting is the refeeding period, which is largely absent in continuous calorie restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. While [[the_role_of_stem_cells_in_regenerative_medicine | stem cells]] are activated during fasting, it is the refeeding that drives the rebuilding of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. This coordinated effect, based on cycles of fasting and refeeding, is highly powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

## Stem Cell Regeneration in Animals

Dr. Longo's research in animals, particularly with prolonged fasting (48 to 72 hours), demonstrated significant effects on the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. During fasting, populations of white blood cells decrease, not primarily due to [[role_of_autophagy_in_fasting_and_cancer_therapy | autophagy]], but through apoptosis (programmed cell death) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. For instance, in a mouse, approximately 40% of white blood cells are destroyed during four days of fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. This reduction is then followed by a rebuilding phase during refeeding, where the 40% is restored within a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

This process represents "the most powerful regeneration or generation program that you have since birth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>, as it allows organs like the liver, immune system, and others to shrink and then regenerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Fasting acts as a signal for the body to eliminate old or damaged cells, and refeeding prompts the rebuilding of new systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

## Implications for Human Aging and Disease

The findings have significant implications for human aging, particularly in addressing immunosenescence, the age-related decline of the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.
In studies with older mice, fasting caused the number of lymphocytes to return to more youthful levels, and the ratio of myeloid cells to lymphocytes shifted towards a younger profile, indicating a [[the_role_of_stem_cells_in_regenerative_medicine | rejuvenation]] of the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. This rebalancing could impact susceptibility to infections and [[Cancer treatment and fasting | cancer]] in older individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

### Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD) for Human Application

Recognizing the difficulty and safety concerns of prolonged water-only fasting for humans, Dr. Longo developed the [[Fastingmimicking diets | fasting-mimicking diet]] (FMD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. This diet is typically low in protein and sugar, and high in healthy fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, designed to "trick the system" into a fasting state while still allowing consumption of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

Clinical studies with the [[Fastingmimicking diets | FMD]] have shown promising results:
*   **Inflammation:** A decrease in inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein in both mice and humans (aged 20 to 70) with high baseline levels, bringing them back to normal after three cycles of FMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. This suggests a reset of the system to a more youthful state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.
*   **Organ Regeneration:** Organs like the liver undergo cycles of atrophy and regeneration, contributing to reduced inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.
*   [[Fasting as a treatment for cancer and multiple sclerosis | **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**]]: In mouse models of MS, the [[Fastingmimicking diets | FMD]] led to the destruction of autoimmune white blood cells, followed by the activation of [[the_role_of_stem_cells_in_regenerative_medicine | stem cells]] to generate new, non-autoimmune cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>. It also reduced inflammation around the spinal cord, enabling progenitor cells to rebuild myelin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:13:00">[43:13:00]</a>. A clinical trial showed that a single week of FMD followed by a Mediterranean diet yielded better results than six months of a continuous ketogenic diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:05:00">[45:05:00]</a>.
*   **Muscle Mass:** The [[Fastingmimicking diets | FMD]] causes a temporary loss of muscle mass, but it is rebuilt during refeeding, leading to a specific loss of visceral fat with minimal overall lean body mass reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:11]</a>.

The FMD pushes the body into a ketogenic mode, burning visceral fat as a primary energy source, and shifting the brain from sugar to ketone bodies like beta-hydroxybutyrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27:00">[40:27:00]</a>. This metabolic shift supports the shrinking and rebuilding of systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>. While daily [[Intermittent fasting and metabolic switching | intermittent fasting]] (e.g., 14 hours) offers some benefits, it typically doesn't induce the profound shrinking and rebuilding seen with prolonged FMD, as the body can rely on glycogen stores for a significant portion of that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:52:00">[39:52:00]</a>.

Dr. Longo believes that these types of interventions, which allow the body to self-repair, could become standard medical practice in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>.

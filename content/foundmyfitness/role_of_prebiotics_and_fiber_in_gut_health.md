Fiber, particularly a diverse range of types, is highly beneficial and often lacking in modern diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, with estimates suggesting traditional hunter-gatherer societies consumed approximately ten times more fiber than people do today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Fiber and the Gut Microbiome
Many types of fiber are fermentable by the microorganisms comprising the [[importance_of_gut_microbiota_in_overall_health | gut microbiome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. These fermentable fiber types are known as [[role_of_probiotics_and_prebiotics | prebiotics]] because they nourish beneficial gut bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Eating a wide variety of fermentable [[impact_of_fiber_types_on_gut_health | fiber types]] is the most effective way to enhance microbial diversity in the gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This can be achieved by consuming a diverse range of vegetables and fruits, which offer various [[role_of_probiotics_and_prebiotics | prebiotics]] that feed different microbial species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### Specific Prebiotics
Certain ingredients contribute specific [[role_of_probiotics_and_prebiotics | prebiotics]] beneficial for gut health:
*   **Pectin** Apples and berries provide a good source of the prebiotic pectin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Sulfoquinovose** Green leafy vegetables contain the prebiotic sulfoquinovose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

Both pectin and sulfoquinovose support various beneficial gut bacteria, contributing to [[importance_of_gut_microbiota_in_overall_health | gut health]] protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Non-Fermentable Fiber
In addition to fermentable types, vegetables also provide non-fermentable [[impact_of_fiber_types_on_gut_health | fiber types]] like lignins and cellulose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. These are found in plant cell walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. While they do not feed gut bacteria, they play a beneficial role by facilitating the movement of food and waste through the digestive tract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Recommended Fiber Intake
The Mayo Clinic suggests a daily fiber intake of at least 38 grams for men and 25 grams for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This is significantly more than the estimated 10 grams per day consumed by Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, and well below the 100 to 150 grams of fiber per day consumed by modern-day Tanzanian hunter-gatherer societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Importance of Whole Foods
Using a high-powered food processor or blender is preferred over a juicer because juicing removes the fiber content from fruits and vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Consuming the whole plant, as in a smoothie, ensures that the beneficial fiber is retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

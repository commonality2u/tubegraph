Flavonoids are compounds produced by most plants, known for their significant [[role_of_antioxidants_in_the_body | antioxidant]] activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. These plant phytochemicals contribute to [[health_benefits_of_flavonoids | health benefits]] by protecting cells from various forms of damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Fruit Sources of Flavonoids
Certain fruits are particularly rich in specific types of flavonoids:
*   **Apples**: The peel of an apple contains quercetin and epicatechin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Blueberries**: These berries are very high in anthocyanins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Antioxidant Mechanisms
Flavonoids offer protection through several key mechanisms:
*   **Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Sequestration**: They are highly potent at sequestering reactive oxygen species produced within cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cellular Protection**: By neutralizing ROS, flavonoids protect cells from damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This protection is crucial in preventing diseases associated with aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Enzyme Activation**: Flavonoids activate Phase two detoxification enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. These enzymes play a role in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Inflammation Reduction**: They help lower inflammation by inhibiting genes that activate inflammatory responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

These general mechanisms illustrate how flavonoids contribute to lowering oxidation and inflammation within the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

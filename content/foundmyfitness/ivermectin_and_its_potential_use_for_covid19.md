Ivermectin is a medication that was initially studied for its potential use against SARS-CoV-2 in June 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:36">[01:22:36]</a>. In laboratory settings (in vitro), it was found that at a high concentration (5 micromolar), ivermectin could significantly reduce the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to reproduce by about 5,000-fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:43">[01:22:43]</a>. This discovery generated excitement about potentially repurposing ivermectin, which has been used for years as an anti-parasitic medication, particularly in South America and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">[01:23:06]</a>.

## Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy Concerns

However, a study published in the *British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology* indicated that the free plasma concentration of ivermectin in humans, when given at actual doses (about 0.28 micromolar), is approximately 250 times lower than the concentration required to reduce viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.

A meta-analysis published in June 2021, titled "Ivermectin for Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Trial Sequential Analysis to Inform Clinical Guidelines," examined up to 25 different studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:12">[01:24:12]</a>. This meta-analysis concluded there was "moderate certainty of evidence that there was a reduction in death compared with no ivermectin," but the certainty for other conclusions was very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:38">[01:24:38]</a>. It's important to note that this meta-analysis included a randomized controlled trial that was later retracted due to suspected fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:56">[01:24:56]</a>. The authors of the meta-analysis stated that this retraction would not have changed the overall conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>.

## Confounding Factors in Studies

Many studies on ivermectin were conducted outside the United States, in regions where clinically silent parasitic infections can be prevalent (approaching 50% to 60% in some studies in places like Egypt, the Middle East, and South America) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:19">[01:25:19]</a>. When patients with COVID-19 in these regions receive treatments like high doses of dexamethasone, which is an immunosuppressant, it's possible that these parasitic infections could become reactivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>. In such scenarios, adding ivermectin might be beneficial, not necessarily by directly treating COVID-19, but by suppressing these co-existing parasitic infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:10">[01:26:10]</a>. This represents a significant confounding factor when interpreting the efficacy of ivermectin specifically for COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>.

Additional problems with many studies on ivermectin include varying co-treatments (e.g., ivermectin alone vs. ivermectin plus azithromycin, or [[role_of_vitamin_c_and_melatonin_in_covid19 | vitamin C and zinc]], or blood thinners), small sample sizes, and inconsistent clinical endpoints (e.g., hospitalization, death, viral clearance time) being aggregated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a>.

## Current Research and Perspective

Randomized controlled trials within the United States, focusing on the U.S. population, are needed to determine ivermectin's efficacy for COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:31">[01:26:31]</a>. Several studies are currently underway, including those at Temple University in Philadelphia, McMaster University, and the Together Trial in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>. The Together Trial, a platform designed to rapidly assess repurposed medications, has stopped studies on [[hydroxychloroquine_as_a_covid19_treatment | hydroxychloroquine]] and lopinavir-ritonavir due to lack of improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:02">[01:27:02]</a>. While they are still looking at ivermectin (single and three doses), they are also studying fluvoxamine, an antidepressant with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant claims, which has shown an even better signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>.

It is considered dangerous to use veterinary forms of ivermectin, often referred to as "horse dewormer," due to vastly different doses involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:18">[01:36:18]</a>.

While there may be a "small signal" or a "little bit of a signal" for ivermectin, particularly in speeding up viral clearance, it is not a "huge, huge effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:06">[01:35:06]</a>. There is no evidence to support claims that ivermectin is "as good as vaccines at protecting against COVID-19" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Furthermore, current meta-analyses and data on ivermectin do not specifically address its effects on the Delta variant, which became dominant later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:18">[01:40:18]</a>.

From a medical perspective, treatments like ivermectin represent "one slice in the large slices of cheese" within the "Swiss cheese model" of protection against infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:13">[01:20:13]</a>. This model emphasizes multiple layers of protection, such as vaccines, masks, and lifestyle factors like [[vitamin_d_and_its_impact_on_covid19 | Vitamin D]], sleep, and exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:36">[01:20:36]</a>. Relying solely on one measure, such as a potential treatment, is not how medical thinking operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>. [[covid19_vaccines_and_efficacy | COVID-19 vaccines and efficacy]] are known from large-scale randomized controlled trials and real-world data from billions of people worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:31">[01:39:31]</a>.

Dr. Valter Longo, a Professor of Gerontology and Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California and Director of the Longevity Institute, has made significant contributions to understanding the effects of fasting and other diets on human aging, lifespan, and health span biomarkers, as well as their role in metabolic fasting therapies for human diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Fasting vs. Calorie Restriction
Longo's research focuses on periodic fasting, and more specifically, [[Fastingmimicking diets | fasting-mimicking diets]] (FMDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These diets are designed to "trick the system" into thinking it is fasting while still allowing food consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The concept emerged as an alternative to permanent [[Calorie restriction and intermittent fasting | calorie restriction]], which Longo observed to be difficult and stressful for individuals, as seen in early human studies like Biosphere 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

[[Calorie restriction and intermittent fasting | Calorie restriction]] involves a continuous 20% to 30% reduction in calories, whereas periodic fasting and FMDs are more extreme interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. These extreme interventions manipulate the system to orchestrate gene expression, increasing protection and activating [[Stem cell regeneration and fasting | stem cells]], effects not typically achieved through [[Calorie restriction and intermittent fasting | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

A key difference is the role of refeeding. While the fasting period initiates processes, the refeeding phase is crucial for rebuilding the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. For example, [[Stem cell regeneration and fasting | stem cells]] are activated during fasting, but their rebuilding function occurs during refeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This coordinated cycle of fasting and refeeding drives the benefits seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Fasting-Mimicking Diets (FMDs)
The [[Fastingmimicking diets | fasting-mimicking diet]] typically consists of a period of four days to one week or longer, characterized by being low in protein, low in sugar, and high in good fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This approach was developed to improve compliance and safety for human application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Giving patients a "box" of pre-packaged foods makes it feel more like a medicine, increasing adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

Longo believes that within 10 years, these types of interventions could become standard practice in doctors' offices worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

### Effects on Inflammation
FMDs have shown to decrease inflammation. In mice, FMD reduced inflammation in middle-aged subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. In a human clinical study (ages 20-70), patients with high C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation) saw their levels return to normal after three cycles of FMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This reduction in inflammation is seen as an indicator that the body's systems are being reset to a more youthful state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Fasting and Cancer Treatment
Fasting, particularly prolonged fasting or FMDs, has shown powerful effects in [[Cancer treatment and fasting | cancer treatment]] by inducing differential stress resistance (DSR) and differential stress sensitization (DSS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

*   **Differential Stress Resistance (DSR)**: Normal cells, when starved, enter a protected, "shielding" mode, making them resistant to various toxins, including chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Differential Stress Sensitization (DSS)**: Cancer cells, by definition, cannot respond to starvation by entering this protected mode due to their oncogenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. They are "dumb" cells that have evolved in an environment of abundance, relying on high levels of nutrients like proteins, amino acids, sugars, and growth factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. When these nutrients are withdrawn, cancer cells become "miserable" and vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

### Mechanisms in Cancer Therapy
1.  **Anti-Warburg Effect**: Fasting lowers glucose levels, forcing cancer cells to shift from relying on glucose (the Warburg effect) to oxidative phosphorylation, using mitochondria for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. This process makes them desperate and produces high levels of free radicals, leading to cell suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
2.  **Immune System Modulation**: Fasting can also make cancer cells more immunogenic, making them easier for the immune system (e.g., cytotoxic T lymphocytes) to recognize and kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Longo notes that fasting causes a coordinated multi-level approach, potentially evolved to get rid of precancerous cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
3.  [[Role of autophagy in fasting and cancer therapy | Autophagy]]: While Longo notes apoptosis (programmed cell death) is primarily responsible for the reduction in white blood cells during fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, [[Role of autophagy in fasting and cancer therapy | autophagy]] is also clearly occurring and may contribute to the weakening and death of cancer cells by breaking down needed components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.

In mouse studies, combining starvation or FMDs with chemotherapy resulted in cancer-free survival, an outcome rarely seen when either intervention was used alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. This suggests that combining traditional medicine with scientifically grounded alternative/integrative medicine can create a powerful therapeutic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

## Fasting and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Treatment
Research on FMDs and MS has been conducted in both mice and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

### Mechanisms in MS Therapy
1.  **Immune System Rejuvenation**: FMD causes the destruction of autoimmune white blood cells, followed by the activation of [[Stem cell regeneration and fasting | stem cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. The newly generated immune cells are no longer autoimmune, preventing attacks on oligodendrocytes (cells that produce myelin) in the spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.
2.  **Reduced Inflammation**: The general inflammatory state, particularly around the spinal cord, decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>. This allows progenitor cells to regenerate new myelin, rebuilding the spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>.
3.  **Metabolic Switching**: By day two of an FMD, the body switches to a ketogenic mode, burning visceral fat as a primary energy source, and the brain shifts to burning ketone bodies like beta-hydroxybutyrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>. This shrinking and rebuilding of organs, including the immune system, liver, heart, and oligodendrocytes, is unique to prolonged fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

In a human study for MS, a single week of FMD, followed by a regular Mediterranean diet for six months, showed better outcomes than six months of a continuous ketogenic diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. This remarkable finding highlights the potency of periodic FMD interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.

## Practical Application and Availability
For individuals interested in FMD for disease treatment, Valter Longo founded a company called L-Nutra (l-nutra.com), which produces a product called ProLon FMD (fmd.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. This product is being clinically tested and doctors are now recommending it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>.

*   **Consultation**: Patients are advised to contact L-Nutra and seek clearance from their doctor, especially if they have existing diseases or are taking medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>.
*   **Support**: Users typically get assigned a nutritionist or dietitian to guide them through the five-day program from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.

> "If you can wait, wait. If you cannot wait because, you know, you have multiple sclerosis, and you cannot take it anymore, or you have cancer, and you're stage four, or even you're stage one and you're getting devastated by the side effects, so go to your oncologist, your cardiologist, your diabetologist, your immunologist, whatever, and say, 'I can't take this anymore. This is not working.'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>

Longo stresses that these are powerful interventions that must be respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. He does not receive any salary or consulting fees from the company, and his shares are donated to a foundation, ensuring that his advice is not monetarily driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Future Outlook
Fasting is seen not as a stress, but as a normal and evolutionarily common environment for organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. Organisms have "program A" (starvation/shielded mode for long-term protection) and "program B" (growth/reproduction when food is abundant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. The environment dictates which program is adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.

This perspective influences Longo's approach to diet and longevity. He practices a flexible approach, noting that for those who are overweight or obese, two meals a day might be appropriate, while underweight individuals should return to three meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of making dietary changes manageable for compliance, suggesting that simple rules like time-restricted eating (e.g., within a 12-hour window) or skipping meals are more sustainable than highly restrictive, complex diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

Fasting, particularly FMD, also contributes to beneficial body composition changes by targeting visceral fat loss while preserving or rebuilding lean body mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. This makes it of interest to athletes who aim to increase lean muscle mass and decrease fat mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>.

The cyclical nature of fasting and refeeding drives [[Stem cell regeneration and fasting | stem cell regeneration and fasting]], which is crucial for rebuilding and rejuvenating various organ systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Longo notes that the body's inherent ability to fix itself, when prompted by fasting, is profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.

> [Valter]: "The fasting just tells the body, 'I need you to kill all these cells,' and then, the refeeding gives the message, 'I need you to rebuild all the systems cells.'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>

This understanding forms the basis for his laboratory's strategy to quickly translate mechanistic insights into clinical trials, prioritizing interventions for people who need solutions now, rather than waiting decades for every step of the mechanism to be fully elucidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.

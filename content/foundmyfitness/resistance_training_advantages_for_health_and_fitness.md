Resistance training is considered an indispensable form of exercise, offering benefits that extend beyond those provided by [[exercise_and_heart_health | cardiovascular exercise]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. It plays a crucial role in improving [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | muscle strength]], [[effects_of_resistance_training_on_bone_density | bone density]], and posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Unlike [[exercise_and_heart_health | aerobic exercise]], which has minimal effects on [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | strength levels]], muscle development, or [[effects_of_resistance_training_on_bone_density | bone development]], resistance training directly addresses these aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

If sedentary, individuals will lose muscle and experience deteriorating posture over time, which [[exercise_and_heart_health | aerobic training]] cannot prevent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Key Advantages of Resistance Training

### Bone Density and Osteoporosis Prevention
Resistance training is the primary way to strengthen bones, particularly important for preventing osteoporosis, a condition characterized by porous bones that degrade over time, especially in sedentary individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Women are disproportionately affected by osteoporosis, accounting for 80% of cases, due to starting with less bone mass and the osteoprotective effects of estrogen being lost post-menopause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

Muscle pulling on bones during [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | strength training]] directly strengthens the bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. While any type of resistance training strengthens bones, [[effects_of_resistance_training_on_bone_density | weight-bearing exercise]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Activities like cycling, elliptical machines, or swimming are not sufficiently [[effects_of_resistance_training_on_bone_density | weight-bearing]] to have substantial effects on bone development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

*   **Optimizing Bone Development**
    *   Most research uses moderate to heavier loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
    *   Training with a good deal of effort and high levels of intensity is likely to achieve similar effects even with lighter loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   Focusing on multi-joint movements like squats, rows, and presses, which utilize more than one joint, can provide better overall effects on bone density due to the imposed loading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:07:05]</a>. Dumbbells can be used for multi-joint movements like shoulder presses, chest presses, and goblet squats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   Regular and consistent resistance training profoundly staves off osteoporosis and can even build bones, especially when younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Muscle Mass and Aging (Sarcopenia)
It is never too late to start resistance training to build muscle mass or prevent age-related muscle atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Studies on individuals aged 70 and above have shown profound improvements in muscle strength and [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | muscle hypertrophy]] within 8 to 12-week training programs, even for novice trainees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

While improvements can always be made, starting resistance training at a younger age (teens and twenties) is always better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This is because, like building a "bone bank," starting early allows for building a "muscle reserve" that can be maintained as aging naturally leads to muscle loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

*   **Children and Youth**
    *   Resistance training is safe and beneficial for children as young as six, seven, or eight years old, provided it is done in a fully supervised environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.
    *   The myth that it stunts growth is unfounded; there is zero evidence to support this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.
    *   Making the training fun for children is crucial to prevent aversion to exercise later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a>.
    *   Benefits for children include improved self-esteem, reduced bullying, and becoming better athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>.

### Body Composition and Weight Loss
Resistance training significantly improves lean mass (largely muscle mass) and aids in fat loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>. While [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]] alone is not the most efficient way to lose body fat due to the high energy expenditure required compared to dietary restriction, it is a crucial adjunct to a fat-loss program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.

*   **Muscle Preservation during Weight Loss**
    *   Combining resistance training with an energy deficit through nutritional restriction is fundamental for weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>.
    *   Without lifting weights, even with cardio, 25% to 30% of weight loss can come from muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.
    *   Resistance training not only preserves fat-free mass but can facilitate "recomposition" (gaining muscle while losing fat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:24">[01:20:24]</a>.
    *   Recomposition is easier for individuals with more weight to lose and for novice trainees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:54">[01:20:54]</a>. However, maximizing muscle mass gain typically requires being at maintenance calories or in a small surplus, which may involve gaining some fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>.

*   **Protein Intake for Muscle Preservation**
    *   Sufficient protein intake is crucial for preserving lean mass during a caloric deficit, even without resistance training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a>.
    *   However, if you're not lifting weights, you will still lose muscle (unless you are severely obese) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
    *   Even with weightlifting, insufficient protein will result in muscle loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:40">[01:23:40]</a>.
    *   Protein needs increase when in a caloric deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.
    *   **Protein Recommendations:**
        *   For resistance-training individuals: 1.6 to 1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day (roughly double the RDA for sedentary individuals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>.
        *   Upper confidence interval/safe side: 2.2 grams per kilogram per day (about 1 gram per pound in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>. This is especially important in a caloric deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>.
        *   Obese or overweight individuals should calculate protein intake based on their targeted lean weight, not their current weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>.
        *   Protein is difficult to store as body fat, making it a good macronutrient to prioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a>.
    *   **Leucine Threshold:** Older individuals may need higher per-dose protein intake (e.g., 3 grams of leucine) to kick-start [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | muscle growth]] due to anabolic resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>. Animal-based proteins (meat, milk, eggs) are rich in leucine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>.

### Strength and Hypertrophy
Traditional dogma that only heavy lifting (e.g., over 12-15 repetitions is "glorified cardio") has been compellingly debunked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:16">[01:46:16]</a>. Research now shows that similar amounts of muscle can be gained regardless of the load, across a wide range of repetition spectrums, even up to 30 to 40 repetitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:42">[01:46:42]</a>.

*   **Importance of Effort:** Lighter loads must be taken with a high degree of effort, meaning the last few repetitions are difficult to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:26">[01:49:26]</a>. If muscles are not extensively challenged beyond their present capacity, there is no impetus for adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:26">[01:50:26]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Flexibility:** The ability to achieve [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | muscle growth]] with lighter loads offers flexibility in training, particularly beneficial for individuals training through injuries or older adults with joint-related issues, where heavy loading might be contraindicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.
*   **Muscle Fiber Types:** [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | Sarcopenia]] (age-related muscle loss) is most specific to type-2 (strength-related) muscle fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:56">[01:51:56]</a>. Type-1 fibers are endurance-oriented, while type-2 fibers produce greater force but fatigue more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:07">[01:52:07]</a>. Training hard, regardless of heavy or light loads, targets both type-1 and type-2 fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:18">[01:53:18]</a>.

### Power Training
[[power_training | Power]] is the ability to produce force quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:51">[01:55:51]</a>. It is developed on a foundation of strength but also involves a time component, requiring some training to be done explosively (moving weights quickly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>.

*   **Importance for Older Individuals:** Incorporating [[power_training | power training]] (e.g., moving concentric action quickly with controlled eccentric) is important for older individuals to improve functional capacity, such as avoiding falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:23">[01:56:23]</a>. Hip fractures in older individuals often lead to significant functional loss or even mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:02">[01:57:02]</a>.
*   **Methods:** For power training, weights should be relatively light (e.g., enabling 8-10 repetitions) to allow for quick movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:13">[01:59:13]</a>. Plyometric training or medicine ball throws are also examples of power training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.

### Training Principles
*   **Training to Failure:** Training to the point of inability to perform another repetition with proper form (failure) is not always necessary for [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | hypertrophy]] and may even be detrimental to strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.
    *   Most sets should be within 1 to 3 repetitions in reserve (RIR) to promote optimal adaptations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.
    *   For the general population, training to failure is likely not necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. For high-level athletes or bodybuilders, some failure training (e.g., on the last set of some exercises) might be beneficial, especially with single-joint or machine-based exercises to minimize injury risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Volume (Sets per Muscle per Week):**
    *   Volume is a driver of [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | hypertrophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.
    *   To optimize hypertrophy, aim for 10 to 20 sets per muscle per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.
    *   The minimal effective dose is roughly 4 sets per muscle per week, which can yield good results for most people with 2-3 half-hour sessions per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:10:10]</a>.
*   **Time-Efficient Strategies:**
    *   Using multi-joint exercises (e.g., presses, rows, squats, deadlifts, push-ups, chin-ups) is more time-efficient as they involve multiple muscle groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.
    *   Advanced training methods like supersets (two different exercises performed consecutively) or paired sets (agonist/antagonist movements, or lower/upper body) save time by reducing rest intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
    *   Drop sets (performing a set to near failure, then immediately reducing the load and continuing with more reps) can also be time-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.
*   **Rest Intervals between Sets:**
    *   Longer rest intervals (e.g., 2-3 minutes) allow for greater volume load (total amount of weight lifted) in a session compared to shorter rests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.
    *   Short rest periods (e.g., 30-60 seconds), while thought to maximize hormonal response, actually compromise hypertrophy by reducing volume load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>. The total daily protein intake is more important than the timing or hormonal spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:27">[01:40:27]</a>.

### Concurrent Training (Aerobic and Resistance)
Combining [[exercise_and_heart_health | aerobic exercise]] and resistance training (concurrent training) is generally not detrimental to [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | muscle hypertrophy]] as once thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>.

*   **Recommendations:**
    *   If possible, space out sessions (e.g., resistance training on Mon/Wed/Fri, [[exercise_and_heart_health | aerobic training]] on Tue/Thu/Sat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:57">[01:38:57]</a>.
    *   If on the same day, separate them into morning and evening sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>.
    *   If in the same session, always perform resistance training first, as [[exercise_and_heart_health | aerobic training]] can compromise strength performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:23">[01:39:23]</a>.
    *   The type and volume of [[exercise_and_heart_health | aerobic training]] matter: walking or 3 [[benefits_of_highintensity_interval_training | HIIT]] sessions per week are unlikely to negatively affect muscle development, but high-volume marathon training will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:54">[01:39:54]</a>.
    *   For endurance athletes, focus on lower-volume, heavier-load resistance training (e.g., 3-5 reps for a few sets) to maximize strength development without substantially increasing muscle mass, which could hinder endurance performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:15">[01:42:15]</a>.

### Recovery
Recovery means taking sufficient time to return to training effectively with adequate energy and joint reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:26">[01:19:26]</a>.

*   **Factors Influencing Recovery:**
    *   **Active Recovery:** Being recreationally active and promoting blood flow (e.g., walking) helps optimize nutrient delivery and expedite recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>.
    *   **Nutrition:** Sufficient protein intake is fundamental for muscle tissue repair and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:03">[01:26:03]</a>. Omega-3 fatty acids may also have beneficial effects on muscle development, especially in older people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>.
    *   **Massage and Foam Rolling:** While perceived as helpful, it's hard to definitively prove benefits beyond psychological effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:26">[01:25:26]</a>.
    *   **Cold-Water Immersion (Cryotherapy):**
        *   May reduce soreness and expedite subjective recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>.
        *   However, emerging evidence suggests frequent use of cold-water immersion post-training can have negative effects on [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | hypertrophy]] and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>. It blunts intracellular anabolic signaling, muscle protein synthesis, and the beneficial acute pro-inflammatory response necessary for muscle development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>. It also restricts circulation, impeding nutrient delivery to muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:48">[01:29:48]</a>.
        *   Occasional use for soreness is likely fine, but frequent use, especially immediately post-training, is not recommended for optimizing [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | muscle growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:58">[01:28:58]</a>.
    *   **Soreness:**
        *   Soreness is often due to novel stimuli or eccentric (lengthening under tension) components of exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>.
        *   It is not necessary to be sore to make gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:22">[01:32:22]</a>.
        *   Mild soreness may indicate a novel challenge to the body and potential positive gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:35">[01:32:35]</a>.
        *   Excessive soreness is negative as it impairs the ability to train hard again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>.
        *   Warm-water baths and active recovery (e.g., walking, light movements) can help alleviate soreness by promoting blood flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>.

### Stretching and Flexibility
*   **Purpose:** Stretching is beneficial if increased flexibility is needed; otherwise, it's not inherently necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:44">[01:43:44]</a>. Gaining excessive flexibility beyond functional needs can reduce joint stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a>.
*   **Resistance Training for Flexibility:** Resistance training performed through a full range of motion offers similar flexibility benefits to static stretching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>. Combining resistance training with static stretching can further enhance flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:08">[01:45:08]</a>.
*   **Impact on Hypertrophy:** Long-duration, intense stretching (e.g., an hour a day with a stretching boot) can lead to significant [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | muscle hypertrophy]], as muscle tension is a mechanism of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:28">[01:45:28]</a>. Inter-set loaded stretching (stretching with weight during rest intervals) has also shown to promote greater gains in some muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:33">[01:46:33]</a>.
*   **Yoga:** While some forms of yoga can build muscle, it's generally not optimized for long-term [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | muscle growth]] as it may not sufficiently challenge muscles over time for continued adaptation. It's best used as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, dedicated resistance training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:16">[01:48:16]</a>.

### Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) Training
[[blood_flow_restriction_training | BFR training]] involves using a cuff placed proximally (upper portion) on arms or legs while performing exercises with very light loads (20-30% 1RM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>.

*   **Benefits:** It causes faster muscle fatigue and promotes similar [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | muscle development]] to traditional resistance training, regardless of rep range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:38">[01:51:38]</a>. It's beneficial for reducing joint stress while still providing a challenge, and can reduce discomfort compared to conventional light-load training due to shorter set durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:15">[01:53:15]</a>.
*   **Limitations and Caveats:**
    *   Can only be used on arms and legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:55">[01:50:55]</a>.
    *   While generally safe, individuals with blood pressure issues should be cautious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:11">[01:54:11]</a>.
    *   Proper technique is crucial; improper use can lead to damage (e.g., arm turning purple) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:32">[01:54:32]</a>. Research settings use specific cuffs to monitor pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:56">[01:54:56]</a>.

## Expert's Personal Routine
Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, a busy professor and researcher, maintains a four-day-a-week resistance training routine with an upper/lower split, lasting 45 minutes to an hour per session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:22">[01:56:22]</a>. He trains hard, with sets within 1-2 repetitions of failure, and occasionally to all-out failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:42">[01:56:42]</a>. He also targets 12,000 steps a day for overall [[exercise_and_heart_health | health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:03">[01:57:03]</a>. His protein intake is around 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight or slightly more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:59">[01:57:59]</a>.

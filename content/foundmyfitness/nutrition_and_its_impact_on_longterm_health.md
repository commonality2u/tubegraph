Dr. Bruce Ames, a prominent scientist with over 550 published papers, is the Director of the Nutrition and Metabolism Center at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He is known for the Ames Mutagenicity test, which identifies chemical compounds that can damage DNA and cause mutations, potentially leading to cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This test successfully identified mutagenic chemicals in permanent hair dyes in the 1970s, leading to their removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, and also in flame retardants used in children's pajamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

More recently, Dr. Ames has focused on [[nutrition_and_dietary_impacts_on_health | nutrition]] and developed a concept called the "triage theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This theory posits that even if individuals do not exhibit acute symptoms of nutrient deficiencies (like scurvy or beriberi), there can still be long-term consequences from insufficient intake of vitamins and minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## The Epiphany: Folic Acid Deficiency

Dr. Ames' entry into the field of [[nutrition_and_dietary_impacts_on_health | nutrition]] was sparked by an experiment conducted by Jim MacGregor, a cytogeneticist who found that control mice in his lab had widespread chromosome breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. MacGregor discovered that the vitamin mix used for the mice mistakenly lacked folic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. A dose-response experiment revealed that less folic acid correlated with more chromosome breaks, indicating that folic acid deficiency causes DNA damage similar to radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Further research in Ames' lab showed that folic acid, which delivers one-carbon groups, is essential for nucleic acid synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A deficiency prevents the proper methylation of thymine in DNA, leading to uracil being mistakenly incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Repair enzymes attempt to remove uracil, creating transient nicks in the DNA. If two nearby lesions occur on opposite strands, the chromosome breaks apart, mirroring the effect of radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

This revelation was significant because a large portion of the population, particularly the poor who often consume less nutritious diets, are at levels of folic acid deficiency that can cause chromosome breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This led Dr. Ames to ponder if other vitamin and mineral deficiencies could similarly impact DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## The Triage Theory Explained

Dr. Ames realized that across evolution, animals frequently experienced shortages of the 30 different vitamins and minerals necessary for metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. When a micronutrient is scarce, nature prioritizes its allocation to proteins essential for immediate survival and reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This means that functions critical for short-term survival (e.g., blood clotting) receive the nutrient first, even if it means sacrificing long-term health processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

> "Basically what nature's doing is trading long-term health for short-term health. And it wants short-term survival." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>

This "rationing" implies that enzymes or proteins involved in long-term health maintenance, such as DNA repair enzymes (which accumulate damage over a lifespan, increasing cancer risk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, might be under-resourced during mild deficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. These long-term consequences are often associated with the [[dietary_impacts_on_aging_and_cancer | diseases of aging]], like brain decay, heart disease, and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

### Examples of Triage in Action

Joyce McCann in Dr. Ames' lab conducted extensive reviews on vitamin K and selenium, confirming the triage system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

*   **Vitamin K:**
    *   Vitamin K is a cofactor for enzymes that add an acid group to glutamic acid, enabling proteins to bind calcium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
    *   There are two main forms: Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone), found in plants, goes directly to the liver to activate blood-clotting proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
    *   Only after blood clotting proteins are satisfied is remaining vitamin K used for other functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
    *   Vitamin K2 (menaquinone), found in fermented foods like natto, circulates more widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
    *   Proteins like matrix Gla-protein (MGP) require vitamin K to prevent arterial calcification, a slow process leading to heart disease over years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
    *   Osteocalcin, another vitamin K-dependent protein, is crucial for strong bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
    *   Patients taking warfarin (Coumadin), an anti-clotting drug that interferes with vitamin K, experience higher rates of arterial calcification and bone fractures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. This supports the idea that the body prioritizes clotting over long-term bone and arterial health when vitamin K is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   **Selenium:** Selenium is necessary for approximately 25 enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Both too much and too little selenium can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Current Nutritional Guidelines vs. Long-Term Health

Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), and Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) are primarily based on preventing acute deficiency diseases like scurvy or beriberi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

> "Well, all of nutrition is basically short-term. That is, you're looking for some disease, scurvy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>

This narrow focus means current guidelines do not adequately address the amounts needed to prevent the insidious, long-term damage that contributes to aging and chronic diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. For example, the RDA for vitamin D is set at 600 IU, which is often insufficient to raise blood levels to a truly sufficient range (30 nanograms/mL or above), particularly for those with existing deficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.

### "Longevity Vitamins"

Dr. Ames proposes the concept of "longevity vitamins" â€“ compounds that, while not essential for immediate survival, play a crucial role in maintaining long-term health and extending lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

*   **Carotenoids:** These orange pigments found in plants, like lutein and zeaxanthin, are not currently classified as vitamins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. However, they are concentrated in the macula of the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>, where they absorb toxic blue light and dissipate energy from singlet oxygen, protecting the eye from oxidative damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Deficiency leads to age-related macular degeneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. Dr. Ames argues these should be considered longevity vitamins due to their role in long-term health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

## Future of Nutrition and Personalized Medicine

The future of preventive medicine will heavily involve [[nutrition_and_dietary_impacts_on_health | nutrition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. This includes:
*   Identifying and measuring "vulnerable proteins" that serve as biomarkers for specific micronutrient deficiencies related to long-term health, not just acute diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.
*   Advancements in analytical methods, such as machines that can measure 1500 proteins from a single finger prick of blood, will enable personalized assessment of nutrient status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.
*   Considering individual genetics: Polymorphisms can affect nutrient requirements, meaning some individuals may need more of certain vitamins or minerals than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. For example, a significant portion of the population has a genetic polymorphism that prevents them from converting beta-carotene into active vitamin A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

## [[Impact of lifestyle habits on health and longevity | Impact of Diet and Lifestyle Habits]]

Consuming a "bad diet" (one with a poor ratio of calories to essential micronutrients, or "empty calories") accelerates aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

Key dietary components highlighted for their contribution to [[impact_of_diet_on_longevity_and_healthspan | longevity]] include:
*   **Greens:** Provide vitamin K, magnesium (at the center of the chlorophyll molecule), and folic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   **Nuts:** Offer beneficial nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.
*   **Fish:** Essential for omega-3 fatty acids, which are critical for [[impact_of_diet_on_aging_and_brain_function | brain function]] and can impact conditions like ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
*   **Potassium:** Found in vegetables, bananas, and fruits, potassium is vital as the body regulates the sodium-potassium ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

### Vitamin D and its Significance
Vitamin D is more akin to a steroid hormone than a typical vitamin, controlling over a thousand genes, many in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Deficiency is widespread, affecting 70% of the U.S. population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. Darker skin pigmentation can hinder vitamin D production from sun exposure, making supplementation especially important for individuals with darker skin living in northern latitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. While the current RDA is 600 IU, it often isn't enough to achieve sufficient blood levels (above 30 ng/mL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. Rickets, a severe vitamin D deficiency disease, has reappeared in children in areas like Children's Hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.

## The Role of Supplements

While striving for a good diet is crucial, supplements can serve as "good insurance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>. Dr. Ames personally takes vitamin D, fish oil, and calcium-magnesium pills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of balancing minerals like calcium and magnesium, suggesting calcium-magnesium pills instead of just calcium, as an imbalance can lead to shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

Current medical training often lacks sufficient [[nutrition_and_dietary_impacts_on_health | nutrition]] education for physicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. Furthermore, clinical trials for nutrients are difficult to fund because vitamins and minerals cannot be patented, unlike pharmaceutical drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. This contributes to a lack of research into their long-term [[impact_of_diet_on_longevity_and_healthspan | health impacts]] compared to acute deficiency prevention.

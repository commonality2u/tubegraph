Dr. Dale Bredesen, internationally recognized for his understanding of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's, advocates for a multi-pronged protocol to prevent and treat mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. He holds faculty positions at UCLA and the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, where he was also the founding president and CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Dr. Bredesen is also the author of the *New York Times* best-selling book, "The End of Alzheimer's Disease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Understanding Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's is the most common cause of cognitive decline leading to dementia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. By definition, it involves amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau tangles in the brain, though these are markers and not necessarily the sole cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Historically, amyloid has been "vilified" as a neurotoxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, Dr. Bredesen emphasizes that amyloid is also a protectant, produced by the brain in response to specific insults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Research by Professor Rudy Tanzi and Professor Robert Moir showed amyloid to be an antimicrobial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, while Professor Ashley Bush demonstrated its ability to bind divalent metals like copper, zinc, and iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Dr. Bredesen's own research showed it's a response to reduced trophic support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The presence of amyloid does indicate an increased risk for a degenerative process, but many individuals produce it without experiencing "downsizing" or cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Subtypes of Alzheimer's Disease
Dr. Bredesen and his team identified 36 factors contributing to Alzheimer's, which can be categorized into several types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>:

*   **Type 1 (Inflammatory or "Hot" Alzheimer's)**: Caused by pathogens or inflammation, such as those from a leaky gut, *P. gingivalis* (gum disease bacteria), *Borrelia* (Lyme disease), or fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Amyloid is seen as a protective "napalm" that kills invaders but reduces the brain's functional network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Type 2 (Atrophic or "Cold" Alzheimer's)**: Characterized by decreased trophic support, meaning insufficient levels of factors critical for synaptogenesis (formation of synapses), such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), estradiol, testosterone, pregnenolone, progesterone, thyroid hormones, and [[vitamin_d_and_dementia_risk_reduction | vitamin D]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This leads to a downsizing of the neural network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Type 1.5 (Glycotoxic)**: A hybrid of Type 1 and Type 2, resulting from [[effect_of_inflammation_and_insulin_resistance_on_alzheimers | insulin resistance]] due to chronic high insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This leads to a change in insulin signaling (reducing its trophic support) and glycation of proteins (measured by hemoglobin A1C), causing both atrophy and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Type 3 (Toxic or "Vile" Alzheimer's)**: A response to exposure to various toxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. These can include:
    *   **Metalotoxins**: Such as mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.
    *   **Organic toxins**: Like DDE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.
    *   **Biotoxins**: Produced by molds (e.g., *Stachybotrys*, *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*) such as trycothesinson, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin, and gliotoxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
    *   Patients with Type 3 often present younger (late 40s to mid-50s), are frequently women, and often ApoE4 negative (unless homozygous for E4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. They typically experience non-amnestic presentations like executive dysfunction, problems with calculation, visual perception, or word finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. They may also exhibit low serum zinc, high copper-zinc ratios, and low triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Type 4 (Vascular Component)** and **Type 5 (Traumatic Component)**: While distinct, these are related to the other primary types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

All these subtypes involve amyloid plaques and tau tangles, although their presentation can differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### ApoE4 Genetic Risk Factor
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **ApoE3**: Most common variant, lifetime risk of Alzheimer's is about 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **One copy of ApoE4**: Present in about a quarter of the population (75 million Americans), lifetime risk is about 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Two copies of ApoE4 (homozygous)**: Present in about 7 million Americans, lifetime risk is over 50%, potentially as high as 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

ApoE4 was the primordial variant for most of hominid evolution and provides an advantage by triggering inflammation, which is beneficial in environments with parasites or infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. However, in modern non-inflammatory environments, this chronic inflammation becomes counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. This concept, known as antagonistic pleiotropy, means a gene that helps in youth can increase disease risk later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

## The ReCODE Protocol: Reversal of Cognitive Decline
The ReCODE (Reversal of Cognitive Decline) protocol is a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach that personalizes treatment based on the specific contributing factors identified for each individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. It has shown unprecedented results, with over 3,000 people on the protocol and published improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. The core principle is to understand *why* complex chronic illnesses like Alzheimer's occur, rather than just treating symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

Dr. Bredesen advocates for everyone 45 or older to get a "cognoscopy," a series of tests to identify risk factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

### [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | Key Biomarkers for Cognitive Decline Risk Assessment]]
A "cognoscopy" includes assessing various biomarkers to identify specific imbalances and risk factors for Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>:
*   **ApoE4 Genetic Status**: To determine genetic risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **hsCRP**: A marker of inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **Homocysteine**: A marker of methylation. High levels are associated with increased neurodegeneration and faster decline in cerebral grey matter and hippocampal volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. Optimal homocysteine is less than 7, not 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Fasting Insulin**: Optimally less than 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.
*   **Hemoglobin A1C**: Reflects average blood glucose over the past two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   **Fasting Glucose** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **[[vitamin_d_and_dementia_risk_reduction | Vitamin D]]**: Optimal levels are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
*   **Hormone Levels**: Pregnenolone, progesterone, estradiol, testosterone, free T3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
*   **Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)**: While not easily measured clinically, their levels are inferred from lifestyle factors like exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **Toxic Exposures**: Testing for metalotoxins (e.g., mercury), organic toxins, and biotoxins (e.g., mycotoxins from mold exposure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. Urine tests can measure mycotoxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. Home testing for mold using the EPA Relative Mold Index (ERMI) is also recommended (e.g., via mycometrics.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Gut Health**: Assessing gut health with tests like Genova's GI effects or Cyrex arrays (e.g., Array 2 for LPS, Array 3 for gluten/gliadin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.
*   **History of Head Trauma** and **Vascular Compromise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_aging | Dietary Interventions]]: The Ketoflex 12/3 Diet
The dietary approach, called Ketoflex 12/3, is a cornerstone of the ReCODE protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

### Ketosis
The "Keto" part aims for mild ketosis (1.5 to 4 millimolar beta-hydroxybutyrate), which improves cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. This is achieved through a very low carbohydrate, high-fat diet with "good fats" like avocados, nuts, and seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. MCT oil or coconut oil can help initiate ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

*   **ApoE4-positive individuals**: Should aim for 14-16 hours of fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. They are better fat absorbers, and while MCT oil can kickstart ketosis, they should transition to more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats after 1-2 months to balance cardiovascular and cognitive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. LDL particle number should be kept below 1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.
*   **ApoE4-negative individuals**: Can aim for 12-14 hours of fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
*   Individuals with very low BMI should liberalize the diet once a week with some carbohydrates like sweet potatoes to prevent weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.

### Flexitarianism
The "Flex" means the diet is plant-rich and can include some animal products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. Meat is seen as a condiment and should be pastured chicken or grass-fed beef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. Fish should be wild-caught and low in mercury (avoiding large, long-lived fish like tuna, shark, swordfish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. "SMASH" fish (salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines, herring) are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.

### Fasting (12/3)
The "12/3" refers to fasting periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>:
*   **Minimum 12-hour fast** overnight: This allows for autophagy, induces ketosis, and facilitates the glymphatic system's "cleaning out" of the brain during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
*   **Three hours before bed**: Finish dinner at least three hours before going to sleep to avoid high insulin levels impacting cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

### Other Dietary Considerations
*   **Organic Foods**: To minimize exposure to toxins in food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.
*   **Avoid Refined Carbohydrates and Processed Foods**: Excessive simple carbs are considered "dementogens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.

## [[impact_of_lifestyle_habits_on_aging_and_longevity | Lifestyle Interventions]] and [[preventative_measures_for_dementia | Prevention]]
Beyond diet, a comprehensive approach includes other [[lifestyle_and_environmental_factors_affecting_aging | lifestyle and environmental factors affecting aging]]:
*   **Exercise**: Essential for brain health and increasing BDNF levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Critical for the glymphatic system to clear out brain waste and improve cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
*   **Stress Reduction**: Stress levels are surprisingly important factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Detoxification (e.g., Saunas)**: Saunas are part of the protocol, helping to detoxify the body of metals like cadmium and mercury, as well as hydrophobic toxins like BPA, reducing the overall toxic burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. They also offer cardiovascular benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.
*   **Addressing Pathogens**: If infections like Lyme disease (Borrelia, Bartonella, Babesia, Ehrlichia) or chronic herpes viruses (CMV, EBV, HSV, HHV) are present, they need to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

## Importance of a Multi-Therapeutic Approach
Treating Alzheimer's effectively requires a comprehensive, personalized program that addresses the multiple underlying factors, rather than relying on a single drug (mono-therapeutics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. The failure of clinical trials targeting amyloid plaques alone highlights that amyloid is a mediator, not the sole cause, and its presence is a response to upstream issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. Removing amyloid without addressing its underlying causes can be counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>.

This integrated approach emphasizes [[diet_and_lifestyle_impact_on_longevity | diet and lifestyle impact on longevity]] and [[effects_of_diet_on_aging | effects of diet on aging]], aiming to optimize metabolism, reduce inflammation, balance trophic support, and eliminate toxic exposures to restore synaptic balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>. Dr. Bredesen believes that Alzheimer's should become a rare disease with the current generation, provided everyone gets checked and follows an optimal, personalized program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.

For more information, Dr. Bredesen refers to his book "The End of Alzheimer's" and his website, drbredesen.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

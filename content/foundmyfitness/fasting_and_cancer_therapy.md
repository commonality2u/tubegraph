Valter Longo, a Professor of Gerontology and Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California and Director of the Longevity Institute, has significantly contributed to the field of aging by studying the effects of [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] and other diets on human aging, lifespan, and biomarkers of health span, including metabolic [[Fasting and caloric restriction mimetics | fasting therapies]] for diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. His work focuses on periodic [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]] and, more specifically, [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | fasting-mimicking diets]] (FMDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD)
The concept of the [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | fasting-mimicking diet]] emerged as a safe and accessible alternative to continuous [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Valter Longo, a former student of [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] pioneer Roy Walford, observed the stressed and thin state of participants in the Biosphere 2 human [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] study and sought a powerful yet widely adoptable intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Unlike [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]], which involves a permanent 20-30% reduction in calories, [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]] and periodic [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]] (or FMDs) are more extreme, designed to orchestrate broad gene changes to enhance protection and activate [[Fasting and stem cell regeneration | stem cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The FMD typically lasts four days to one week and is characterized by being low in protein, low in sugar, and high in beneficial fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

A key distinction of periodic [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]] and FMDs is the critical role of refeeding. While cells may enter a protective mode during [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]], the subsequent refeeding period is where significant regeneration and rebuilding of systems occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This cyclical process of reduction and rebuilding is absent in continuous [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Fasting and Cancer Therapy
Valter Longo's research shows that [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]] and FMDs have significant implications for cancer therapy due to their ability to induce "differential stress resistance" and "differential stress sensitization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>:

*   **Differential Stress Resistance (DSR):** Normal cells, when starved, enter a protected, shielded mode, making them more resistant to various stressors, including chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Cancer cells, however, cannot respond similarly due to dysregulated oncogenes, thus remaining unprotected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   **Differential Stress Sensitization (DSS):** Cancer cells, accustomed to a high-nourishment environment (abundant proteins, amino acids, sugars, growth factors), become "miserable" and desperate when nutrients are restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. This starvation makes them highly vulnerable and "primed to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

In animal studies, combining [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]] or FMDs with chemotherapy resulted in cancer-free survival, a outcome rarely seen with either intervention alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. This suggests that the combined approach leverages the strengths of both traditional and integrative medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

### Metabolic Impact on Cancer Cells
Cancer cells often rely on glucose for energy (the Warburg effect) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. [[Intermittent fasting | Fasting]] lowers glucose levels, forcing cancer cells to shift to oxidative phosphorylation and utilize mitochondria for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. This "fasting-dependent anti-Warburg effect" is disadvantageous for cancer cells, leading to increased free radical production and cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. This metabolic shift also makes cancer cells more "immunogenic," meaning they are easier for the immune system to recognize and eliminate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Fasting takes away the cancer cell's ability to "trick" the immune system by presenting proteins that identify it as "one of yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

### Clinical Trials and Adoption
Early clinical trials involving cancer patients who underwent [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]] before or after chemotherapy showed that normal cells were more resistant to chemotherapy's stresses, while cancer cells were more sensitized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. This approach aims to reduce side effects and enhance treatment efficacy. The development of a pre-packaged FMD (ProLon FMD by L-Nutra) was crucial for improving patient compliance and doctor acceptance, treating it more like a "medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

Valter Longo believes that within 10 years, such interventions will become standard practice in doctor's offices, reflecting a shift from a purely drug-centered mentality to one that empowers the body's natural healing and regenerative capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. Cancer's rising incidence underscores the need for these metabolic interventions to integrate with, or even complement, standard care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

## Conclusion
The potential of [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]] and FMDs extends beyond cancer to various chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. Longo advises patients with effective existing treatments to wait for more extensive clinical data. However, for those struggling with current therapies, discussing the integration of FMD with their clinicians is a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. This approach prioritizes understanding the underlying mechanisms and quickly translating findings into clinical trials to address immediate patient needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.

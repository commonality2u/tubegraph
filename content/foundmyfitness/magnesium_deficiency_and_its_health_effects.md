[[importance_of_nutrients_like_magnesium_and_vitamin_D_in_health | Micronutrient inadequacies]] are a widespread problem in the United States and other developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Among these, [[magnesium_deficiency_and_its_impact_on_health | magnesium]] deficiency is particularly common.

## Prevalence of Deficiency

Approximately 50% of the U.S. population does not meet the adequate intake of [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for an adult is, on average, about 400 milligrams per day, though it varies slightly for males and females <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

Physically active adults, especially those who exercise frequently or use saunas, can excrete [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] through sweat and may require 10% to 20% more than the RDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

## [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | Magnesium's]] Vital Role in the Body

[[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | Magnesium]] is an essential mineral that acts as a cofactor for over 300 different enzymes in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. These enzymes are crucial for:
*   **DNA Repair** [[health_benefits_of_magnesium_and_sources | Enzymes]] important for repairing DNA damage require [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. DNA damage occurs daily and accumulates over time, potentially leading to dysfunctional cells and oncogenic mutations that can cause cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   **DNA Synthesis** The replication of DNA when new cells (blood cells, immune cells, skin cells) are made requires enzymes called DNA polymerases, which need [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] to function properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **Genomic Stability** [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | Magnesium]] is vital for maintaining the integrity and genomic stability of our DNA, which is very important for preventing cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

## [[health_benefits_of_magnesium_and_sources | Health Benefits of Magnesium]]

Observational studies, while acknowledging potential confounding factors, have indicated significant benefits associated with adequate [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] levels:
*   People with the highest [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] levels have a 40% lower all-cause mortality and a 50% lower cancer mortality compared to those with the lowest levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.
*   A specific study on pancreatic cancer found that for every 100-milligram decrease in [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] intake, there was a 24% increase in pancreatic cancer incidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

## Sources and Supplementation

The widespread [[magnesium_deficiency_and_its_impact_on_health | deficiency]] is largely due to dietary habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | Magnesium]] is found at the center of the chlorophyll molecule, which gives plants their green color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.

### Dietary Sources
Foods rich in [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] include:
*   Dark leafy greens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>
*   Legumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>
*   Almonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>
*   Oats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>

Many people do not consume multiple servings of dark leafy greens daily, contributing to inadequate intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

### Supplementation
Supplemental [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] can be an option to help achieve adequate levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. However, high doses of [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] can cause adverse effects like gastrointestinal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

Forms of [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] supplements with good bioavailability include:
*   [[health_benefits_of_magnesium_and_sources | Magnesium glycinate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>
*   [[health_benefits_of_magnesium_and_sources | Magnesium malate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>
*   [[health_benefits_of_magnesium_and_sources | Magnesium citrate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>

Magnesium dioxide is noted as not being very bioavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>. Electrolyte drinks can also help replace lost [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] after physical activity or sauna use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

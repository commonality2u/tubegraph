## Nutritional Benefits by Ingredient

### Magnesium (from leafy greens)

Green leafy vegetables like kale, rainbow chard, and spinach are rich in magnesium. Magnesium is central to the chlorophyll molecule, which gives plants their green color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **Prevalence of Deficiency**: Approximately 45% of the U.S. population does not meet the adequate daily intake for magnesium, which is set at 350-400 milligrams a day. Athletes may require 10-15% more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Cellular Energy and ATP**: Over 300 different enzymes in the body require magnesium to function, including those involved in producing and using ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's energetic currency. ATP must bind to a magnesium ion to be biologically active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_micronutrients_for_mitochondrial_health | importance of micronutrients for mitochondrial health]].
*   **DNA Repair and Cancer Prevention**: Magnesium is crucial for DNA repair enzymes, which mend damage caused by normal metabolism and immune function, preventing mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. It is also required for DNA polymerases and DNA ligase, ensuring accurate cell replication and preventing mutations that could lead to cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Smoothie Contribution**: The smoothie provides around 588 milligrams of magnesium, exceeding the recommended daily allowance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Kale

Kale is a primary ingredient in the smoothie due to its high concentration of beneficial compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

*   **Lutein and Zeaxanthin**: These two carotenoids are highly concentrated in the retina of the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    *   They filter out singlet oxygen produced by blue light, which is damaging to the rods and cones in the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   They possess antioxidant activity, protecting against [[micronutrients_and_agerelated_diseases | age-related macular degeneration]] and slightly enhancing visual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   **Smoothie Contribution**: The smoothie provides around 390 milligrams of lutein and zeaxanthin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Sulfur-Containing Compounds (Sulforaphanes and Isothiocyanates)**: Kale is a cruciferous vegetable, rich in sulforaphanes. When raw kale is chopped or chewed, enzymes called myrosinases convert sulforaphanes into isothiocyanates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. These enzymes are heat-sensitive, so raw kale is preferred for maximum isothiocyanate benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   **Epigenetic Regulation**: Isothiocyanates can epigenetically turn genes on and off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
        *   They turn off "bad" genes, specifically phase one biotransformation enzymes, which convert pro-carcinogens into full-blown carcinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
        *   They turn on "good" genes, such as Phase two detoxification enzymes, which are antioxidant and anti-inflammatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
    *   **Cancer Cell Inhibition**: Isothiocyanates are known to kill cancer cells by preventing DNA damage and activating tumor suppressor genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Rainbow Chard

Four leaves of rainbow chard are added to the smoothie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

*   **Vitamin K1**: Chard is a good source of Vitamin K1. Around 65% of the U.S. population does not meet the adequate intake for vitamin K1 (90-120 micrograms/day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
    *   **Functions**: Both Vitamin K1 and K2 act as cofactors to activate proteins involved in three key functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>:
        1.  **Coagulation**: Blood clotting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
        2.  **Calcium Metabolism**: Removing calcium from the bloodstream to prevent calcification of blood vessels and arteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Philosophy of Plant-Based Nutrition

Dr. Patrick emphasizes that while the smoothie provides known vitamins and minerals, nutrition is a vast field with many "unknowns." Science is still mapping the various compounds in plants and their interactions with human metabolism, which may take many more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. She advocates for diversifying fruit and vegetable intake to benefit from both known nutrients and undiscovered compounds that could positively impact human health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Blender

Dr. Patrick uses a Blendtec blender for her smoothie, having previously used a Vitamix for four years. She notes that any blender with a powerful motor will suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

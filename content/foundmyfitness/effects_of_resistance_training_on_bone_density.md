[[resistance_training_advantages_for_health_and_fitness | Resistance training]] is considered indispensable for overall health, with a specific and profound impact on bone density, a benefit that goes beyond what can be achieved through cardiovascular exercise alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Aerobic exercise, such as running, offers minimal effects on bone development compared to [[resistance_training_advantages_for_health_and_fitness | resistance training]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Preventing Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis, characterized by porous bones, involves the degradation of bones over time, especially in sedentary individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Women account for 80% of osteoporosis cases, primarily because they typically start with less bone mass and experience increased bone resorption post-menopause due to the osteoprotective effects of estrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

[[resistance_training_advantages_for_health_and_fitness | Resistance training]] strengthens bones by engaging the musculoskeletal system, where muscles pull on bones during movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This process strengthens bones as muscles are strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Consistent and regular [[resistance_training_advantages_for_health_and_fitness | resistance training]] can profoundly stave off the potential for osteoporosis and even build bone density, particularly when started at a younger age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Optimizing Bone Development

To maximize bone development, [[resistance_training_advantages_for_health_and_fitness | weight-bearing exercise]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Activities like cycling or elliptical training are generally not weight-bearing enough to have substantial effects on bone development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Running offers some ground reaction forces that benefit the femur and lower-body musculature, but [[resistance_training_advantages_for_health_and_fitness | resistance training]] is more comprehensive, impacting areas prone to osteoporosis like the spine and wrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

While most research on bone density has used moderate to heavier loads, it is surmised that lighter-load training, when performed with high levels of effort, could achieve similar effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Recommended Exercises

Incorporating **multi-joint movements** is beneficial for maximizing bone development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. These exercises engage more than one joint and utilize multiple muscle groups, imposing greater loading on the bones. Examples include:
*   Squats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   Rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
*   Presses (e.g., shoulder press, chest press) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>
*   Push-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>
*   Deadlifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>
*   Chin-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>

These can be performed with free weights like dumbbells, such as a goblet squat, shoulder press, or chest press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Starting Age for Bone Health

It is never too late to begin [[resistance_training_advantages_for_health_and_fitness | resistance training]] for bone health, with significant benefits seen even in individuals in their 60s, 70s, and 80s who have never lifted weights before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Meta-analyses have shown profound improvements in muscle strength and [[strength_and_hypertrophy_training | muscle hypertrophy]] within 8 to 12-week programs for novices aged 70 and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

However, starting younger is always better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. For women, in particular, it is very important to start early (teens and twenties) to build up a "bone bank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This concept is likened to a retirement account: the earlier one starts, the greater the reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Building this reserve when young can help stave off osteoporosis later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Once bone density is lost, it becomes very difficult to regain, although progression can be prevented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

Children can also safely start [[resistance_training_advantages_for_health_and_fitness | resistance training]] as young as six, seven, or eight years old, provided it is done in a fully supervised environment and made enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. There is no evidence to support the myth that [[resistance_training_advantages_for_health_and_fitness | resistance training]] stunts growth in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Injuries in major sports like football and basketball are much higher than in [[resistance_training_advantages_for_health_and_fitness | resistance training]] when performed safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

Limiting food intake is a highly reproducible intervention shown to modulate the [[strategies_to_enhance_healthspan_and_address_agerelated_diseases | aging process]] across multiple organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While there are various modalities, [[caloric_restriction_intermittent_fasting_and_their_biological_effects | caloric restriction]] is distinct from [[timerestricted_eating_and_its_benefits | time-restricted feeding]] or [[Fasting and caloric restriction mimetics | fasting]].

## Defining Caloric Restriction

[[Caloric restriction]] is defined as a chronic reduction of calories below the normal level, maintained consistently over time, to a point that it prevents an individual from maintaining a normal weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Effects on Healthspan and Longevity

Research in the [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | caloric restriction]] field indicates that this chronic reduction in calories can have significant effects on diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. In monkey studies, [[caloric restriction]] has been shown to:
*   Completely eliminate diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   Reduce cardiovascular disease and cancer by 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Despite these "unbelievable effects" on health, the impact on overall lifespan is less consistent. Monkeys on [[caloric restriction]] may live slightly longer or not at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Monkey Studies Overview
Two prominent monkey studies on [[caloric restriction]] were conducted by the University of Wisconsin and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>:
*   **Wisconsin Study:** Showed an increase in mean lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This study used a control diet that was considered a "reasonably good model for the western diet," which was worse than the NIA's control diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **NIA Study:** Did not show an extension of mean lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The NIA's control diet was described as "somewhat of an ideal monkey diet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Both studies showed a "huge effect" on "disease-dependent lifespan" (mortality caused by major [[agerelated diseases | age-related diseases]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. However, when considering overall survival across all causes of mortality, the survival curves were very close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This suggests [[caloric restriction]] has a more pronounced effect on [[strategies_to_enhance_healthspan and address agerelated diseases | healthspan]] (the duration of healthy life) than on overall lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Genetic Pathways and Metabolism
[[Caloric restriction]] is almost certainly associated with lower levels of nutrient-signaling pathways such as [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | mTOR]] and [[Fasting and caloric restriction mimetics | IGF-1]], due to the 30% reduction in proteins and sugars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

A minimal switch to a [[effects_of_ketogenic_diet_on_longevity_and_healthspan | ketogenic mode]] may occur with [[caloric restriction]], but it largely depends on the individual's specific restriction methods and dietary composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### Challenges and Human Studies
Long-term [[caloric restriction]] in humans can lead to problems, including chronically low blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. For instance, participants in Biosphere 2, and others studied by Fontana, experienced continuous drops in blood pressure, with some reaching levels like 85/55 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

Studies by Dr. Fontana's lab on humans undergoing [[caloric restriction]] showed that individuals naturally tended to eat more protein for satiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Those consuming a higher animal protein diet, even with [[caloric restriction]], maintained higher IGF-1 levels compared to animal studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Only when protein intake was also restricted did IGF-1 levels decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19]">[00:19:19]</a>. This highlights the interconnectedness of insulin, IGF-1, and protein/sugar intake in regulating growth pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. In yeast, sugar intake appears to dominate the aging rate, with protein being second most important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

### Comparison to the [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | Fasting-Mimicking Diet]] (FMD)
Unlike chronic [[caloric restriction]], the [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | fasting-mimicking diet]] (FMD) appears to act as a "reset" mechanism for the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. The FMD, tested in healthy subjects for three cycles of five days once a month, demonstrated specific effects:
*   No significant change in markers for individuals already having healthy or low levels (e.g., blood pressure, glucose) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
*   Normalization of elevated markers such as cholesterol, triglycerides, IGF-1, fasting glucose, and blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
*   Reduction of systemic inflammation (CRP) to the normal range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.

The FMD differs because it incorporates a refeeding phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>, which is crucial for the rebuilding and regeneration process, including [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | stem cell]] activation and proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>. This "shrinking and re-expanding effect" on organs allows for preferential clearance of damaged cells and subsequent replenishment with healthy ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. [[Caloric restriction]], being chronic, does not have this periodic rebuilding phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

Dr. Bill Harris, a professor at the Sanford School of Medicine at the University of South Dakota and founder of OmegaQuant and the Fatty Acid Research Institute, has dedicated over 40 years to researching fatty acids, particularly [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3 fatty acids]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. His work, which includes over 300 publications on fatty acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, has significantly advanced the understanding of these crucial nutrients, especially their effects on cardiovascular health, all-cause mortality, and brain health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Early Discoveries of Omega-3s

Dr. Harris's interest in [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3 fatty acids]] was sparked in the late 1970s while working as a post-doctoral researcher with Dr. Bill Connor in Portland, Oregon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Connor was investigating how dietary fat affected cholesterol levels, a significant area of research at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. They knew that vegetable oils lowered cholesterol and animal fats raised it, but the underlying reasons were unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Connor proposed studying fish oil, an animal-derived fat that is liquid at room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Dr. Harris was tasked with designing a metabolic ward feeding study comparing saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and fish oil diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Participants consumed very high doses of salmon oil (around 25 grams of [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3]] per day), with all dietary fat coming from salmon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Initially, the study aimed to see the effect on cholesterol, but they unexpectedly discovered that fish oil significantly lowered triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. While the reduction was statistically significant in healthy volunteers (from 100 to 75 mg/dL), it was clinically minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. However, when the study was repeated with hyperlipidemic individuals, particularly those with very high triglycerides (Type 5 hyperlipidemia), they observed robust reductions, up to 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This groundbreaking finding was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, helping to put [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3s]] on the map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## The Omega-3 Index: A Key Risk Factor

The concept of the Omega-3 Index was developed by Dr. Harris and Dr. Clemens von Schacky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. This idea emerged after reviewing a 2002 study by Dr. Christine Albert from Harvard, which found that higher blood [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3 levels]] significantly reduced the likelihood of sudden cardiac death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. Recognizing [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3]] as a modifiable risk factor, similar to cholesterol, they proposed a standardized test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

The Omega-3 Index measures the percentage of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in red blood cell (RBC) membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>. RBCs are preferred over plasma because they provide a more stable, long-term marker of [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3 status]], akin to how HbA1c reflects long-term glucose levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. The initial paper proposing the Omega-3 Index was published in *Preventive Medicine* in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

Typical Omega-3 Index values vary globally:
*   **Average Americans**: Roughly 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.
*   **Japanese**: On average 9-10% due to higher fish intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.
*   **Vegans and US Military Personnel**: Around 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

The recommended target Omega-3 Index is over 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>. Achieving this level is associated with reduced risk of various diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

## Omega-3 Index and All-Cause Mortality

A recent collaborative study involving 17 different cohorts and approximately 40,000-45,000 individuals worldwide investigated the relationship between the Omega-3 Index and all-cause mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. The study found that individuals with the highest [[Role of omega3 fatty acids in longevity | Omega-3 Index]] (over 7.8%) were about 15% less likely to die over a 10-year period (specifically between ages 65 and 75) compared to those with the lowest levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. This correlation was dose-dependent, with higher Omega-3 levels leading to lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.

The protective effect extended beyond cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality to "everything else" mortality, indicating a systemic protective role of [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3s]] across multiple body systems and diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. Another study from the Framingham cohort suggested that being in the lowest Omega-3 Index group (under 4%) compared to the highest (over 7%) could mean approximately five years earlier mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.

Furthermore, the Omega-3 Index was found to have a similar predictive value for mortality as traditional risk factors like cholesterol, blood pressure, and smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. For example, having a low Omega-3 Index was associated with a similar risk of death as being a smoker, though this does not mean [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3s]] negate the risks of smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>. Smoking itself is known to lower the Omega-3 Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>.

## Omega-3 Index and Cardiovascular Health Trials

### The REDUCE-IT Trial
The "REDUCE-IT" trial was a highly successful [[Benefits of omega3 fatty acids for human health | omega-3]] study, using 4 grams per day of EPA (as Vascepa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. It demonstrated a 25% reduction in cardiovascular events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. Crucially, the study reported that the achieved [[Benefits of omega3 fatty acids for human health | omega-3 level]] (plasma EPA concentration) was the strongest predictor of benefit, even more so than cholesterol or triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.

### The STRENGTH Trial
In contrast, the "STRENGTH" trial, a larger study that used 4 grams per day of EPA plus DHA (as Epanova, a free fatty acid formulation), showed no effect on cardiovascular events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>. The study was even stopped early for futility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a>. Possible explanations for this unexpected outcome include potential chronic inflammatory responses from the free fatty acid formulation or lower event rates in the study population compared to REDUCE-IT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:27">[01:30:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a>.

### The VITAL Study
The "VITAL" study, which included 25,000 people, also yielded mixed results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:22">[01:33:22]</a>. While the primary composite outcome was not met, there were significant reductions in specific individual elements, such as heart attack risk, especially in those with lower fish intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>. This trial used a lower dose (840 mg of EPA plus DHA, similar to one Lovaza capsule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:11">[01:34:11]</a>.

### Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Protection
While [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3s]] are known to lower triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>, Dr. Harris believes the primary mechanisms for their cardioprotective effects are likely [[Omega3 fatty acids and inflammation | anti-inflammatory]] and anti-platelet (blood-thinning) actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.

Recent research also explores the effect of [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3s]] on Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW), a measure of the variation in red blood cell sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. A wider RDW is a strong predictor of adverse health outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>. High [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3 levels]] correlate with a healthier, narrower RDW, suggesting that [[Benefits of omega3 fatty acids for human health | omega-3s]] may improve red blood cell flexibility and oxygen delivery to tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>.

## Safety and Common Misconceptions

### Bleeding Risk
The concern about [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3s]] causing excessive bleeding has historical roots in anecdotal stories from Eskimo populations and early studies showing reduced platelet aggregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>. However, extensive research, including studies on high-dose supplementation before open-heart surgery, indicates that [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3s]] do not cause clinically significant bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. In fact, some studies showed less post-operative bleeding and less need for transfusion with [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3]] supplementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. The FDA's package insert for omega-3 prescription drugs like Vascepa states they do not cause clinically significant bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>. Furthermore, [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3s]] may play a preventative role in pulmonary embolisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:45">[01:45:45]</a>.

### Prostate Cancer
A 2013 paper suggested a correlation between higher blood [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3 levels]] and an increased incidence of prostate cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:01">[01:23:01]</a>. However, Dr. Harris criticizes the paper's interpretation, noting that it drew a causal link from an association, and the observed differences in [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3 levels]] were tiny and not seen in supplementation studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>. This finding has been largely refuted by other studies that showed [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3s]] to be protective against prostate cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>.

### Omega-3 to Omega-6 Ratio
The idea that the [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3]] to [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-6]] ratio is critical is imprecise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>. The terms "omega-3" and "omega-6" encompass various fatty acids with different functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>. A "bad" ratio can be improved by increasing [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3]] intake, which is the beneficial action, not necessarily by lowering [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-6]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. Studies show that higher linoleic acid (an [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-6]]) levels in the blood are associated with a lower risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>, challenging the notion that all [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-6s]] are detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>.

## Broader Health Implications and Future Research

### [[Omega3 fatty acids and inflammation | Omega-3s and Inflammation]]
[[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | Omega-3s]] are known to lower inflammatory biomarkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. They do this by producing specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), which actively suppress and resolve inflammation, rather than just preventing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. This is crucial for managing chronic low-grade inflammation associated with conditions like obesity and various diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

### COVID-19 Mortality
A pilot study, peer-reviewed and published in January 2021, looked at the Omega-3 Index in 100 hospitalized COVID-19 patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. It found that those with the highest Omega-3 levels (top quartile) were about half as likely to die compared to others, suggesting a strong trend towards protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>. Global data also suggests a correlation between higher average fish intake and lower COVID-19 death rates across countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. *In silico* experiments even suggest DHA could hold the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a closed, non-infectious conformation, potentially suppressing infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.

### [[Benefits of omega3 for brain health | Brain Health]] and [[Omega3 fatty acids and their effects on mental health | Mental Health]]
Current research is investigating the [[Benefits of omega3 for brain health | Omega-3 Index's]] ability to predict the risk of Alzheimer's and dementia, with preliminary findings suggesting a protective effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:20">[01:36:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:29">[01:36:29]</a>. This research is vital for prevention, especially for individuals with a genetic predisposition, as intervening early is more effective than trying to reverse damage once conditions are established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39">[01:37:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>.

### [[Omega3 and pregnancy outcomes | Pregnancy Outcomes]]
A Cochrane report (a meta-analysis of 70 trials) highlighted that [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3]] supplementation in pregnant women reduces the risk of premature birth, particularly early premature birth (before 34 weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:05">[01:39:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:18">[01:39:18]</a>. While one large trial, the ORIP study, showed negative results, this was potentially due to poor compliance with supplementation, leading to minimal change in the [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | Omega-3 Index]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>. OmegaQuant has developed an RBC DHA test for pregnant women, recommending levels over 5% to reduce the risk of preterm birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:31">[01:40:31]</a>.

## The [[Importance of Omega3 fatty acids for longevity | Importance of Omega-3 Fatty Acids for Longevity]]
The average daily intake of EPA and DHA in America is around 100-150 milligrams, with the median intake being effectively zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. In contrast, Japan's average intake is about 900 milligrams per day, contributing to their longer average lifespan (four to five years longer than the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

While obtaining [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3s]] from food sources like salmon and sardines is ideal, supplementation is a practical alternative for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>. The low background intake of [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3s]] in many populations and their relatively simple metabolism make them easier to study than other nutrients, contributing to their extensive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

Future research aims to:
*   Measure [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3 levels]] at baseline in clinical trials and only include individuals with low levels, or analyze results based on achieved [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3 levels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:30">[01:35:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:57">[01:35:57]</a>.
*   Explore higher doses of [[Omega3 Fatty Acids and Their Health Benefits | omega-3s]] in trials to determine optimal intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:56">[01:44:56]</a>.
*   Investigate sustainable sources of EPA and DHA, such as algal oils and genetically engineered land plants (e.g., camelina or soybean oil), to meet global demand without depleting fish stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:06">[02:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>.

The widespread [[Benefits of omega3 fatty acids for human health | benefits of omega-3 fatty acids]] across the entire lifespan, from development to aging, highlight their [[Importance of Omega3 fatty acids for longevity | importance for longevity]] and overall health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.

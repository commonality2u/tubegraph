[[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Neurodegenerative diseases]], including [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]], are among the "big three" diseases that account for 75% of deaths in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] is the only [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | neurodegenerative disease]] currently on the top 10 list of causes of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.

## Increasing Incidence of [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's Disease]]

Over the last 50 years, the prevalence of [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] has increased by approximately 2.5% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. In contrast, human longevity has increased by about 0.6% per year over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>. This significant spread suggests that [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] is not merely a natural consequence of aging, but rather something in the environment is triggering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.

## The "Brain Diabetes" Hypothesis

Peter Attia views [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] as "brain diabetes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. This perspective is supported by the strong association between [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]], Type 2 diabetes, and hyperinsulinemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. He hypothesizes that the disease stems from a neuronal energy problem, where there is difficulty in getting glucose through pyruvate dehydrogenase and into the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>. The tau plaques and other synaptic issues often observed in [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] are considered byproducts of this underlying energy deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.

### Dietary and Therapeutic Approaches

*   **Insulin Sensitivity**: Being as [[the_significance_of_maintaining_lean_muscle_mass_and_insulin_sensitivity | insulin-sensitive]] as possible is believed to reduce the risk of [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]], regardless of [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE genotype]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. Increasing the [[the_significance_of_maintaining_lean_muscle_mass_and_insulin_sensitivity | insulin sensitivity]] of the brain is thought to delay or eliminate [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | AD]] risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.
*   **Ketones**: Administration of exogenous Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) can bypass the metabolic deficit by going straight through alpha-hydroxybutyrate into the Krebs cycle, transiently overcoming neurological deficits and reversing signs and symptoms in animal models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.
*   **Dietary Interventions**: Richard Isaacson, a neurologist at Cornell, uses very-low-glycemic-index diets coupled with MCT oil to induce ketosis, showing promising results in patients with early cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

## The Role of [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE Genotype]]

The [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE genotype]] is considered a susceptibility factor for [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.

*   **Risk Factors**:
    *   An [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE 3/4 genotype]] is associated with approximately a 2x increased risk of [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] compared to 3/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.
    *   An [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE 4/4 genotype]] carries a 10x to 20x increased risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.
    *   Between 65% and 80% of all [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] cases have at least one [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE4 allele]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
    *   An [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE 3/3 genotype]] does not protect against [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | AD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.
*   **Protective Factors**:
    *   The [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE 2/2 genotype]] offers protection against [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | AD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
    *   The [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE 2/4 genotype]] has a similar hazard ratio for cardiac disease as the 3/3, suggesting the 2 and 4 alleles can cancel each other out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.

### Phenotype vs. Genotype

Peter Attia believes that the amount of [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE]] expressed (phenotype) matters more than the specific [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decl_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE genotype]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. A study found that serum [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE]] levels were more predictive of [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] than the genotype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Higher plasma [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE]] expression is linked to a higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>. Clinically approved assays to measure serum [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE]] levels are desired to help patients reduce their risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.

### [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | ApoE4]] Biology and Dysfunction

[[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE]] is produced in the liver and astrocytes and plays a crucial role in transporting cholesterol from astrocytes to neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. It also aids in repairing damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. However, [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE4]] is associated with:

*   **Reduced Expression**: Less [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE]] expression in [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE4]] carriers can lead to problems with the LDL receptor's ability to deliver cholesterol to neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   **Dominant Negative Effect**: [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE4]] contains a 2-amino acid substitution that alters its protein structure, causing it to cleave and accumulate as aggregates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. These aggregates activate microglia, perpetuating an [[effect_of_inflammation_and_insulin_resistance_on_alzheimers | inflammatory process]] in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>.

## [[dietary_and_lifestyle_interventions_for_alzheimers_prevention | Lifestyle Factors and Alzheimer's Risk]]

Lifestyle plays a significant role in [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] risk, particularly for those with an [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE4 allele]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.

*   **Inflammation**: Anything that causes damage and [[effect_of_inflammation_and_insulin_resistance_on_alzheimers | inflammation]] increases [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | AD]] risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
    *   Refined carbohydrates and added sugars contribute to [[effect_of_inflammation_and_insulin_resistance_on_alzheimers | inflammation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.
    *   Inflammatory molecules can cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to further damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.
*   **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**: Individuals with [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE4]] are at a much higher risk of developing [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] following TBI, sometimes up to 10-20 times higher depending on the number of alleles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.
*   **Alcohol Consumption**: Drinking, especially with an [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | ApoE4]] allele, can worsen outcomes due to impaired repair mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

## Neuronal Energy Metabolism

Neurons primarily utilize lactate from astrocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>. Astrocytes are glycolytic, using glucose to generate lactate, which is then shuttled into neurons because it's thermodynamically favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>. This process is similar to how beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) shunts directly into the TCA cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>. Exercise has been shown to increase the brain's uptake of lactate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. TBI can disrupt astrocytes' ability to produce lactate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>. Exogenous lactate or BHB are being explored for treating TBI, as they provide an alternative energy source and allow glucose sparing, which is crucial for making glutathione to counteract oxidative stress from trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.

## Connections to Other Health Concerns

*   **Sleep**: Peter Attia mentions that lifestyle factors like sleep are among the influences on longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. While not explicitly detailed, [[connections_between_sleep_and_alzheimers_disease | sleep]] and its relation to [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] is a broader area of interest.
*   **Inflammation**: [[effect_of_inflammation_and_insulin_resistance_on_alzheimers | Inflammation]] is recognized as a driver of the aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. The gut is considered a major source of [[effect_of_inflammation_and_insulin_resistance_on_alzheimers | inflammation]] in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

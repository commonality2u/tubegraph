A child born in 2007 has a 50% chance of living to 104 years old, a projection based on the progression of lifespan over the last century, which has seen an increase of approximately two years per decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This potential for extended longevity highlights the growing interest in understanding and regulating the aging process to promote a longer, healthier life.

## Lifestyle Interventions and Aging

Research in the aging field identifies four broad categories of interventions for extending healthspan and lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>:
1.  **Exercise:** Considered the most effective intervention for increasing healthspan and lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
2.  **Nutrition:** An active area of research focusing on the roles of macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) in longevity and healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
3.  **Mimetic Molecules:** Identification of compounds that mimic the effects of exercise or calorie restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
4.  **Rejuvenation:** Approaches aimed at repairing and fixing damage that has already occurred due to aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

Many scientists consider exercise and nutrition the cornerstone of current efforts to combat aging, until better pharmaceutical interventions are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Dietary Approaches to Regulate Aging

Recent decades have seen significant research into how macronutrient intake can alter the aging process and extend average lifespan in animal models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This research has led to a re-evaluation of public dietary policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Key Aging Pathways and Carbohydrates

One of the major pathways controlling aging identified in model organisms like *C. elegans*, fruit flies (*Drosophila*), and mice is the insulin signaling pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This pathway, first highlighted by Cynthia Kenyon in 1990, suggests that increased carbohydrate consumption, which activates insulin signaling, could accelerate aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Recent human studies support this, showing a direct correlation between all-cause mortality and the amount of carbohydrates consumed, with the lowest mortality observed in those who ate the least carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. While the study did not differentiate between refined carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates like vegetables, total carbohydrate intake was a strong predictor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Ketogenic Diets and Fasting Mimicry

[[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | Dietary interventions in longevity]] like fasting are known to regulate the aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Fasting decreases insulin signaling and leads to the induction of ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Ketogenic diets mimic many aspects of fasting, particularly the metabolic state of ketosis, which is generated by the liver during fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The beneficial effects of fasting and fasting-mimicking diets on healthspan and lifespan are increasingly supported by evidence in both animal models and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

These effects may stem from a combination of mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>:
*   Decreased carbohydrate intake, leading to reduced insulin signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   Restricted [[impact_of_protein_on_aging_cancer_and_longevity | protein]] intake, leading to decreased mTOR signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   Induction of [[ketosis_and_its_effects_on_cognitive_function | ketosis]], with beta-hydroxybutyrate itself potentially having beneficial effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Research on Ketogenic Diets in Mice

A study published by Dr. Eric Verdin's lab demonstrated that a cyclic ketogenic diet given to male mice starting at one year old (equivalent to a 30-year-old human) significantly increased their healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

*   **Healthspan and Lifespan:** The mice showed an increased medium lifespan by about 10% (decreased early mortality), but no increase in maximum lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Function:** Most remarkably, older mice on the ketogenic diet displayed better memory than younger mice and did not experience the typical age-associated loss of memory function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

Another independent study by Jon Ramsey and colleagues at UC Davis, using a continuous ketogenic diet with controlled caloric intake to prevent obesity, observed similar or even better effects on healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. These parallel findings reinforce the intriguing biological effects of ketogenic diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### Mechanisms Behind the Benefits

#### Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB)

The major circulating ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), is generated from fat by the liver during fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. It serves as an energy source for the brain, which cannot use fat directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. BHB's ability to spare glucose ensures that the body does not extensively break down muscle protein for glucose production during prolonged fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

Beyond energy metabolism, BHB also acts as a signaling molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. In 2010, Dr. Verdin's lab published research in *Science* showing that BHB is an endogenous inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. HDACs are [[epigenetics_and_their_influence_on_aging | epigenetic]] regulators linked to aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

*   **Gene Expression Regulation:** As an HDAC inhibitor, BHB can regulate gene expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Key targets include enzymes like FOXO3, a transcription factor linked to aging that controls the response to oxidative stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. This suggests BHB protects against oxidative stress both as a nutrient and as a regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
*   **Concentration:** While BHB is a poor HDAC inhibitor at typical concentrations, its levels can reach millimolar range in plasma and brain during fasting, making it effective at inhibiting HDACs and increasing histone acetylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Exogenous BHB administration has been shown to induce hyperacetylation of histones in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

#### PPAR-alpha Activation

In the mouse studies, a significant difference between ketogenic diets and non-ketogenic high-fat diets was the activation of PPAR-alpha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. PPAR-alpha is a key enzyme in the fasting response and its activation on a ketogenic diet may contribute to the observed beneficial effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.

#### NAD+ Levels and Sirtuins

NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a critical intermediary metabolite and a "currency" for energy circulation within cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Its levels decrease during aging, which impairs the function of NAD-dependent enzymes like sirtuins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>. Sirtuins are global regulators, and their decreased function contributes to less efficient metabolism and overall aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.

The decrease in NAD+ may be due to increased consumption by enzymes like PARP (which repairs DNA damage) or impaired NAD+ recycling via the salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. Supplementation with NAD+ precursors like nicotinamide riboside has shown protective effects, for example, against noise-induced hearing loss in mice, an effect dependent on sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) in the mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Efficient mitochondrial function is critical for healthy aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

#### Autophagy and Acetyl-CoA

[[intermittent_fasting_and_its_effects_on_aging_pathways | Intermittent fasting and its effects on aging pathways]], including ketogenic diets, activate autophagy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>, a cellular recycling process crucial for maintaining cellular health. This response to nutrient availability is also linked to NAD+ and acetyl-CoA levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. Acetyl-CoA acts as both a nutrient and a signaling molecule, influencing [[epigenetics_and_their_influence_on_aging | epigenetic]] regulators like acetyltransferases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.

### Dietary Considerations for Ketogenic Diets

*   **Protein Intake:** Individuals on ketogenic diets may tend to increase their protein intake for satiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. However, excessive [[impact_of_protein_on_aging_cancer_and_longevity | protein]] intake can increase IGF-1 signaling, which is linked to an increased risk of [[dietary_impacts_on_aging_and_cancer | cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. This needs careful consideration for long-term ketogenic diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
*   **Liver Function:** The liver plays a central role in transforming fat into ketone bodies during ketosis. Long-term ketogenic diets in animal models have not shown adverse effects on liver function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

### Practicality and Challenges

Maintaining a long-term ketogenic diet is challenging due to its restrictiveness (no significant carbohydrates, limited alcohol, bread, pasta, or many fruits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>. It's often considered an "antisocial diet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

[[intermittent_fasting_and_its_effects_on_aging_pathways | Intermittent fasting]] and time-restricted eating are considered more accessible approaches for promoting similar beneficial metabolic pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. Allowing a daily fasting period, for example, 14 hours overnight, can suppress insulin secretion, activate autophagy, and promote other beneficial pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.

## The Need for Human Biomarkers

While animal studies show promising results regarding the [[impact_of_diet_on_longevity_and_healthspan | impact of diet on longevity and healthspan]], human responses to [[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | dietary interventions in longevity]] vary greatly due to genetic and biological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. For instance, some strains of mice benefit from calorie restriction, while others experience shortened lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

A crucial need in the field of aging is the identification of reliable biomarkers that can predict whether an intervention will be beneficial or harmful for an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. Emerging biomarkers include:
*   **Facial Recognition:** Using artificial intelligence to analyze facial features to estimate biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   **Blood Metabolites:** Analyzing panels of standard blood markers to generate curves and assess biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   **Epigenetic Clock:** Changes in DNA methylation patterns that correlate with chronological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

These tools aim to provide a stronger prediction of an individual's biological age, allowing for personalized interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

## The Buck Institute for Research on Aging

The Buck Institute for Research on Aging, founded in 1998, is the first research institute exclusively devoted to aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>. With over 220 employees, it conducts research across various model organisms, from yeast and nematodes to fruit flies, mice, and humans, aiming to translate fundamental discoveries in aging biology into human applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. The institute is at the forefront of the growing interest from pharmaceutical and venture capital sectors in the aging space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major global health concern. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death for both men and women worldwide and in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The understanding of ASCVD is clearer than that of other chronic diseases like cancer or neurodegenerative diseases, providing more tools for prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Understanding Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)

ASCVD is a disease characterized by plaque formation inside coronary arteries, which leads to ischemiaâ€”a reduction in blood flow to vital parts of the heart muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This can manifest chronically or acutely. An acute event in a compromised region of the heart muscle can result in sudden death, commonly known as a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Sobering Statistics
Historically, over 50% of people's first symptom of coronary artery disease was sudden death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While this number is now slightly less than 50%, it remains a "very sobering statistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. In medical school, the most common presenting feature for first-time [[cardiovascular_disease_and_prevention | cardiovascular disease]] was sudden death, not typical symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Atherosclerosis typically begins at birth and takes decades to progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. Autopsies of very young individuals, like a 26-year-old homicide victim, have shown advanced atherosclerosis even if not clinically relevant at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

## The Role of Lipoproteins in ASCVD
Cholesterol is an essential component for life, crucial for cell fluidity and as a precursor for hormones like testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Since cholesterol is not water-soluble, it must be wrapped in water-soluble lipoproteins to be transported in the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### ApoB: The Key Metric
The main protein on the surface of these lipoproteins is called an apolipoprotein, specifically ApoB 100 (abbreviated ApoB) for low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

In the 1950s, high total cholesterol was loosely correlated with cardiovascular outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Decades later, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) was found to be a stronger predictor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. However, the best way to predict risk is by measuring the concentration of all ApoB particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

> "That number ApoB measured in milligrams per deciliter is the concentration of the entire burden of particles that are capable of undergoing something that I'm sure we'll talk about which is the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>

ApoB is superior to LDL particle number (LDL-P) and LDL-C because:
*   It encompasses the total atherogenic burden, including VLDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   It is standardized across different labs, unlike LDL-P measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   Elevated ApoB always indicates an issue with clearance, often related to LDL receptor function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
*   Genetic conditions can lead to normal LDL but very high VLDL, which ApoB captures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

LDL-C is often estimated using the Friedewald equation (Total Cholesterol - HDL Cholesterol - Triglyceride/5), which can be inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Directly measuring LDL-C is better, but still inferior to ApoB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

### Optimal ApoB Levels
Reference ranges for ApoB are population-based (e.g., below 80 mg/dL is often considered "wonderful" based on the 20th percentile) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. However, once the causal link between ApoB and ASCVD is understood, these percentiles are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

The analogy of cigarettes and lung cancer is used: one would not wait for a threshold of risk to advise quitting smoking, but rather eliminate the causal factor immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. Similarly, ApoB should be managed aggressively to minimize the "area under the curve" of lifetime exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

Children are born with ApoB levels typically below 20 mg/dL, with no negative consequences, demonstrating that very low levels are physiologically sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. Experts suggest that an ApoB level below 20-30 mg/dL would make atherosclerosis impossible to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. A lifetime ceiling of 60 mg/dL would still be considered very low risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

## Modifiable Risk Factors for ASCVD
The four major causal drivers of ASCVD are:
1.  ApoB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>
2.  Insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>
3.  Hypertension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>
4.  Smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>

### [[impact_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_cholesterol_and_heart_health | Diet]] and Lipids
Dietary factors significantly impact ApoB levels.
*   **Triglyceride Burden**: Higher triglycerides lead to higher ApoB. Lowering triglycerides, which is a proxy for insulin sensitivity, helps keep ApoB in check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
*   **Carbohydrate Restriction**: This is the "most effective tool" for triglyceride reduction, specifically limiting refined and starchy carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.
*   **Saturated Fat Consumption**: Saturated fat can increase ApoB by directly impacting cholesterol synthesis and inhibiting the creation of LDL receptors in the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. Individual responses vary greatly; some can tolerate high saturated fat diets with normal lipids, while others experience significant increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. Swapping saturated fat for monounsaturated fat can correct high ApoB in about half of hyper-responders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.

It is generally advised to use nutrition to solve nutritional problems (energy balance, protein intake) and let lipids "fall where they may," as pharmacological tools for lipid management are highly effective and often preferable to overly restrictive diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

## Pharmacological Interventions for Lipid Management
Drugs targeting LDL (and thus ApoB) primarily work by increasing LDL receptors on the liver, which then clear more LDL from circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>.

*   **Statins**: These inhibit the first committed step of cholesterol synthesis, causing the liver to upregulate LDL receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.
    *   **Side Effects**: Approximately 7% of people experience muscle aches, which are reversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>. A small subset (about 4%) may develop [[role_of_ldl_and_statins_in_managing_heart_disease_risk | type 2 diabetes]] due to increased [[impact_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_cholesterol_and_heart_health | insulin resistance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>. Liver enzyme elevation can also occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>.
    *   **Mitochondrial Function**: While statins affect the HMG-CoA pathway, which is important for ubiquinol (CoQ10) synthesis needed for mitochondrial function, their impact on [[cardiovascular_adaptations_to_exercise_and_aging | mitochondrial function]] (as measured by Zone 2 lactate testing) appears "very small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. CoQ10 supplementation has not consistently shown to reduce muscle soreness from statins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Neurodegenerative Disease**: No study has primarily looked at statin use and the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>. However, secondary outcomes in 15-25 studies show a neutral to beneficial effect of statins on dementia/AD incidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>. There was no difference between hydrophobic and hydrophilic statins in these outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>. A potential concern is very low desmosterol levels (a proxy for brain cholesterol synthesis), which can increase AD and dementia risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. If desmosterol falls below 0.8 mg/dL, statin use may be aborted, especially in individuals with ApoE4 gene or family history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>.
*   **Ezetimibe (Zetia)**: This drug increases LDL receptors by impairing cholesterol reabsorption in the gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a>. It is less potent than statins but can be highly effective in patients with defective ATP binding cassettes in their gut, indicated by high phytosterol levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>.
*   **PCSK9 Inhibitors**: These are highly effective and safe, working by targeting a protein that degrades LDL receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:57">[02:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>. They have "insanely safe" zero side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:40">[02:02:40]</a>. However, they are expensive ($500/month in the US) and often not covered by insurance unless specific criteria are met (e.g., familial hypercholesterolemia, prior cardiac event, statin intolerance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:30">[02:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   **Bempedoic Acid**: A prodrug that inhibits cholesterol synthesis specifically in the liver, leading to increased LDL receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:19">[01:28:19]</a>. It lowers ApoB without the systemic side effects of statins, such as type 2 diabetes risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:43">[01:28:43]</a>. Like PCSK9 inhibitors, it is also expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:52">[01:28:52]</a>.

### Other Interventions
*   **Berberine**: A systematic review (2022) suggests berberine is beneficial for lowering LDL cholesterol and potentially particle number, alone or in combination with statins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>. It may also lower statin-induced myopathy and reduce the effective dose of statins needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>. Berberine is a complex I inhibitor, similar to metformin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:54">[01:34:54]</a>.

## Risk Factors and Prevention

### Hypertension
*   **Target Blood Pressure**: A blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg or better is recommended, based on the SPRINT trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:43">[02:59:43]</a>.
*   **Measurement**: Use an automated cuff, sit for 5 minutes without stimulation, and take two more readings, averaging the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:31">[03:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:03">[03:07:03]</a>. The arm should be positioned with the cuff at the level of the right atrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:12">[03:07:12]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Impact**: Losing weight and [[exercise_and_cardiovascular_health | exercising]] (especially cardio) can significantly improve blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:24">[03:10:24]</a>.
*   **Other Factors**: Nitrates from green vegetables and cocoa flavanols (which boost nitric oxide) can help lower blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:40">[03:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:58">[03:13:58]</a>. High homocysteine levels can impair nitric oxide synthesis, contributing to high blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>.

### Metabolic Health and [[impact_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_cholesterol_and_heart_health | Glucose Regulation]]
Glucose regulation is a complex physiological process involving the endocrine system, liver, and muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:13">[01:37:15]</a>.
*   **Glucose Disposal**: Muscles are the primary "sink" for glucose disposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:12">[01:41:15]</a>. This happens via insulin-dependent and, in fit individuals, insulin-independent mechanisms (muscle contraction itself promotes glucose uptake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:14">[01:42:14]</a>.
*   **Toxicity of Glucose**: Chronic elevation of glucose levels is damaging to small blood vessels (microvasculature) in the eyes, kidneys, heart, and brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:48">[01:43:48]</a>. Chronic elevation of insulin is damaging to large blood vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:59">[01:44:59]</a>. Postprandial hyperinsulinemia (high insulin after meals) is an early indicator of metabolic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.
*   **Optimal Glucose Levels**: The lower the average blood glucose, the better. A hemoglobin A1c of 5% (average blood glucose of ~100 mg/dL) is associated with better all-cause mortality outcomes than 5.5% (average blood glucose of ~115 mg/dL), even though both are considered normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:05">[01:49:05]</a>. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can track average glucose and variability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:58">[01:50:58]</a>.

## [[Exercise and cardiovascular health | Exercise]] and its Impact on Cardiovascular Health
Exercise is crucial for [[impact_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_cholesterol_and_heart_health | insulin sensitivity]] and glucose disposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.

*   **Zone 2 Training**: This type of [[exercise_intensity_and_frequency_for_optimal_heart_health | exercise]] expands the capacity of [[cardiovascular_adaptations_to_exercise_and_aging | mitochondria]] to efficiently utilize fatty acids for energy (metabolic flexibility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>.
    *   **Measurement**: Zone 2 can be approximated by Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) where one can speak but it's uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>. Heart rate can be estimated by 180 minus age, with adjustments for fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>. The "gold standard" is lactate testing, keeping lactate below 2 millimoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.
    *   **Training Ratio**: High-level endurance athletes, like cross-country skiers and cyclists (who have the highest [[cardiorespiratory_fitness_and_longevity | VO2 Max]] and metabolic flexibility), train with an 80/20 rule: 80% Zone 2, 20% high intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:50">[01:55:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:21">[01:56:21]</a>.
*   **[[cardiorespiratory_fitness_and_longevity | VO2 Max]]**: This is one of the best metrics for health and longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:35">[02:06:35]</a>. Individuals in the top 2.5 percentile for [[cardiorespiratory_fitness_and_longevity | VO2 Max]] have a 400 times lower all-cause mortality risk compared to those in the bottom 25 percentile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:11">[02:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:22">[02:07:22]</a>.
    *   **Measurement**: VO2 Max is measured during a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) on a bike or treadmill, measuring oxygen consumed and CO2 produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Respiratory Quotient (RQ) or RER (ratio of VCO2 to VO2) indicates fat vs. carbohydrate oxidation during exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:03">[02:03:03]</a>. Peak fat oxidation is another important metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.

## Sleep and Stress Management
*   **Sleep**: Disruptions to sleep (both acute and chronic) impair insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:26">[01:46:26]</a>. Consistent sleep schedules are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:39">[03:43:39]</a>. Avoiding stimulating activities (like emails or social media) before bed and maintaining a cool sleeping environment are beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:22">[03:44:22]</a>.
*   **Stress**: Chronic stress and hypercortisolemia can contribute to insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:53">[02:11:53]</a>. Mental health practices like therapy and journaling help increase distress tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>.

## Hormones and Cardiovascular Health

### Women: Menopause and Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)
Menopause involves a rapid decline in estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:15">[02:38:15]</a>. This leads to short-term symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, brain fog, and sleep disturbances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>. Longer-term, it results in sexual changes (vaginal atrophy, reduced libido) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:50">[02:40:50]</a> and, critically, significant bone loss, increasing the risk of fractures later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:26">[02:41:26]</a>.

HRT is largely justified by these symptoms and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:21">[02:42:21]</a>. The misinterpretation of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study in 2001-2002 led to widespread cessation of HRT, depriving millions of women of beneficial hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:42">[02:42:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:20">[02:43:20]</a>.

*   **WHI Misinterpretation**: The WHI study found a statistically significant but clinically insignificant 0.1% absolute increase in breast cancer risk in women taking conjugated equine estrogen (CE) plus synthetic progestin (MPA), but no difference in breast cancer mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:24">[02:46:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:14">[02:47:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:19">[02:47:19]</a>. The CE-alone group showed a *lower* breast cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:32">[02:46:32]</a>. This suggests MPA, not estrogen, was the problematic component, and MPA is rarely used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:29">[02:48:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>.
*   **Modern HRT**:
    *   **Estrogen**: Bioidentical estrogens (estradiol, estriol) are used. Oral estradiol has a small but non-zero risk of hypercoagulability, so transdermal patches are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:46">[02:52:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:51">[02:52:51]</a>. Vaginal estrogen creams can address local sexual symptoms without systemic effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:03">[02:55:03]</a>.
    *   **Progesterone**: Micronized oral progesterone or progesterone-coated IUDs are used in women with a uterus to prevent endometrial hyperplasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:02">[02:49:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:36">[02:54:36]</a>.
    *   **Testosterone**: Important for libido, orgasmic function, and maintaining muscle mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:05">[03:15:05]</a>. Women's testosterone levels are typically 1/10th of men's and significantly higher than their estrogen levels in absolute quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:03">[02:39:03]</a>.
*   **Initiation Timing**: Starting HRT at the time of menopause is believed to reduce the risk of heart disease, dementia (especially for ApoE4 women), and preserve bone mineral density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:02">[03:01:02]</a>. Late initiation (e.g., 10 years post-menopause) may be counterproductive for AD risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:14">[02:59:14]</a>.

### Men: Low Testosterone (Low T)
Male testosterone levels decline gradually starting in their 20s or 30s, unlike the sharper decline seen in women at menopause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:39">[03:20:39]</a>. Low T is a combination of low levels and symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:08">[03:21:08]</a>. Symptoms include reduced libido, energy, and mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:19">[03:23:19]</a>. Signs include insulin resistance, difficulty building muscle mass, and impaired exercise recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:28">[03:23:28]</a>.

*   **Treatment**: Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) aims to restore physiological levels, typically using injections twice a week for more stable levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:21">[03:26:21]</a>. Target levels aim for the 95th percentile of free testosterone (e.g., 20 ng/dL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:34">[03:24:34]</a>.
*   **Prostate**: TRT does *not* increase the risk of prostate cancer; in fact, lower testosterone is associated with a higher risk of high-grade prostate cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>. However, it can potentially increase prostate size (benign prostatic hypertrophy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:21">[03:27:21]</a>.
*   **Other Side Effects**: Hair loss and acne can occur in susceptible individuals, especially at super-physiologic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:32">[03:27:32]</a>.
*   **Cardiovascular Risk**: A slight short-term increase in cardiovascular event risk, possibly due to increased blood pressure, has been observed in some high-risk men upon TRT initiation, but this effect vanished over longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:50">[03:28:50]</a>. It's prudent to ensure other health factors (like blood pressure) are in order before initiating TRT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:34">[03:29:34]</a>.

## Screening and Monitoring
*   **CT Angiogram (CTA)**: Can show plaque accumulation in arteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:22">[03:00:22]</a>. It is useful when findings might change management, such as a positive finding in a young person or a negative finding in an older person, indicating a need for more or less aggressive treatment respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:58">[03:06:58]</a>.
*   **Blood Pressure**: Daily at-home monitoring using an automated cuff is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:44">[03:06:44]</a>.

### Cancer Screening
[[cancer_screening_and_prevention | Aggressive cancer screening]] is crucial because, unlike CVD, the underlying causes of cancer are less understood, and modifiable risk factors (like obesity and smoking) account for less than half of cancer cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:48">[02:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:40">[02:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:01">[02:14:01]</a>.

*   **Early Detection**: Treating cancer at an early stage leads to significantly better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:25">[02:14:25]</a>. For example, Stage III colon cancer has a 65% 5-year survival rate with chemotherapy, but Stage IV (with visible metastasis) has a 0% 5-year survival rate with the same treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:42">[02:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:53">[02:15:53]</a>.
*   **Screening Costs**: Screening is far cheaper than treating late-stage cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:43">[02:16:43]</a>.
*   **Mammography**: While mammography has low radiation exposure and is effective, it has limitations, especially in younger women with dense glandular tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:48">[02:21:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:39">[03:13:39]</a>. Combining mammography with ultrasound or MRI improves detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:27">[02:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:35">[03:15:35]</a>.
*   **Colonoscopy**: A highly effective test (100% sensitivity for polyps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:44">[02:22:44]</a>. Current recommendations suggest starting at age 45, with follow-ups every 3 years depending on findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:16">[02:24:16]</a>.
*   **Liquid Biopsies (e.g., Grail test)**: These tests analyze cell-free DNA in the blood for cancer-indicative mutations or methylation patterns, and can identify the tissue of origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:38">[02:26:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:40">[02:27:40]</a>. While their sensitivity for early-stage breast cancer might seem low (e.g., 20% for Stage 1/2 overall), they are more sensitive (75-80%) for aggressive breast cancers (ER/PR negative), suggesting they catch the "cancers that matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:41">[02:29:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:51">[02:30:51]</a>. They are very good for blood cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:47">[02:36:47]</a>.

## Personal Health and Longevity Strategies

Peter Attia's personal strategies for longevity include:
*   **Sleep**: Consistent bedtime (10 PM to 6 AM), 7.5 hours of actual sleep, using an Eight Sleep mattress cover for cooling, and avoiding activating stimuli (e.g., emails, social media) for hours before bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:32">[03:43:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:22">[03:44:22]</a>. Supplements like glycine, ashwagandha, and magnesium L-threonate are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:37">[03:45:37]</a>.
*   **Nutrition**: Omnivore diet focused on energy balance and high protein intake (40-50 grams four times a day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:04">[03:46:04]</a>. Avoids junk food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:25">[03:46:25]</a>. Stops eating at least 3 hours before bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:25">[03:47:25]</a>.
*   **Alcohol**: Believes there's no biochemical benefit, but acknowledges pro-social benefits. Consumes 0-8 drinks per week, with no more than 2 drinks in a day, and drinks early with dinner to avoid sleep disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:56">[03:47:56]</a>.
*   **[[Exercise and cardiovascular health | Exercise]]**: Daily exercise, including 4 hours of Zone 2 cardio, one high-intensity [[exercise_intensity_and_frequency_for_optimal_heart_health | VO2 Max]] workout, and four strength training sessions per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:26">[03:49:26]</a>. Incorporates additional activities like rucking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:41">[03:49:41]</a>.
*   **Mental Health**: Views mental health as a foundational pillar, supported by proper sleep, nutrition, and exercise to widen the "buffer zone" for distress tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:03">[03:50:03]</a>. Engages in weekly therapy and journaling, along with dialectical behavioral therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>.

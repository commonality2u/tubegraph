Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, often referred to as [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]], is a molecule that has gained significant relevance in the field of aging in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It is considered one of the most important molecules on the planet, so critical that life would cease to exist without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. NAD's importance stems from its fundamental roles in energy metabolism and [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | DNA repair]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## NAD and Energy Metabolism

[[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] plays a critical role in energy metabolism, meaning energy cannot be produced without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. It participates in redox reactions, alternating between its oxidized form (NAD) and reduced form (NADH), which are crucial for metabolizing glucose and fatty acids and forming ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Cells need to maintain massive concentrations of both NAD and NADH for these linked reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Furthermore, [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] acts as a cofactor for many important enzymes, meaning it binds to and activates enzymes to allow them to perform their functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Several NAD-required enzymes are located inside the mitochondria, contributing to energy generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. NAD also serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy production from glucose outside the mitochondria, a process known as glycolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. For instance, red blood cells, which lack mitochondria, rely entirely on glycolysis for their energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## NAD and DNA Repair

[[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] plays a vital role in mitigating [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | DNA damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It is a cofactor for PARP1, one of the most important enzymes involved in [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | repairing DNA damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Activating PARP1 demands a large amount of [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]]; excessive [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | DNA damage]] and subsequent PARP1 activation can reduce [[nicotinamide_adenin_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels to 20-30% of normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

The ability to [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | repair DNA damage]] is important for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Cell lines from human centenarians (100 years or older) show significantly higher PARP1 activity compared to those from 70-year-olds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. PARP1 activity has also been correlated with maximum lifespan in mammals; higher PARP1 activity correlates with a longer lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. For example, humans, the longest-lived mammals tested, exhibited five times the PARP1 activity compared to rats, the shortest-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This suggests that genomic stability, which relies on [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] and PARP1, is crucial for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## NAD and Sirtuin Activation

[[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is required to activate sirtuins, a family of highly conserved enzymes involved in healthspan and longevity across various organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Sirtuins regulate metabolic processes, stress response, and lifespan modulation through epigenetic regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. They use [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] to remove acetyl groups from cellular proteins (deacetylation), controlling gene activation for energy metabolism, autophagy, circadian rhythm, [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | DNA repair]], and cell survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

When cellular energy levels are low, such as during exercise, fasting, or caloric restriction, [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels rise, and the ratio of NAD to NADH increases. This acts as a sensor to switch on sirtuin expression and activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Resveratrol, a natural compound in red grapes, is a potent sirtuin-activating compound, and its health benefits are partly attributed to sirtuin activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## NAD Levels and Aging

Unfortunately, [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD levels decrease with age]] across various tissues, including the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart, all of which have high metabolic demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This decline in [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is associated with many hallmarks of aging, including:
*   Loss of proteostasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   Mitochondrial dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
*   Glucose intolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Insulin insensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   Cellular senescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   Altered epigenetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Increased [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | DNA damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>

The decline in [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels may predispose organisms to various [[effects_of_nad_levels_on_agerelated_diseases | age-related diseases]], such as neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), cardiovascular disease, and muscle atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. It can also increase susceptibility to infections, as the immune system requires significant [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

The exact reasons for the decrease in [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD levels with age]] are still an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. However, it is known that chronic inflammation and immune activation, which consume [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] and increase the need for [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | DNA repair]], tend to rise with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Simultaneously, the body's ability to produce and recycle [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] also diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Factors Influencing NAD Levels

While lifestyle factors significantly influence [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels, particularly through "energy stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>:
*   **Exercise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>
*   **Fasting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>
*   **Caloric Restriction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>

[[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] can be synthesized from dietary sources such as the amino acid tryptophan (found in salmon, spinach, nuts) and the three forms of niacin (Vitamin B3) found in lean meats, legumes, and vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. These forms include nicotinamide (niacinamide), nicotinic acid, and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

However, dietary sources are not the major source of [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The body's demand for [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is so large that it is impossible to consume enough from diet alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The primary source of [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is through a recycling mechanism called the NAD salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. In this pathway, the consumption of [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] by enzymes generates nicotinamide as a byproduct, which is then converted into [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] and subsequently into [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

A crucial point about the salvage pathway is that nicotinamide can inhibit the activity of sirtuins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Additionally, the enzyme that converts nicotinamide into [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] is subject to feedback inhibition by [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This means that at a certain concentration of [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]], nicotinamide will no longer be converted, remaining as nicotinamide, which can inhibit sirtuin activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## NAD Boosters: Nicotinamide Riboside and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide

[[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide riboside]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] are precursors to [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. They can be found in low concentrations in many foods and are also available as supplements, often referred to as [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. In supplement form, they have been shown to be well-tolerated at high doses and effectively raise [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels, ameliorating age-associated diseases in rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Animal Studies

[[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide riboside]] is the most extensively studied [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD booster]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Animal studies at high oral doses have shown it can:
*   Counteract an obesogenic diet by improving insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   Improve endurance and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
*   Reverse mitochondrial damage, increase mitochondrial biogenesis, and reverse muscular atrophy in severe muscle wasting diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>
*   Positively affect the brain by increasing neurogenesis, decreasing cognitive deterioration, reducing amyloid beta production, and increasing synaptic plasticity in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>

[[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide mononucleotide]] has also shown health benefits in animal studies:
*   High-dose injection countered an obesogenic diet and improved metabolic health markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   High-dose injection improved heart function in animals with heart problems and enhanced cognition and memory in animals with neurodegenerative disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   Long-term dietary administration mitigated age-associated physiological decline in mice with accelerated aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Benefits included improved skeletal muscle function, mitochondrial function, increased energy expenditure, increased bone density, and decreased insulin resistance, occurring in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Potential Risks and Cancer

While promising, there's a significant concern regarding [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] and cancer. In a recent study, [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] was shown to accelerate cancer growth in mice with a specific type of pancreatic cancer driven by pro-inflammatory senescent cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. High-dose injections led to significant increases in precancerous and cancerous lesions in the pancreas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

This effect was dependent on senescent cells, which, despite typically preventing cancer in the short term, can disrupt normal tissue function and drive cancer progression over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Senescent cells secrete pro-inflammatory molecules involved in immune activation, evading the immune system, growth signaling, and angiogenesis, which plays a role in cancer metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] appears to increase this tumorigenic quality of senescent cells, likely by enhancing their energy metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. While this study specifically focused on [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]], [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] might show similar results in this specific cancer context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This does not mean these supplements cause or drive all types of cancer, but long-term animal studies are needed for confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

### Translation to Humans: Doses and Bioavailability

Translating preclinical animal data to humans requires careful consideration of dosage and bioavailability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   **Doses**: Many rodent studies used very high oral doses of [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] (e.g., 400 mg/kg body weight), which translates to a human equivalent dose of approximately 2.6 grams per day for a 180-pound person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This is higher than doses clinically tested in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Similarly, most [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] animal studies used very high injected doses (e.g., 500 mg/kg body weight), making translation to humans difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **Bioavailability**: A key question is whether [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] or [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] can reach other tissues intact and directly form [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] without first being metabolized into nicotinamide via the salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] produced solely from the salvage pathway is subject to feedback inhibition, limiting how high [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels can be raised in tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Isotope tracer studies in animals found that at low oral doses (around 50 mg/kg), very low levels of directly formed [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] were found only in the liver, with very low levels in kidneys, muscles, and the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Even at higher oral doses, direct [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] formation from [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] outside the liver was not observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. However, more [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] derived from the salvage pathway was found in the kidney, muscle, and brain at higher doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
*   **Intravenous Administration**: When given intravenously, [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] or [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] did lead to directly produced [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] in the liver, kidney, and muscle in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. However, the only [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] detected in the brain was salvaged from nicotinamide, suggesting that neither compound crosses the blood-brain barrier directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

The data suggests that oral [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] primarily act by being converted to nicotinamide, which is then transported to tissues and converted to [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] via the salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. It's possible that at very high oral doses, the salvaged [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is sufficient to be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. IV administration seems to allow direct [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] formation in multiple tissues, bypassing feedback inhibition and leading to higher concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

### Human Clinical Studies

As of the transcript, there is no published evidence of oral [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] supplementation in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. However, two randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] can increase [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels in white blood cells in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

*   An 8-week study in 120 healthy adults (60-80 years old) showed that 250 mg daily of [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] combined with pterostilbene (a sirtuin activator) increased whole blood [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels by 40% after four weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. A double dose (500 mg) increased levels by 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. The lower dose also led to reduced diastolic blood pressure and lower levels of a liver damage marker, but it's hard to determine if this was due to [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]], pterostilbene, or both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   Another trial with 60 middle-aged and older adults (55-79 years old) found that 500 mg of [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] twice daily (1 gram/day total) for six weeks was well-tolerated and increased [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels in white blood cells by 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. While participants experienced improvements in blood pressure and aortic stiffness, these effects were not statistically significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide riboside]] had no effects on metabolic function, motor function, or exercise capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

The highest dose tested clinically was one gram per day, which is significantly lower than the human equivalent doses where benefits were observed in animal studies (2.6 grams/day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. While short-term studies suggest oral [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] is safe, long-term studies are still needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. It's also worth noting that [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] can break down into nicotinamide over time, especially in high humidity or heat, which may reduce sirtuin activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Keeping these supplements cold helps maintain their stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.

## Direct NAD Supplementation

Directly taking or injecting [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is challenging due to its poor oral bioavailability; ingested [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is primarily digested into precursors like nicotinamide before absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. While intravenous [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] infusion might bypass digestion, no mammalian [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] transporter has been identified, and extracellular [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] has not been shown to be taken up by tissues other than the brain and heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. In mice, injected [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] at high doses did increase levels in some brain regions and the heart, offering protection from cardiac hypertrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. However, there is very little preclinical and zero clinical data on direct IV injection of [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is crucial for survival, obtained from diet, but mainly recycled by the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. Normal aging and daily living lead to [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD levels]] declining, causing metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction and increased [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | DNA damage]], all associated with aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels can be increased through exercise, fasting, or [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] like [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

The data on [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] is promising and exciting, largely derived from animal studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. However, whether these [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] are effective and safe in humans in the long term remains an open question, warranting further research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.

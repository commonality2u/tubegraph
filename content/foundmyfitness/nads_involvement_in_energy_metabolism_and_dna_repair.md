Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide, or NAD, is a molecule that has become increasingly relevant to the field of aging, with its related precursor molecules, [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]], often referred to as NAD boosters [00:00:02]. NAD is considered one of the most important molecules on the planet, as life would cease to exist without it [00:00:24].

## Importance of NAD

[[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD levels decrease with age]] [00:01:14], and this decline across multiple tissue types is associated with numerous hallmarks of aging, including loss of proteostasis, [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_its_role_in_cellular_aging | mitochondrial dysfunction]], glucose intolerance, insulin insensitivity, cellular senescence, and altered epigenetics [00:01:17]. The decline in NAD levels is thought to be a combination of decreased synthesis and recycling, as well as increased consumption and degradation [00:09:03]. Increased [[dna_damage_and_cancer_initiation | DNA damage]] and inflammation, which are common in aging, may further decrease NAD and potentiate aging [00:09:15].

### Synthesis and Recycling
NAD can be synthesized in the body from dietary sources such as the amino acid tryptophan (found in salmon, spinach, and nuts) and the three forms of niacin (vitamin B3), including nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] [00:02:51]. These forms of niacin are found in foods like lean meats, legumes, and vegetables [00:03:01].

However, dietary sources are not the major source of NAD [00:03:17]. The body's demand for NAD is so large that it would be impossible to consume enough from diet alone [00:03:29]. Instead, the primary source of NAD is through a recycling mechanism called the NAD salvage pathway [00:10:07]. This pathway converts nicotinamide (a byproduct of NAD consumption by enzymes) into [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] and subsequently into NAD [00:10:24].

## Role in Energy Metabolism

NAD plays a critical role in energy metabolism; without it, the body cannot produce energy [00:03:38]. It participates in redox reactions, alternating between its oxidized form (NAD+) and its reduced form (NADH) [00:03:45]. These conversions are crucial for the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids and the formation of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's energy currency [00:03:57]. Cells need to maintain massive concentrations of both NAD and NADH to sustain these linked reactions [00:04:05].

NAD also functions as a cofactor for many important enzymes [00:04:20]. A cofactor is required for an enzyme to bind and activate, allowing it to perform its function [00:04:24].
*   **Mitochondrial Energy Production**: Several NAD-required enzymes are found inside the mitochondria, contributing to energy generation [00:04:37]. NAD also acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in glucose-derived energy production outside the mitochondria, a process known as glycolysis [00:04:48]. Some cells, like red blood cells, rely entirely on glycolysis for their energy since they lack mitochondria [00:04:57].
*   **Tissue Function**: Because NAD is essential for energy production in tissues such as the brain, immune cells, and muscle, a decline in [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] with age means these tissues do not function as properly as they did in youth [00:01:48].

## Role in DNA Repair

NAD plays a very important role in mitigating [[dna_damage_and_cancer_initiation | DNA damage]] [00:05:11].
*   **PARP1 Activation**: NAD is a cofactor for PARP1 (Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1), one of the most important enzymes involved in repairing DNA damage [00:05:19]. The activation of PARP1 demands an enormous amount of NAD [00:05:26]. Excessive DNA damage and subsequent PARP1 activation can decrease NAD levels to 20-30% of normal [00:05:30].
*   **Longevity Link**: The ability to repair DNA damage is critical for longevity [00:05:38]. Lymphoblastoid cell lines from centenarians (100 years or older) show significantly higher PARP1 activity compared to cell lines from individuals aged 70 [00:05:43]. PARP1 activity has also been correlated with maximum lifespan in mammals; higher PARP1 activity is associated with a longer lifespan [00:05:55]. For instance, PARP1 activity in humans (the longest-lived mammals tested) was five times higher than in rats (the shortest-lived) [00:06:04]. This suggests that genomic stability, which relies on NAD and PARP1, is very important for longevity [00:06:18].
*   **Reactive Oxygen Species**: NAD decline is associated with an increase in [[dietary_impact_on_dna_damage_and_repair | DNA damaging]] reactive oxygen species [00:01:43].

## NAD and Sirtuins

NAD is also required to activate sirtuins, a highly conserved family of enzymes involved in health span and longevity in multiple organisms [00:06:26]. Sirtuins regulate various metabolic processes, including stress response and lifespan modulation, primarily through epigenetic regulation [00:06:36]. They utilize NAD to remove acetyl groups from cellular proteins (deacetylation), controlling the activation of genes involved in energy metabolism, autophagy, circadian rhythm, DNA repair, and cell survival [00:06:46].

When cellular energy levels are low, such as during exercise, fasting, or caloric restriction, NAD levels rise, and the ratio of NAD to NADH increases [00:07:04]. This serves as a signal to switch on sirtuin expression and activity [00:07:16].

## NAD Decline and Age-Related Issues

NAD depletion with age in tissues like the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart (which have high metabolic demands) leads to degeneration and impaired function [00:07:40]. [[effects_of_nad_decline_with_age | NAD depletion has been associated with hallmarks of aging]] such as decreased autophagy, increased [[dna_damage_and_cancer_initiation | DNA damage]], [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_its_role_in_cellular_aging | increased mitochondrial dysfunction]], and dysregulated metabolism [00:08:03]. This may predispose organisms to age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's), cardiovascular disease, and muscle atrophy [00:08:14]. It may also increase susceptibility to infections, as the immune system requires significant amounts of NAD [00:08:27].

In contrast, [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels increase]] under conditions that promote healthspan, such as exercise, fasting, and caloric restriction [00:08:34]. NAD restoration has been shown to increase lifespan in lower-level organisms (yeast, worms) and rodents [00:08:48].

## NAD Boosters and Research
[[effects_of_nad_boosters_and_their_impact_on_aging | NAD boosters]] like [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside (NR)]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)]] are consumer-available supplements [00:00:16]. In animal studies, these boosters at very high doses have been shown to improve the aging process in multiple tissues and cell types, including the heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and stem cells [00:00:36]. Clinical studies have also shown that [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] can increase NAD levels in white blood cells [00:00:48].

While animal studies have shown promising results in ameliorating age-related diseases by increasing [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging and metabolism | NAD levels]], concerns remain regarding the translation to humans [00:13:51]. These include the very high doses used in animal studies (often higher than clinically tested doses) [00:16:17] and the bioavailability of these compounds, particularly whether they can reach tissues directly without being metabolized through the salvage pathway (which is subject to feedback inhibition) [00:18:01].

One significant concern is the potential impact on cancer. In one study, [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] accelerated cancer growth in mice with a specific type of pancreatic cancer driven by pro-inflammatory senescent cells [00:14:06]. This suggests that NAD might make senescent cells more tumorigenic [00:15:20]. While this does not mean that supplementation will cause cancer or drive progression in other types of cancer, long-term animal studies are needed to confirm safety [00:15:40].

In humans, two randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that oral [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] can increase NAD levels in white blood cells in a dose-dependent manner [00:25:54]. However, long-term safety and efficacy in humans are still open questions [00:29:39].

Overall, while NAD is crucial for survival, energy metabolism, and DNA repair, and its decline is linked to aging, more research is needed to confirm the long-term safety and effectiveness of NAD boosters in humans [00:29:01].

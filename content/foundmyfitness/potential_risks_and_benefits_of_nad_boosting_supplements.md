[[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD)]] is a crucial molecule for life, with its absence leading to the cessation of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In recent years, [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] has become highly relevant to the field of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Its related precursor molecules, [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] (NR) and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] (NMN), are often referred to as [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] and are available as consumer supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

[[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD levels decrease with age]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, and this decline across multiple tissues is associated with many hallmarks of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These hallmarks include loss of proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, glucose intolerance, insulin insensitivity, cellular senescence, and altered epigenetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This is partly because [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | NAD promotes DNA repair capacity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> and is required for energy production in every tissue, such as the brain, immune cells, and muscle tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. A decrease in [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels means these tissues may not function properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

[[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is also essential for activating sirtuins, a family of enzymes involved in longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> and linked to metabolic processes and lifespan modulation through epigenetic regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Sirtuins use [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] to control gene activation related to energy metabolism, autophagy, circadian rhythm, DNA repair, and cell survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Benefits of [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD Boosters]] in Animal Studies

At very high doses in animal studies, [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] like [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] have been shown to improve the aging process in multiple tissues and cell types, including the heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and stem cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

*   **[[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Riboside]] (NR)**:
    *   Oral administration at high doses can counteract an obesogenic diet by improving insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
    *   It can improve endurance and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
    *   High-dose [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] reversed mitochondrial damage, increased mitochondrial biogenesis, and reversed muscular atrophy in animals with severe muscle wasting disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
    *   It showed positive effects on the brain in animals, including increased neurogenesis, decreased cognitive deterioration, reduced amyloid beta production, and increased synaptic plasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

*   **[[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Mononucleotide]] (NMN)**:
    *   High-dose injection countered an obesogenic diet and improved metabolic health markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   Improved heart function in animals with heart problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
    *   Improved cognition and memory in animals with neurodegenerative disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
    *   Long-term dietary administration mitigated age-associated physiological decline in mice with an accelerated aging phenotype, showing improved skeletal muscle function, mitochondrial function, increased energy expenditure, increased bone density, and decreased insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. These benefits were dose-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

## Potential Risks: Cancer Acceleration in Animal Studies

> [!WARNING] Potential Risk
> A recent study showed that [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] accelerated cancer growth in mice with a specific type of pancreatic cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This occurred in a context where pro-inflammatory senescent cells drove tumor growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
>
> Injected [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NMN]] (500 mg/kg body weight for 13 days) led to significant increases in precancerous and cancerous lesions in the pancreas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This effect was dependent on senescent cells, which secrete pro-inflammatory, immune-activating, growth-signaling, and angiogenesis-involved molecules that can drive cancer progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
>
> It is possible that [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] increases the tumorigenic quality of senescent cells, likely due to its role in energy metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. While this study focused on [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NMN]], it's plausible that [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] could show similar results in this specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. This does not mean these supplements cause or drive tumor progression in other cancer types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, but long-term animal studies are needed for confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Translational Challenges to Humans

Translating preclinical animal data to humans involves several important considerations:

### Dosage Discrepancies
*   **[[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Riboside]] (NR)**: Most rodent studies used a very high oral dose (around 400 mg/kg body weight), which translates to a human equivalent dose of approximately 2.6 grams per day for a 180-pound person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This dose is higher than any dose clinically tested in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **[[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Mononucleotide]] (NMN)**: Animal studies typically used very high doses (around 500 mg/kg body weight), often injected into the abdominal region, which is difficult to translate to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. An oral dose in a long-term aging study was 100 mg/kg body weight (human equivalent: 653 mg/day for a 180-pound person), with more robust benefits seen at 300 mg/kg body weight (human equivalent: 2 grams/day for a 180-pound person) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

### Bioavailability and Tissue Transport
A critical question is whether [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] or [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NMN]] can reach tissues intact and directly form [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] without going through the [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. The salvage pathway means they would first metabolize into nicotinamide before forming [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]], which is subject to feedback inhibition, limiting how high [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels can be raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

*   **Oral Doses**: An animal study using isotope tracers found that low oral doses (50 mg/kg body weight, human equivalent: 332 mg for a 180-pound person) of either [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] or [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NMN]] produced very low levels of directly-made [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] only in the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Higher oral doses of [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] (200 mg/kg body weight, human equivalent: 1.3 grams for a 180-pound person) showed no difference in direct [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] formation in tissues other than the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. However, more [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] from the salvage pathway was found in the kidney, muscle, and brain at the higher dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

*   **Intravenous Doses**: When [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] or [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NMN]] were given intravenously, directly produced [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] was found in the liver, kidney, and muscle in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. The only [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] detected in the brain was salvaged from nicotinamide, suggesting neither precursor directly crosses the blood-brain barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

    > [!INFO] Key Takeaway on Bioavailability
    > Even at very high oral doses, [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NMN]] don't appear to be directly transported to tissues other than the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. However, they are converted into nicotinamide, which can be transported to other tissues (including the brain) and then converted into [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] via the salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

### Human Clinical Data
As of the transcript date, there was no published evidence of oral [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] supplementation in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. However, two randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that oral [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] can increase [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels in white blood cells in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>:

*   **Study 1**: In an eight-week study of 120 healthy adults (60-80 years old), a 250 mg daily dose of [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] combined with pterostilbene (a sirtuin activator) increased whole blood [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. A double dose (500 mg) increased levels by 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. The lower dose also showed reduced diastolic blood pressure and lower levels of a liver damage marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>, though it's unclear if [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]], pterostilbene, or both were responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
*   **Study 2**: A six-week trial involving 60 middle-aged and older adults (55-79 years old) found that a 500 mg dose of [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] twice daily (total 1 gram/day) was well-tolerated and increased [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels in white blood cells by 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. Improvements in blood pressure and aortic stiffness were observed but were not statistically significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] had no effects on metabolic function, motor function, or exercise capacity/performance in this study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

### Stability of Supplements
[[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide riboside]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] both break down into nicotinamide over time, especially in conditions of high humidity or heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. This is notable because supplemental nicotinamide may reduce sirtuin activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. Keeping these supplements cold generally maintains their stability and prevents significant breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] is crucial for survival, energy metabolism, and DNA repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Its levels decline with age due to chronic inflammation, immune activation, and decreased production/recycling, leading to metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction and increased DNA damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] can be increased through lifestyle factors like exercise and fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, or through [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] such as [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide mononucleotide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.

While animal data on [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] is promising for improving aspects of aging and associated physiological decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>, concerns exist regarding human equivalent dosages, bioavailability to tissues beyond the liver, and potential acceleration of specific cancers in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Human studies have primarily shown that oral [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | nicotinamide riboside]] can increase [[nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_nad_and_its_precursors | NAD]] levels in white blood cells in the short term and appear safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. However, long-term safety and efficacy in humans remain open questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. More research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn about their widespread use for [[role_of_supplements_in_performance_and_longevity | performance and longevity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

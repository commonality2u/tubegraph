Resveratrol is a molecule produced by stressed plants, such as grapes, in response to conditions like fungus or lack of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. The concentration of resveratrol and other beneficial [[polyphenols_and_their_role_in_health | polyphenol]] molecules in red wine grapes can be boosted by a dry season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.

## Mechanism of Action
Resveratrol works by activating sirtuin enzymes, which are a class of [[longevity_genes | longevity genes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. These enzymes control gene expression and lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. While NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) acts as the "fuel" for sirtuins, resveratrol functions as an "accelerator pedal," making them work even faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The sirtuins have evolved to sense the plant world, meaning that ingesting molecules from stressed plants, like resveratrol, can trigger the body to become fitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>. This process is known as hormesis, where a small stressor elicits a beneficial response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.

Resveratrol activates stress response pathways in the body, turning on genes that help deal with stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. This activation potentially helps the body cope better with aging, which is itself a form of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

## Observed Effects

### Animal Studies
*   **Mice**:
    *   In 2006, a study showed that mice on a high-fat diet supplemented with resveratrol were "extremely healthy and longer lived" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. Their organs, particularly arteries, appeared pristine and free of fatty lumps, unlike those without resveratrol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>. [[effects_of_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health_and_cancer_prevention | Oxidative stress]] in the arteries of treated mice was significantly reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.
    *   Some of resveratrol's effects, such as improved endurance, appear to be mediated through SIRT1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>.
*   **Rhesus Monkeys**: A compelling primate study demonstrated that resveratrol significantly ameliorated the negative effects of a high-sucrose, high-fat diet, which typically caused a 40% increase in aortic stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.

### Human Studies
*   **Cardiovascular Health**: Resveratrol appears to be important for the cardiovascular system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>, potentially through SIRT1's anti-inflammatory actions in endothelial cells and dampened infiltration of macrophages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. Dr. Sinclair, who has been taking resveratrol since 2003, noted that his heart appears to be 20 years old with no signs of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>.
*   **Alzheimer's Disease**: Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies have shown that 500 mg to 1000 mg of resveratrol daily led to a reduction in amyloid beta 42 in cerebral spinal fluid and an improvement in cognitive function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.
*   **Autophagy**: Resveratrol appears to activate autophagy, a cellular process important for clearing out damaged proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. This is linked to the sirtuins' function as histone deacetylases, leading to a decrease in protein acetylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.
*   **Endurance Exercise**: One study indicated that resveratrol interfered with [[impact_of_exercise_intensity_on_cardiovascular_health_and_longevity | endurance exercise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>.

## Factors Affecting Efficacy
*   **Insolubility**: Resveratrol is a very insoluble molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. Absorption can be increased five to tenfold when consumed with some fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.
*   **Light Sensitivity**: Resveratrol is light-sensitive and degrades, turning brown, if not kept in the dark and cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
*   **Forms**: The *trans* form of resveratrol has been shown to activate sirtuin enzymes, whereas the *cis* form did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>.

## Personal Use
Dr. David Sinclair takes approximately a gram of resveratrol every morning mixed in yogurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. He stores it in a cold, dark place, such as a basement, to prevent degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.

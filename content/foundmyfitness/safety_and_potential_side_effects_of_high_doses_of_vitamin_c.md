Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is widely recognized as a potent antioxidant and a critical component of the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. While generally considered safe, especially at moderate doses, higher intakes and different administration methods (oral vs. intravenous) can have varying effects and potential side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>.

## Oral Vitamin C Safety and Tolerability

The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for healthy men is 90 milligrams per day, and for women, it is 75 milligrams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. The tolerable upper intake limit for oral vitamin C is 2,000 milligrams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This limit is set because taking really large doses of oral vitamin C can cause gastrointestinal (GI) issues, such as diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

Despite the established upper limit, there is no scientific evidence that oral vitamin C administered in doses up to 10 grams per day in adults is toxic or detrimental to health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. For most healthy people, vitamin C intakes above the RDA are well tolerated and safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>.

## Intravenous Vitamin C Safety and Side Effects

Intravenous (IV) vitamin C, which bypasses intestinal absorption and saturable transport mechanisms, can achieve much higher plasma concentrations (30 to 70 times higher than oral intake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:10">[02:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:10">[02:10:10]</a>. This method of administration is generally well tolerated and has low toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27">[01:15:27]</a>.

Commonly reported side effects of IV vitamin C include:
*   Mild to moderate nausea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>
*   Headache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>
*   Dry mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>

Less common side effects include:
*   Fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>
*   Hypertension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>
*   Loss of appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>
*   Hyperglycemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>

Serious side effects have been reported with high-dose IV vitamin C in patients with cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>.

## Specific Medical Conditions and Vitamin C Supplementation

[[benefits_of_vitamin_and_mineral_supplementation | Vitamin C]] supplementation is not advisable in some medical conditions:

*   **Hemochromatosis:** Individuals with abnormally high iron levels should exercise caution when considering vitamin C supplementation due to its propensity to improve the absorption of dietary iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency:** People with a deficiency in the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase are at risk of hemolysis (the rupturing of red blood cells) when given high doses (40 grams or higher) of intravenous vitamin C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. However, case reports suggest that at lower IV doses (1 to 10 grams), vitamin C might actually reduce hemolysis, indicating it could be safe in such individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>.

## Kidney Stone Risk

A significant concern for many people is the perceived risk of developing kidney stones when taking high oral doses of vitamin C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.

*   **Mechanism:** Some studies suggest that vitamin C intake is a risk factor for kidney stones due to the formation of oxalate, an end-product of vitamin C metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>. When high amounts of oxalate are present, it can form crystal structures with calcium, potentially leading to kidney stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.
*   **Kidney Impairment:** A small number of case reports indicate that oxalate nephropathy (oxalate calcium crystals forming in the kidney) has been observed in patients with pre-existing kidney impairment who were given high doses of intravenous vitamin C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>.
*   **Healthy Individuals:** Large prospective cohort studies have found that high vitamin C intake increases the *relative risk* of kidney stones, but these findings are considered misleading due to statistical manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. In reality, patients with high vitamin C intake did not experience more kidney stone events than those with lower intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>. A Swedish study involving over 48,000 men found a kidney stone risk of 0.16% per year for non-supplementers versus 0.3% per year for those who supplemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. While this is a statistical difference, it has no clinical significance, meaning a person supplementing could expect a kidney stone every 323 years, compared to every 613 years for non-supplementers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.
*   **Conclusion:** High-dose [[differences_between_oral_and_intravenous_vitamin_c | vitamin C]] might lead to kidney stones in patients with pre-existing kidney impairments, but for most healthy individuals, vitamin C poses a relatively low risk of developing kidney stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>. Studies of high-dose intravenous vitamin C in cancer patients have not reported any impairments in kidney function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>.

```ad-note
The seemingly contradictory findings in much of the research on [[benefits_of_vitamin_and_mineral_supplementation | vitamin C]] often arise from [[methodological_issues_in_vitamin_research_studies | differences in study design]], populations, dose, and delivery modalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.

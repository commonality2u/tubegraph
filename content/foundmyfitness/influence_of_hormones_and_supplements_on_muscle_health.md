Dr. Stuart Phillips, Director of the Physical Activity Center of Excellence at McMaster University, has made significant contributions to the understanding of [[role_of_protein_in_muscle_building_and_metabolism | muscle protein synthesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. His research sheds light on the complex interplay of hormones, dietary protein, and [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | exercise]] in maintaining and building [[role_of_exercise_and_muscle_mass_in_overall_health | muscle mass]], particularly as we age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Hormonal Influences on Muscle
When considering the [[role_of_exercise_and_muscle_mass_in_overall_health | role of exercise and muscle mass in overall health]], hormones play a more nuanced role than often perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

### Testosterone
While supraphysiological doses of testosterone (e.g., steroids) certainly increase [[role of protein and supplements in muscle gain | muscle gain]] and strength, the transient fluctuations of testosterone from exercise or normal diurnal variation do not significantly impact [[role_of_protein_in_muscle_building_and_metabolism | muscle protein synthesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>.
*   **Steroids vs. Normal Levels**: High exogenous steroid use (two to three standard deviations above normal) leads to significant [[role of protein and supplements in muscle gain | muscle gain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. However, within the normal physiological range, men and women demonstrate similar relative [[role of protein and supplements in muscle gain | muscle gain]] from [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | resistance training]], despite men starting with higher muscle mass and testosterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>.
*   **Androgen Deprivation Therapy**: Men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer lose [[role of protein and supplements in muscle gain | muscle mass]], indicating the importance of basal testosterone levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.
*   **Testosterone-Boosting Supplements**: Many supplements marketed to boost testosterone have not shown efficacy over 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
    *   [!NOTE] **Phillips's Three Rules of Supplements**:
        1.  If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>.
        2.  If it's too good to be true, it's probably banned, or you need a big prescription for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>.
        3.  There may be some exceptions, but they are very few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

### Growth Hormone (GH)
Growth hormone primarily stimulates stature and bone growth during development, and in adults, it's effective for collagen synthesis (e.g., tendons) and fat mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>. It does not significantly increase muscle mass in adults at normal physiological levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:59">[01:27:59]</a>. Chronic elevation of GH, similar to excessive testosterone, can lead to uncontrolled tissue growth and potentially increase cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:44">[01:18:44]</a>.

### Estrogen
The loss of estrogen during menopause contributes to [[effects_of_aging_on_muscle_mass and protein synthesis | muscle mass loss]] in women, indicating its role in [[role_of_protein_in_muscle_building_and_metabolism | protein synthesis]] stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>.

### Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1)
IGF-1 is a pro-growth factor, but in adults, it's not a primary stimulatory or inhibitory hormone for muscle repair or recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. The [[supplements_for_athletic_performance_and_recovery | restorative process]] and recovery are mainly driven by macronutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>.

## Supplements for Muscle Health

### Leucine and Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)
Leucine, one of the three branched-chain amino acids, is the most potent activator of muscle protein synthesis, acting like a "dimmer switch" to turn on the process via mTOR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.
*   **Leucine Supplementation**: Supplementing with leucine can improve the [[role_of_protein_in_muscle_building_and_metabolism | muscle protein synthetic response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>. However, it is "extraordinarily bitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.
    *   For older individuals, a per-meal leucine dose of 3-4 grams may be beneficial, while for younger people, 2-3 grams is often sufficient due to higher sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>.
    *   Supplementing leucine can help older individuals, especially those with reduced appetite or difficulty chewing, to reach sufficient anabolic stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.
*   **BCAAs**: While popular, BCAA supplements (which contain leucine, isoleucine, and valine) are largely ineffective because only leucine significantly drives muscle protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. For individuals already consuming adequate protein, BCAAs offer little additional benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>.
*   **Food First Approach**: It is generally recommended to prioritize obtaining protein from whole foods before considering isolated amino acid supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.

### Omega-3 Fatty Acids
Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly at high doses, have shown benefits in countering [[omega3s_impact_on_muscle_health_and_muscle_preservation | muscle atrophy]] and aiding recovery from disuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:18">[01:38:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>. This effect is considered "anti-catabolic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:41">[01:38:41]</a>.
*   Studies in younger and older women showed that omega-3 supplementation led to milder disuse atrophy and faster recovery compared to placebo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:18">[01:38:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:24">[01:38:24]</a>.
*   [[omega3s_effects_on_muscle_protein_synthesis_and_mitochondrial_function | Omega-3s effects on muscle protein synthesis and mitochondrial function]] likely involve their role in resolving inflammation, which can be catabolic to muscle in chronic low-grade or diseased states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">[01:39:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>.

### Creatine Monohydrate
Creatine monohydrate is one of the few supplements with consistent evidence for its benefits in [[role of protein and supplements in muscle gain | muscle gain]] and [[supplements_for_athletic_performance_and_recovery | athletic performance and recovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06">[01:44:06]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: It offers mild but potent effects on muscle, with growing evidence for brain health and cognitive performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06">[01:44:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:10">[01:44:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:45">[01:47:45]</a>. It can be beneficial for both younger and older individuals, including those with compromised muscle function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:18">[01:45:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:36">[01:45:36]</a>.
*   **Safety**: Decades of research have shown no significant safety concerns, with adverse events being rare and usually linked to other supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>.
*   **Dosage & Form**: A daily dose of about 4-5 grams is often recommended, and the monohydrate form is the most studied and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:49">[01:46:49]</a>.

### Collagen
Growth hormone is "really good for collagen" synthesis, which strengthens tendons and the collagenous proteins within muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This suggests that collagen supplements, which stimulate collagenous tissue synthesis, might have benefits for joint and connective tissue health rather than direct muscle mass gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.

### Vitamin D
Vitamin D is acknowledged as a beneficial supplement, especially in northern latitudes with less sunlight, due to widespread deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:22">[01:36:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>. It acts as a steroid hormone, regulating gene expression and impacting more than just bone homeostasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:40">[01:36:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:45">[01:36:45]</a>.

## General Principles Regarding Supplements and Hormones

*   **Foundation of Health**: The most impactful steps for health and longevity are maintaining a healthy body weight, engaging in consistent [[role of exercise and muscle mass in overall health | physical activity]], and paying attention to overall diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>.
*   **Exercise is Key**: [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | Exercise]], particularly [[effects_of_exercise_on_protein_metabolism_and_muscle_adaptation | resistance training]], is the primary driver of [[role of protein and supplements in muscle gain | muscle gain]] and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. Protein intake is a "thin layer on top" that offers additional, but smaller, benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
*   **Beware of "Anti-Aging" Clinics**: While clinically low hormone levels may warrant treatment, "anti-aging" clinics offering exogenous hormone supplementation without close monitoring could lead to overstimulation and potential health risks like cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:36">[01:22:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>. Prioritizing [[role of exercise and muscle mass in overall health | physical activity]] to lower cancer risk is crucial before considering hormone replacement therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:38">[01:24:38]</a>.

Research into the biological mechanisms that regulate the aging process has been ongoing for over 30 years, with significant breakthroughs in understanding why we age and how it might be reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Longevity Genes

A major breakthrough in the 1980s and early 1990s was the discovery of genes that control aging, often referred to as "longevity genes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These genes were first identified in organisms like nematode worms and yeast cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The same longevity genes are present in humans and almost every other life form on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Activities such as running or fasting are beneficial because they trigger these longevity genes to repair the body and slow down the aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For instance, in laboratory settings, nematode worms with a decreased insulin IGF-1 signaling pathway lived 100% longer and remained youthful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The visual observation of these changes in model organisms can be quite impactful for researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Sirtuins: Key Regulators of Longevity

Sirtuins are a class of enzymes that control gene expression (turning genes on and off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Their role in controlling lifespan was a significant discovery, as gene regulators were not initially expected to be central to aging, unlike antioxidants or DNA repair proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

When an extra copy of the SIR2 gene (one of the sirtuin genes) was introduced into yeast, those yeast lived 30% longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Subsequent research showed that this effect was due to the sirtuins mimicking [[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. A high level of sirtuins provides benefits similar to [[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | calorie restriction]], dieting, or other mild cellular stressors like heat or lack of amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Conversely, removing the SIR2 gene eliminates the benefits of [[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

This understanding formed the basis of much sirtuin research, which has found similar mechanisms at play in mammalian bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Sirtuins, Calorie Restriction, and Fasting

[[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | Calorie restriction]] typically refers to eating 30-40% less food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. In yeast, [[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | calorie restriction]] was achieved by dropping sugar levels in the Petri dish, which led to a longer lifespan while still allowing healthy growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

[[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | Intermittent fasting]] is also known to activate these longevity genes, including sirtuins, without requiring constant hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Both [[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | calorie restriction]] and [[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | intermittent fasting]] have beneficial health effects, though [[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | intermittent fasting]] involves a metabolic shift from glucose to fatty acid metabolism and ketogenesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

In a 2005 Science paper, researchers showed that [[dietary_interentios_in_longevity | calorie-restricted]] rats had dramatically increased levels of SIRT1 (one of the seven sirtuin genes) in their liver and muscle, up to five to tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This effect was also seen in cells grown in serum from [[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | calorie-restricted]] animals and was linked to low insulin and IGF-1 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This established a connection between sirtuins, [[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | calorie restriction]], and the insulin pathway in mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

While there were initial disagreements about which pathway (sirtuins, insulin/IGF-1, or mTOR) was most important, it is now understood that these pathways form an interconnected network, all influencing each other to promote [[longevity_strategies_and_advancements | long life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### NAD and Sirtuin Activity

Sirtuins require [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide plus)]] to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Without [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]], sirtuins are inactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD levels]] naturally rise during a fasted state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> and in response to exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD levels]] fluctuate throughout the day, rising during the day and decreasing after a large meal, and also play a role in regulating circadian rhythms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

[[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]] is crucial for metabolism, including metabolizing glucose and fatty acids, and is essential for mitochondrial function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. It is also important for activating sirtuins and DNA repair enzymes like PARP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]], ATP, and amino acids are considered the three main molecules sensed by the body to determine environmental conditions and trigger survival or growth responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. These pathways (sirtuins, AMP kinase/metformin, and mTOR/rapamycin) are ancient, existing for over 3 billion years, which may explain their profound effects on animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

[[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD levels]] decrease with age, with levels at age 50 potentially being half of what they were at age 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This decline in [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]] is believed to play a causal role in aging, as lower [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]] means sirtuins work less effectively at repairing the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Raising [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD levels]] back to youthful concentrations can "trick" the body into thinking it's young, exercising, or dieting, allowing sirtuins to perform their functions as they once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

Aging also involves a loss of the body's ability to make [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]] and increased consumption of [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]] by processes like the immune system and DNA repair (via PARPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This creates a vicious cycle where DNA damage accumulates, further draining [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]] and overwhelming sirtuins, leading to a loss of cellular identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

Sirtuins also play a direct role in DNA repair, being among the first proteins to arrive at a broken chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. They help recruit other repair proteins, and without SIRT1, DNA repair is inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

### Resveratrol and Sirtuins

Resveratrol, a molecule found in stressed plants like grapes (especially in dry seasons or when exposed to fungus), activates sirtuins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. This is an example of xenohormesis, where consuming stressed plants can trigger beneficial stress responses in the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. Resveratrol acts as an "accelerator pedal" for sirtuins, making them work faster, complementing [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]] which serves as their "fuel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The combination of [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]] boosters and resveratrol is believed to be more effective than either alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

Resveratrol research in animals has shown significant benefits. A study in rhesus monkeys on a high-sucrose, high-fat diet found that resveratrol completely ameliorated a 40% increase in aortic stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. In mice on a high-fat diet, resveratrol made them extremely healthy and longer-lived, with pristine organs and reduced fatty deposits in arteries, despite still being obese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. These effects appear to be partly due to SIRT1's anti-inflammatory actions in blood vessel linings and its role in DNA repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>.

Clinical studies in Alzheimer's disease with 500-1000 mg/day of resveratrol showed reductions in amyloid-beta 42 in cerebrospinal fluid and improvements in cognitive function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>. Resveratrol also activates autophagy, a process of cellular cleansing, partly through its role as a histone deacetylase via sirtuins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.

However, resveratrol faces challenges: it is highly insoluble, requiring fat for better absorption (e.g., with yogurt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. It is also light-sensitive and degrades if not kept in the dark and cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. The *trans* form of resveratrol is the one that activates sirtuin enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>.

### NAD Boosters: NMN and NR

NAD precursors like NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) and NR (nicotinamide riboside) are being investigated as [[longevity_strategies and advancements | longevity strategies and advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.

*   **NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide)**: NMN is an immediate precursor to [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. It is absorbed by a transporter and converted to [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]] in one step inside the cell by an enzyme called NAMPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>. This conversion step is critical for boosting [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]] under stress, exercise, or [[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.
*   **NR (Nicotinamide Riboside)**: NR is a smaller version of NMN, lacking a phosphate group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. It must first have a phosphate added to become NMN, and then be linked to form [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

Both NMN and NR have been shown to raise [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | NAD levels]] in animals and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. In [[testing_and_identifying_longevity_compounds_in_model_organisms | mouse studies]], NMN has been shown to increase endurance, while NR did not at the same dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>. NMN has also shown to be more effective than NR in a mitochondrial disease model in animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>.

A 2016 "Cell" paper by Shin Imai's group showed that NMN given to normal mice delayed tissue aging in multiple organs over a year of treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>. Ongoing lifespan studies in mice with NMN are showing significant positive differences, including improved frailty and heart function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. In mice, NMN has also improved memory and slowed Alzheimer's progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>, and helped restore blood flow and regrow the vascular system in muscle and brain, mimicking exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.

### Challenges and Considerations for NAD Boosters in Humans

*   **Dose-dependency**: [[testing_and_identifying_longevity_compounds_in_model_organisms | Animal studies]] often use high doses (e.g., 400 mg/kg/day for NR in mice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. Lower doses may be insufficient to overcome the body's clearance mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. Human equivalent doses can be very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>.
*   **Stability**: Both NR and NMN are unstable if not kept cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. They can degrade into nicotinamide, which inhibits sirtuins and PARP, interfering with DNA repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.
*   **Human Clinical Trials**: While some clinical trials have shown NAD levels are raised, demonstrable effects on endpoints like endurance are still under investigation, and some studies have reported side effects like rashes and flushing with high NR doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>. More potent and timed-release NAD boosters are being developed as potential pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.

## Sirtuins and the Epigenetic Clock

The concept of the "information theory of aging" proposes that aging is fundamentally a loss of informational regulation over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This includes the loss of proper gene expression and cellular identity due to accumulating DNA damage that distracts sirtuins from their normal functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

The epigenetic clock, developed by Steve Horvath, measures biological age based on DNA methylation patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. Research suggests that sirtuin movement and distraction are intimately linked to the Horvath methylation clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>. The methylation patterns recorded by this clock may serve as a means to reset proteins to their youthful states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.

Scientists are working on identifying the genetic triggers that can reverse the Horvath clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. This involves manipulating the epigenome to restore eyesight and regrow optic nerves in old mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

### Yamanaka Factors

The Yamanaka factors (a set of four genes: O, S, K, and M) were discovered by Shinya Yamanaka, who won the Nobel Prize in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. These factors can reprogram an adult cell (e.g., a skin cell) back into a primitive, pluripotent stem cell that can then differentiate into various cell types, such as nerve cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. This process of resetting adult cells to a stem cell state demonstrates that aging is not a one-way street and that the genome's information can be rewound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

Juan Carlos Belmonte at the Salk Institute pioneered using these factors in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. While continuous activation of all four factors was lethal, cycling them (on for a few days, then off) led to healthier mice and extended the lifespan of premature aging mouse models by over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. This approach also improved wound and kidney healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

The mechanism is believed to involve resetting proteins that have "lost their way" and resetting the methylation clock, making the cell literally young again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. Current research focuses on using a subset of three Yamanaka factors (excluding the toxic Myc oncogene) delivered by viruses to old mice to reverse aging in specific tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Recent breakthroughs identified genes that not only trigger protein movement but also reset the Horvath clock once they are in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. These findings have potential implications for treating conditions like cancer and damaged neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

The field of [[longevity_strategies_and_advancements | longevity strategies and advancements]] is rapidly expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. While [[dietary_interventions_in_longevity | fasting]] and exercise can slow aging by activating defensive pathways and stabilizing the epigenome, more potent interventions, like epigenetic resetting with modified Yamanaka factors, are being explored for potential age reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

Safety remains a primary concern for such powerful age reversal techniques, as excessive cellular resetting can lead to tumor formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. Clinical trials are underway, particularly focusing on localized treatments like glaucoma in the eye, which is a difficult-to-treat disease where damage cannot currently be reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. The ultimate goal is to develop safe molecules that can replicate these effects, potentially in a pill or drip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

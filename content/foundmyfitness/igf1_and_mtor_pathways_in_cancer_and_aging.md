The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathways are considered major growth pathways in the human body, influencing both healthy growth and pathological conditions like aging and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Understanding and modulating these pathways through diet and lifestyle are key areas of interest in longevity research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The mTOR Pathway

mTOR, which stands for mammalian target of rapamycin, is a central piece of a protein complex that was found to be inhibited by the compound rapamycin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. David Sabatini's group at MIT identified the amino acid sensor for mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) in a paper published in "Science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

mTOR exists in two main complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), and its activity varies across different tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Role in Growth**: mTOR plays a very important role in protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Too little mTORC1 activity, for instance, can lead to muscle wasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Amino Acid Sensitivity**: The [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | mTOR pathway]] is clearly driven by amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Leucine, one of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), is the highest affinity amino acid sensor for mTORC1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Isoleucine and valine are virtually irrelevant in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   mTORC in muscle has a much higher affinity for leucine than mTORC1 in fat or hepatocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This evolutionary design ensures that in times of nutrient deprivation, muscle preferentially receives growth signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   While taking 5 grams of leucine during a workout is likely not harmful and has a short stay in the body, the optimal amounts of leucine (too much or too little) for overall health and [[longevity | aging]] are still being determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Connection to Aging and Disease**: Overactivity of mTOR is known to predispose individuals to [[Epigenetics and aging | aging]] and diseases associated with it, such as [[Cancer development and its relationship with cellular senescence | cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## The IGF-1 Pathway

[[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | IGF-1]] is another critical growth factor that increases mTOR activity, indicating that these pathways are interconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Regulation**: Both the [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | mTOR]] and [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | IGF-1]] pathways are regulated by amino acid intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Methionine has been identified as a highly active amino acid in driving the [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | IGF pathway]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Influence of Carbohydrates and Insulin**: Carbohydrates, indirectly via insulin, also play a role in regulating [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | IGF-1]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. As insulin levels decrease, [[IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) | IGFBP-3]] increases, which affects the amount of active or bioavailable IGF-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Similar to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and testosterone, these binding proteins play a crucial role in hormone availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Dual Role**: While [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | IGF-1]] is essential for positive outcomes like muscle growth, muscle repair, and neuronal growth, excessive [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | IGF-1]] can allow damaged cells to continue growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Dietary Strategies for Longevity

Given the roles of [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | IGF-1]] and [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | mTOR]] in [[Epigenetics and aging | aging]], dietary adjustments are pursued to optimize these pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Protein Intake**: The approach involves consuming the minimum amount of protein necessary to maintain and grow muscle mass, avoiding excess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The exact amount depends on the individual, timing, protein quality, and metabolic stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   **Carbohydrate Intake**: Carbohydrate intake is lowered to the lowest point that can be tolerated while maintaining the lowest possible fasting insulin levels (ideally below 3 or 4 IU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Post-meal glycemia and hyperinsulinemia are also managed, aiming to keep insulin below 30 within one hour of a 75-gram glucose challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. This aims to keep the "area under the curve" of insulin low over the course of a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.
*   **Fat Intake**: Fat serves as the caloric filler once protein and carbohydrate targets are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
*   **Individual Variation**: The optimal dietary composition varies significantly between individuals based on factors like insulin sensitivity, muscle mass, and glucose disposal capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. This can range from 40% carbohydrates and 20% protein to 20% carbohydrates and 15% protein, with the rest as fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

## Pathways, Cancer, and Aging

The strategies around [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | IGF-1]] and [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | mTOR]] are crucial because they act as amplifiers in the development of [[Cancer development and its relationship with cellular senescence | cancer]] and the progression of [[Cellular senescence and aging | aging]]-related diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### Cancer
Everyone has cancer cells in their body, but the immune system usually eradicates them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | IGF-1]] is not a cancer initiator, meaning it doesn't cause the initial damage to normal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Instead, it amplifies growth in already damaged cells, signaling them not to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   Refined carbohydrates and sugars are linked to [[Cancer development and its relationship with cellular senescence | cancer]] in epidemiological studies, possibly by initiating cellular damage and inflammatory processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   A diet high in refined carbohydrates that causes inflammation, combined with high protein intake that activates the [[role_of_igf1_in_aging_and_disease_prevention | IGF-1 pathway]], creates a dangerous synergy, promoting the growth of damaged cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### Aging and Chronic Diseases
People who live to 100 or beyond generally die from the same diseases as others, but at a later age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. The goal of longevity is to delay the onset of the "big three" diseases that kill 75% of people: cerebrovascular/cardiovascular disease, [[Cancer development and its relationship with cellular senescence | cancer]], and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

### Alzheimer's Disease and Insulin Resistance
Alzheimer's disease is viewed by some as "brain diabetes" due to its strong association with Type 2 diabetes and hyperinsulinemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. The increase in Alzheimer's incidence (about 2.5% per year over 50 years) outpaces the increase in longevity (0.6% per year), suggesting an environmental trigger beyond natural aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.

*   **Neuronal Energy Problem**: The primary driver of Alzheimer's is hypothesized to be a neuronal energy problem, where there is difficulty getting glucose through pyruvate dehydrogenase into the Krebs cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. Tau plaques and synapse issues are considered byproducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   **Therapeutic Approaches**: Richard Isaacson, a neurologist at Cornell, focuses on early cognitive decline by utilizing very-low-glycemic-index diets coupled with MCTs to induce ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.
*   **Insulin Sensitivity**: Being as insulin-sensitive as possible is believed to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and other disease states, though it doesn't eliminate risk entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

### Warburg Effect and Cancer Metabolism
Cancer cells often exhibit a Warburg effect, meaning they primarily rely on glycolysis for energy even in the presence of oxygen.
*   **Mitochondrial Function**: This phenomenon is not necessarily due to defective mitochondria, but rather an optimization by cancer cells for cellular building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. They prioritize inefficient ATP production in exchange for components needed for rapid cell division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>.
*   **Targeting Cancer Cells**: Cancer cells are "primed to die," with a delicate balance between pro-death and anti-apoptotic signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>.
    *   Forcing mitochondrial activity through agents like DCA (activating pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) or ketogenic diets (requiring oxidized fats) can generate reactive oxygen species, which act as pro-death signals and can kill cancer cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.
    *   This approach might be a better therapeutic strategy than chemotherapy, as it preferentially targets cancer cells while sparing normal cells that are not "primed to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.
    *   However, concerns exist that ketogenic diets, while forcing mitochondrial activity, also provide lipids that cancer cells can use as building blocks for new cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>.
*   **Antioxidants and Cancer**: Taking supplemental dietary antioxidants when one has cancer is considered dangerous because they blunt the reactive oxygen species signaling pathway, which normally promotes the death of cancer cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>.

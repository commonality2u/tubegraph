Lutein and zeaxanthin are two types of carotenoids that play a significant role in maintaining eye health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. These compounds are highly concentrated in the retina of the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Functions of Lutein and Zeaxanthin in the Eye

These carotenoids perform two primary functions to protect the eyes:
1.  **Blue Light Filtration**: They filter out singlet oxygen, which is produced by blue light from the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This singlet oxygen is very damaging to the rods and cones in the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
2.  **[[role_of_antioxidants_in_the_body | Antioxidant]] Activity**: Lutein and zeaxanthin possess [[role_of_antioxidants_in_the_body | antioxidant]] properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This activity helps protect against various forms of age-related macular degeneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Beyond protection, lutein and zeaxanthin have also been shown to slightly enhance visual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Dietary Sources

Kale is a notable source of lutein and zeaxanthin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. A micronutrient smoothie containing eight kale leaves can provide approximately 390 milligrams of both lutein and zeaxanthin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The absorption of carotenoids, including lutein and zeaxanthin, can be increased by consuming them with monounsaturated fat, such as that found in avocados <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

Magnesium is a vital mineral that plays a foundational yet often overlooked role in overall health and longevity, influencing numerous biological processes, including brain function and the aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20">[01:20]</a>. Approximately 45% of the US population has insufficient magnesium intake, primarily due to diets lacking sufficient dark leafy greens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58">[01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05">[02:05]</a>.

## Magnesium Deficiency and Overall Health
[[Magnesium deficiency and its health implications | Insufficient magnesium levels]] can have significant health implications, affecting crucial biological processes like DNA repair, replication, and transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25">[01:25]</a>. When these processes are compromised, it can lead to the development of potentially cancer-causing mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34">[01:34]</a>.

Magnesium acts as a co-factor for about 300 different enzymes in the body, which are specialized proteins essential for various functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44">[02:44]</a>. While these enzymes make up only about 0.4% of all enzymes, their roles are crucial for a wide range of bodily functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56">[02:56]</a>.

### Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA)
The recommended daily allowances for magnesium are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10">[03:10]</a>:
*   Adult women: 310 to 320 milligrams per day (increasing to 360 mg/day during pregnancy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12">[03:12]</a>
*   Adult men: 400 to 420 milligrams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20">[03:20]</a>
*   Athletes and individuals with high physical activity (including regular sauna users): may need an additional 10-20% above RDA due to greater loss through urine and sweat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25">[03:25]</a>.

Data from nutritional surveys like NHANES reveal that the average magnesium intake in the US often falls below the RDA, with women consuming around 230 mg/day and men about 320 mg/day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41">[03:41]</a>. The RDA represents the bare minimum to prevent severe diseases associated with [[Magnesium deficiency and its health implications | magnesium deficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12">[04:12]</a>.

### Dietary Sources and Bioavailability
Good dietary sources of magnesium include:
*   Dark leafy greens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08">[05:08]</a>
*   Legumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11">[05:11]</a>
*   Nuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11">[05:11]</a>
*   Seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11">[05:11]</a>
*   Whole grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11">[05:11]</a>
*   Brown rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13">[05:13]</a>
*   Fish like mackerel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14">[05:14]</a>

Magnesium is abundantly found in chlorophyll, which gives plants their green color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11">[02:11]</a>. The net absorption of dietary magnesium is only about 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16">[05:16]</a>. Poor bioavailability from plant sources is often due to magnesium being bound to phytate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33">[05:33]</a>. Bioavailability can be increased by activating phytase enzymes, which break down phytate, through methods like heating oats, cooking leafy greens or legumes, or germinating/sprouting grains and seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40">[05:40]</a>. Wheat and yeast also exhibit strong phytase activity during baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06">[06:06]</a>.

Factors that can limit magnesium bioavailability include:
*   **Excessive supplemental zinc:** Doses higher than 124 mg/day can inhibit magnesium absorption and other trace elements like copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34">[06:34]</a>. Short-term high doses (e.g., 80 mg/day for illness) are an exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56">[06:56]</a>.
*   **Diet composition:** The standard American diet, high in calories and low in micronutrients, contributes to widespread [[Magnesium deficiency and its health implications | magnesium insufficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33">[07:33]</a>. Processed foods, meats, and dairy are poor sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44">[07:44]</a>.
*   **Health conditions and lifestyle choices:** Diabetes and alcohol consumption can lead to increased magnesium excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25">[08:25]</a>. Alcohol acts as a diuretic, increasing urine production and magnesium loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34">[08:34]</a>.

### Assessing Magnesium Status
Blood tests, specifically plasma magnesium levels, are generally not good indicators of overall magnesium status in healthy adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03">[09:03]</a>. This is because the body tightly regulates plasma magnesium within a narrow range (0.7 to 1 mmol/L), often pulling magnesium from bone reservoirs to maintain these levels, even in cases of deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50">[09:50]</a>. Red blood cell magnesium tests may provide a better indication but still may not fully represent total body content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37">[10:37]</a>. Both tests are more likely to identify severe rather than mild or moderate [[Magnesium deficiency and its health implications | deficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51">[10:51]</a>.

The most practical approach to ensure adequate magnesium intake is to track and calculate dietary magnesium content using resources like the USDA's FoodData Central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06">[11:06]</a>. Plasma or red blood cell tests can still be useful to rule out severe deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33">[11:33]</a>.

### [[Magnesium supplements and their effectiveness | Magnesium Supplements]]
The US Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board set the upper safe limit for daily supplemental magnesium intake at 350 mg, a level unlikely to cause diarrhea or gastrointestinal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08">[12:08]</a>. Diarrhea is the first sign of excessive magnesium supplementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24">[12:24]</a>. This conservative dose does not include dietary magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32">[12:32]</a>.

For optimal bioavailability, it is more effective to take total daily doses in divided, smaller amounts rather than a single large dose, which also minimizes GI discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52">[12:52]</a>.

Organic magnesium salts (e.g., magnesium citrate, glycinate, taurate, malate) are generally more bioavailable and effectively raise plasma magnesium levels compared to inorganic forms (e.g., magnesium oxide, chloride, sulfate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26">[13:26]</a>. Organic in this context refers to the presence of carbon in the acid molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16">[14:16]</a>. Magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) is often used transdermally in baths, but its effectiveness through skin absorption is not conclusively proven, and there's no evidence it increases plasma magnesium levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45">[14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08">[10:08]</a>.

#### Magnesium L-Threonate
Magnesium L-threonate has gained attention for its potential impact on brain function due to animal evidence suggesting it can cross the blood-brain barrier more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00">[15:00]</a>. However, human studies are limited and industry-funded:
*   An initial 2016 study with 44 participants found only a marginal increase in plasma magnesium and no elevation in red blood cell magnesium levels after daily doses of 1,500-2,000 mg of magnesium L-threonate for 12 weeks, with most being excreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37">[17:37]</a>. Cognitive improvements were only observed when data from four different tests were pooled, suggesting statistical uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30">[18:30]</a>.
*   A 2022 study with 100 participants showed improved cognitive performance in a group receiving 400 mg of magnesium L-threonate *along with* vitamins C, D, B6, and phosphatidylserine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26">[19:26]</a>. The study design makes it difficult to attribute cognitive benefits solely to magnesium L-threonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57">[19:57]</a>.

Magnesium L-threonate is *not* the best option for meeting daily magnesium needs due to its very low elemental magnesium content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30">[00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51">[21:51]</a>. Its potential brain health benefits have not been definitively established, and its dose should not be counted towards RDA goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54">[00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20">[22:20]</a>.

## Magnesium's Impact on Brain Health
Recent research suggests a potential association between dietary magnesium intake and [[Impact of Micronutrients on Neurological Health | brain health]]. An observational study using UK Biobank data (over 6,000 participants aged 40-73) found that higher magnesium intake (around 550 mg/day) correlated with larger gray matter and hippocampal volumes, potentially conveying up to approximately one year of reduced brain aging compared to those with lower intakes (around 350 mg/day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07">[34:07]</a>. This link was particularly notable in women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54">[34:54]</a>.

Higher cerebral magnesium levels have been shown to decrease oxidative stress and inflammation, improve synaptic plasticity, and counteract mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:51">[35:51]</a>. A systematic review found that individuals with Alzheimer's disease have significantly lower plasma magnesium levels compared to healthy controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:03">[36:03]</a>.

Long-term observational studies suggest a link between higher magnesium intake and reduced risk of dementia or mild cognitive impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38">[36:38]</a>:
*   A 17-year study following over 1,000 middle-aged adults found that those who ate at least 196 mg/day of magnesium had a 37% lower chance of developing dementia compared to those consuming 174 mg/day or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38">[36:38]</a>.
*   Another study of people aged 60+ without dementia indicated that consuming at least 434 mg/day of magnesium might help prevent mild cognitive impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58">[36:58]</a>.
*   In over 2,500 mentally healthy older adults, intake over 407 mg/day was linked to better overall brain function, a benefit seen only in women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21">[37:21]</a>.

While these observational studies show associations, they cannot prove causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:39">[37:39]</a>.

### Role of Magnesium in Brain Enzymes
Magnesium is a vital co-enzyme for a variety of biochemical processes in the brain, serving as a key factor for brain-specific enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57">[37:57]</a>:
*   **ATPases:** Crucial for hydrolyzing ATP (the major energy source for cells), enzymes like sodium-potassium ATPase and calcium ATPase require magnesium to establish electrochemical gradients across neuronal membranes, essential for neuronal function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09">[38:09]</a>.
*   **Creatine:** Enzymes involved in creatine metabolism, which produces ATP, also require magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:48">[38:48]</a>.
*   **Glutamine Synthetase:** This enzyme, which requires magnesium, converts glutamate into ammonia and glutamine. Maintaining this balance is critical for preventing excitotoxicity and potential neuronal damage from excessive glutamate activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:21">[39:21]</a>.

### Magnesium and Migraines
Magnesium may play a role in managing migraines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:13">[40:13]</a>. It appears to help prevent cortical spreading depression, a wave of brain activity linked to migraine auras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:31">[40:31]</a>. Magnesium may also decrease the release of pain-transmitting chemicals like substance P and glutamate, and prevent serotonin-induced narrowing of brain blood vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48">[40:48]</a>.

Individuals suffering from migraines are often deficient or have insufficient magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11">[41:11]</a>. Randomized controlled trials indicate that magnesium supplementation can effectively reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine relapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41">[41:41]</a>. An effective dose for migraine prevention appears to be around 600 mg/day, which should be divided into smaller amounts (e.g., 200 mg three times daily) to minimize gastrointestinal discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:08">[42:08]</a>.

## Magnesium's Impact on Aging
Magnesium depletion is a slow process that can take years to manifest, contributing to aging and the development of chronic diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:21">[43:21]</a>.

### Triage Theory
Dr. Bruce Ames' Triage Theory suggests that when micronutrient resources like magnesium are limited, the body prioritizes certain biological processes critical for immediate survival over those vital for long-term health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:32">[43:32]</a>. For example, magnesium is crucial for enzymes involved in immediate energy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:41">[44:41]</a>. This prioritization means that processes vital for long-term health, such as DNA repair, may receive less magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50">[44:50]</a>.

While sufficient magnesium might be maintained in plasma by pulling from bone reservoirs to avoid acute deficiency, this can gradually set the stage for chronic issues like osteoporosis due to insidious damage accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01">[45:01]</a>.

### Cancer Prevention and Mortality
Magnesium plays a crucial role in DNA repair and replication, with implications for cancer prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:54">[45:54]</a>. It is essential for the proper functioning of DNA repair enzymes and DNA polymerases, the "workhorses" of cell division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:27">[46:27]</a>. Without adequate magnesium, these processes can be compromised, leading to potential errors and mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:05">[47:05]</a>. Magnesium deficiency can also upset the balance of Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes, potentially aiding cancer cell invasion and progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:18">[47:18]</a>.

Observational studies have shown associations between magnesium intake and cancer risk:
*   A study tracking over 66,000 men and women (aged 50-76) found that those with magnesium intake below the RDA had a significantly higher risk of pancreatic cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:16">[48:16]</a>. Specifically, those getting 75-99% of the RDA had a 42% increased risk, and those with less than 75% had a 76% increased risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:46">[48:46]</a>. Every 100 mg/day decrease in magnesium intake was associated with a 24% increase in pancreatic cancer incidence in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00">[49:00]</a>. This inverse association was more pronounced among those who took [[Magnesium supplements and their effectiveness | magnesium supplements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:25">[49:25]</a>.
*   The Paris Prospective Study 2, which followed 4,000 men (aged 30-60) for 18 years, found that men with the highest magnesium levels had a 40% lower [[Role of Magnesium in reducing allcause mortality | all-cause mortality]] and a 50% lower cancer death rate compared to those with the lowest levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:17">[50:17]</a>.

A meta-analysis examining both dietary and supplemental magnesium intake on mortality risks found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:31">[51:31]</a>:
*   Dietary magnesium intake was linked to a significantly lower risk of both [[Role of Magnesium in reducing allcause mortality | all-cause mortality]] and cancer mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:42">[51:42]</a>. For every additional 100 mg/day of dietary magnesium, there was a 6% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 5% reduction in cancer mortality in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50">[51:50]</a>. This benefit is likely due to the synergy of magnesium with other vital micronutrients and phytonutrients found in whole foods like leafy greens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:27">[52:27]</a>.
*   Supplemental magnesium intake showed a non-significant positive association with cancer mortality risk based on three studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:46">[52:46]</a>. Total magnesium intake (dietary + supplemental) did not show a significant association, possibly due to heterogeneity between studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:16">[53:16]</a>.

### Bone Health and Osteoporosis
Approximately 60% of the body's magnesium is stored in the bones, serving as a reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18">[09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:35">[54:35]</a>. As people age, magnesium losses from bones increase as the body pulls from this reservoir to maintain stable plasma levels when dietary intake is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:49">[54:49]</a>. Over a lifetime, nearly half of the bone's magnesium content can be lost, contributing to osteoporosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:43">[55:43]</a>.

Adequate [[importance_of_magnesium_in_the_diet | magnesium intake]] early in life is crucial for long-term bone health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:00">[56:00]</a>. Studies show magnesium-rich diets in pre-adolescence positively affect bone density in young adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:20">[56:20]</a>. A year-long magnesium supplementation study found it enhanced bone mass in the hips of peripubertal girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:33">[56:33]</a>. This highlights magnesium's crucial role, beyond just calcium, in building strong bones and preventing osteoporosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:47">[56:47]</a>.

### [[Magnesiums Role in Metabolic Processes and Aging | Magnesium and Vitamin D Metabolism]]
Magnesium plays a critical role in [[Vitamin D and its impact on brain development and dysfunction | vitamin D metabolism]], which is vital for calcium absorption and bone health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:56">[57:56]</a>. Magnesium acts as a co-factor for several enzymes that convert vitamin D3 into 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the main circulating form measured in blood tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:17">[58:17]</a>.

The synergy between magnesium and vitamin D is evident:
*   High intake of magnesium (from diet or supplements) is linked to a lower risk of having low vitamin D levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:07">[59:07]</a>.
*   Adequate magnesium intake enhances the body's ability to maintain healthy vitamin D levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:27">[59:27]</a>.
*   Low magnesium intake (affecting nearly half the US population) can hinder the body's ability to utilize vitamin D effectively, even if vitamin D intake is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:39">[59:39]</a>.
*   Benefits of higher vitamin D levels in reducing the risk of death (especially from cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer) are more significant in individuals with above-average magnesium intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:56">[00:59:56]</a>.
*   A randomized control trial showed that for people with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (indicating deficiency), [[Magnesium supplements and their effectiveness | magnesium supplementation]] effectively increased these levels, aiding in the conversion of vitamin D3 into its more stable circulating form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>.

This intricate relationship suggests that [[mechanisms_of_vitamin_d_in_supporting_brain_health | magnesium's influence on vitamin D status]] is not one-size-fits-all, playing a critical role in stabilizing, converting, and activating vitamin D based on individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. This also highlights potential flaws in nutritional trials that do not account for baseline nutrient levels or nutrient interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.

## Other Related Roles in Health
### Stress Response
The body's stress response, involving hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can lead to a reduction or depletion of magnesium levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21">[02:21]</a>. Stress hormones cause the body to use up more magnesium to manage reactions, reducing overall available magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33">[02:33]</a>. Studies show that adrenaline infusion can significantly lower magnesium levels, which remain reduced for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40">[02:40]</a>. Persistent or intermittent stress (e.g., anticipating military conflict, sleep deprivation, exam time, noise exposure) can decrease magnesium levels in blood and red blood cells, and increase urinary magnesium excretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47">[02:47]</a>.

Both mental and physical stress (like prolonged exercise) deplete magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54">[02:54]</a>. The "fight or flight" response mobilizes magnesium for energy production, leading to a temporary surge in serum magnesium, but prolonged stress depletes body stores as magnesium is extracted and expelled through urination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51">[02:51]</a>. Cortisol signals the kidneys to excrete more magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58">[02:58]</a>.

### Sleep
Observational studies suggest that adults with higher dietary magnesium intake often report better sleep quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49">[02:49]</a>. While a meta-analysis of some randomized controlled trials suggests [[Magnesium supplements and their effectiveness | magnesium supplementation]] can improve certain sleep metrics (e.g., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores, sleep efficiency, duration), results across studies are mixed, with many showing no effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[03:03]</a>. This inconsistency likely stems from trials not assessing baseline magnesium deficiency in participants, as only about half the population may benefit from supplementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a>.

### Blood Pressure (Hypertension)
Hypertension affects nearly half of US adults, including 20% of young adults aged 18-39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26">[03:26]</a>. Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and dementia later in life, particularly with cumulative exposure to high blood pressure starting at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48">[03:48]</a>.

Magnesium helps control blood pressure by:
*   Boosting production of prostacyclin and nitric oxide, which relax blood vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37">[03:37]</a>.
*   Aiding in vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), making it easier for the heart to pump blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47">[03:47]</a>.
*   Fighting inflammation and protecting against damage to blood vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57">[03:57]</a>.

A meta-analysis of 34 randomized control trials (over 2,000 participants) found that [[Magnesium supplements and their effectiveness | magnesium supplementation]] at an average dose of 368 mg/day notably lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16">[05:16]</a>. Laboratory studies support magnesium's ability to adjust vascular smooth muscle function, reduce vascular resistance, combat hypertension, prevent vasoconstriction, and provide antioxidant properties in the vascular system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51">[05:51]</a>.

### Muscle Cramps
Magnesium is essential for muscle contraction and relaxation, and its deficiency can lead to increased muscle excitability and cramps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06">[07:06]</a>. However, data on [[Magnesium supplements and their effectiveness | magnesium supplementation]] for muscle cramps is mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32">[07:32]</a>. Some studies suggest benefits, particularly in pregnant women, but the broader picture is complex, likely because not all studies check for baseline magnesium deficiency, and muscle cramps have diverse causes not all related to magnesium levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40">[07:40]</a>.

The effectiveness of Epsom salt baths for muscle cramps via transdermal absorption of magnesium is scientifically unproven, with no conclusive evidence that they increase plasma magnesium levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24">[07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29">[07:29]</a>. While some studies suggest Epsom salt (Dead Sea salt) can improve skin barrier function and hydration, its impact on muscle cramps through the skin lacks scientific validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45">[07:45]</a>.

## Conclusion
Magnesium holds a pivotal place in neuroscience, physical health, and longevity, with its contributions extending to metabolic health, cardiovascular function, and cognitive processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. The evidence suggests that a tailored approach, recognizing individual health statuses and existing nutrient levels, is important for magnesium supplementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.

Dr. Rhonda Patrick emphasizes the importance of diversity in ingredients for salads and smoothies to ensure a balanced intake of [[micronutrient_smoothie_ingredients_and_preparation | micronutrients]], plant hormetic compounds, and [[prebiotics_and_their_benefits | prebiotics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach helps in acquiring a wide range of beneficial compounds rather than an excess of just a few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Smoothie Ingredients

The recipe includes:
*   Eight kale leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Two rainbow chard leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   One tomato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   One large carrot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   Two celery stalks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Eight pieces of parsley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   One apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Two cups of spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   One lemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   One to two cups of blueberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   One avocado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   Quarter cup of hydrolyzed collagen powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   Two cups of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

## General Micronutrient Benefits

This smoothie is rich in various [[micronutrient_and_fiber_importance | micronutrients]] essential for bodily functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **[[health_benefits_of_magnesium_and_sources | Magnesium]]**: High in the smoothie, [[health_benefits_of_magnesium_and_sources | magnesium]] is a cofactor for over 300 enzymes and is central to the chlorophyll molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Approximately 45% of the U.S. population has inadequate [[health_benefits_of_magnesium_and_sources | magnesium]] intake, often due to insufficient consumption of greens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Folate**: Abundant in greens, folate is crucial for producing the nucleic acid thymine. Its absence can lead to uracil being substituted for thymine, causing DNA strand breaks similar to being irradiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Other Vitamins and Minerals**: The smoothie also provides vitamins K1, C, E, beta-carotene (converted to vitamin A), calcium, and potassium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Plant Hormetic Compounds

Plant hormetic compounds differ from [[micronutrient_and_fiber_importance | micronutrients]] because they are biologically stressful at a cellular level, triggering beneficial stress response pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The cell "over responds" to this slight toxic insult, leading to positive effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. These compounds help the body and brain deal with stress more effectively, providing both short- and long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Many are known as polyphenols or flavonols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Isothiocyanates
These compounds, found in kale and other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli sprouts, possess potent anti-cancer properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   They inhibit Phase 1 biotransformation enzymes, which convert pro-carcinogens into active carcinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   They activate Phase 2 detoxification enzymes (e.g., glutathione reductase), which reduce DNA and cellular damage by lowering inflammation and reactive oxygen species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. These enzymes also inactivate pro-carcinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   Generally, a lower level of Phase 1 and higher level of Phase 2 enzymes is desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Isothiocyanates are effective at preventing cancer initiation in both animal and human studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Luteolin and Apigenin
Celery and parsley contribute luteolin and apigenin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Luteolin**: A flavonoid that decreases inflammation by reducing the expression of inflammation-related genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. A study of over 66,000 women showed that high luteolin intake correlated with a 34% decrease in cancer incidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Luteolin also slows cognitive decline in older mice, making their brains function like younger counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Apigenin**: Also a flavonoid, apigenin promotes neural stem cells to form new neurons and strengthens neural connections, important for learning and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. It has also been shown to kill cancer cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Blueberries
Blueberries are rich in various plant hormetic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Anthocyanins**: High in blueberries, anthocyanins are potent plant hormetic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. They have been shown to prevent cognitive and behavioral deficits in mice genetically engineered to develop Alzheimer's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Specifically, anthocyanins activate NRF2, a master regulator of genes involved in inflammation and antioxidant activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Pterostilbene**: Chemically similar to resveratrol, pterostilbene activates the gene PPAR alpha, lowering triglyceride and blood glucose levels in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. It has also been shown to be more potent than resveratrol in improving cognitive function in prematurely aging mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Apples
Apples, particularly their skin, contain ursolic acid and glucaric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Ursolic Acid**: Found in apple skin, it has been shown to increase muscle mass by 10% and muscle strength by 30% in mice fed a diet containing 0.27% ursolic acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This occurs by inhibiting ATF4, a gene that normally prevents protein synthesis in muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Glucaric Acid**: Inhibits an enzyme in certain bacteria that converts pro-carcinogens from environmental and dietary factors into their active carcinogenic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Fiber and Prebiotics

Using a high-powered blender instead of a juicer retains [[micronutrient_and_fiber_importance | fiber]], which is highly beneficial and often lacking in modern diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Traditional hunter-gatherer societies consumed significantly more fiber (up to 10 times) than modern diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

Many types of fiber are fermentable, acting as [[prebiotics_and_their_benefits | prebiotics]] that nourish beneficial gut bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Eating a diverse array of vegetables and fruits provides various [[prebiotics_and_their_benefits | prebiotics]] that support different microbial species, thereby increasing microbial diversity in the gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Pectin**: Present in berries and apple skin, pectin is a beneficial [[prebiotics_and_their_benefits | prebiotic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Sulfoquinovose**: Found in green leafy vegetables, it also feeds beneficial gut bacteria, protecting the gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Non-fermentable Fiber**: Vegetables also contain non-fermentable fibers like lignins and cellulose (present in plant cell walls), which aid food and waste movement through the gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

The Mayo Clinic recommends men consume at least 38 grams of fiber per day and women at least 25 grams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, which is significantly more than the estimated 10 grams Americans typically consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Hydrolyzed Collagen Powder

Hydrolyzed collagen powder is included for its non-essential amino acids, particularly glycine and proline, which are crucial for collagen synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Collagen makes up 25-35% of total body protein and is abundant in ligaments, tendons, cartilage, skin, blood vessels, muscle, gut, and teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The body continuously manufactures new collagen to repair connective tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

Research indicates that ingested hydrolyzed collagen is partially degraded into individual amino acids and absorbed, while some is absorbed fully intact and accumulates in cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Proline**: Abundant in hydrolyzed collagen, proline can be converted into glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate, which mitochondria can use to produce ATP, especially during catabolic conditions when glucose is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Proline also appears to play a role in wound healing, with its levels rising significantly at wound sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Glycine**: Also very abundant in hydrolyzed collagen, glycine is an anti-inflammatory signaling molecule and an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

## Addressing "Antinutrients"

Concerns about "antinutrients" in raw vegetables, such as kale and spinach, are often raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

### Isothiocyanates (in Kale)
Isothiocyanates, the beneficial plant hormetic compounds with anti-cancer properties, have been referred to as "goitrogens" because they can compete for iodine transport into the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. However, high levels of isothiocyanates from cruciferous vegetables have not been shown to increase hypothyroidism unless accompanied by severe iodine deficiency, which is uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. Countless animal studies demonstrate that large quantities of isothiocyanates do not cause hypothyroidism but instead inhibit cancer formation and initiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### Oxalate (in Spinach)
Oxalate, present in spinach, has raised concerns about increased kidney stone risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. While boiling spinach does reduce soluble oxalate (the type absorbed by intestines), [[health_benefits_of_magnesium_and_sources | magnesium]] and calcium ions cause oxalate to become insoluble, making it unabsorbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Both [[health_benefits_of_magnesium_and_sources | magnesium]] and calcium ions dramatically decrease oxalate absorption in healthy volunteers to less than 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. The smoothie itself is rich in [[health_benefits_of_magnesium_and_sources | magnesium]] and calcium, substantially reducing the amount of soluble oxalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

Dr. Rhonda Patrick reports no kidney or thyroid irregularities in her blood work after consuming this smoothie several days a week for five years, suggesting that the benefits of isothiocyanates outweigh potential theoretical risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

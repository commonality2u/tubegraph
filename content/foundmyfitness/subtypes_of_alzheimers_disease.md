[[Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] (AD) is the most common cause of [[Genetic and environmental factors influencing dementia | cognitive decline]] leading to dementia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. By definition, AD is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau tangles in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. However, the presence of these markers does not fully explain the cause of the disease, as some individuals can have amyloid plaques without experiencing [[Genetic and environmental factors influencing dementia | cognitive decline]], and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The traditional understanding of [[Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] is undergoing a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. While amyloid is known to be a neurotoxin with toxic effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, it also serves as a protectant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. It is produced by the brain in response to specific insults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, acting as an antimicrobial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> and a binder of divalent metals like copper, zinc, and iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Its production can also be a response to reduced trophic support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This complexity has led to the identification of multiple contributing factors and distinct subtypes of [[Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Dr. Dale Bredesen and colleagues have identified 36 different factors contributing to [[Alzheimers Disease | AD]], which can be categorized into several subtypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Subtypes of Alzheimer's Disease

### Type 1: Inflammatory or "Hot" Alzheimer's Disease

This subtype is characterized by chronic inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It is a response to various pathogens or inflammatory conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Factors contributing to Type 1 AD include:
*   **Leaky gut** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
*   Presence of pathogens like *P. gingivalis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, *Borrelia* (Lyme disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, or specific fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
In this subtype, amyloid acts like "napalm" to kill invaders, but in doing so, it damages the brain's neural network, leading to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Type 2: Atrophic or "Cold" Alzheimer's Disease

This type results from decreased trophic (nutritional and growth) support to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This leads to a reduction in the brain's ability to support its neural network, causing a downsizing of synapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Key factors include deficiencies in:
*   Nerve growth factor (NGF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   Estradiol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   Testosterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   Pregnenolone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   Progesterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   Thyroid hormones (free T3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   Vitamin D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>

These factors are critical for synaptogenesis (formation of new synapses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The signaling shifts from synaptoblastic activity (making and storing synapses) to synaptoclastic activity (pulling back and reorganizing synapses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Type 1.5: Glycotoxic Alzheimer's Disease

This is a hybrid type combining features of both Type 1 (inflammatory) and Type 2 (atrophic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. It primarily stems from [[Alzheimers Disease and Insulin Sensitivity | insulin resistance]] and chronic high insulin levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   High insulin leads to changes in signaling, reducing insulin's role as a trophic factor (Type 2 feature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   Glycation of proteins (measured by hemoglobin A1C) leads to inflammation (Type 1 feature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
This subtype is highly common, with research suggesting a signature of [[Alzheimers Disease and Insulin Sensitivity | insulin resistance]] in the nervous system of nearly all evaluated individuals with [[Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]], even if not evident peripherally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.

### Type 3: Toxic or "Vile" Alzheimer's Disease

This subtype is a response to specific toxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Metalotoxins:** Such as mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.
*   **Organic toxins:** Like DDE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.
*   **Biotoxins:** Produced by mold species (e.g., trycothesinson, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin, gliotoxin from *Stachybotrys*, *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. Chronic exposure to mold in leaky buildings is a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.

Individuals with Type 3 AD often exhibit:
*   **Low serum zinc** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> and **high copper-zinc ratios** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Zinc deficiency is common globally and can be exacerbated by poor gastric acidity, PPIs, or copper piping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. High copper-zinc ratios have been linked to dementia for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Low triglycerides** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Younger age of onset**, often in their late 40s or mid-50s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   Often **women** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   Frequently **[[ApoE4 | ApoE4]] negative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Non-amnestic presentation**, focusing on executive dysfunction, calculation problems, visual perception issues, or word-finding difficulties (primary progressive aphasia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. These are often bi-parietal or cortical presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. However, [[ApoE4 | ApoE4]] homozygotes with Type 3 AD may still have an amnestic presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Type 4: Vascular Component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>

This subtype involves a significant vascular component, contributing to the overall neurodegeneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Type 5: Traumatic Component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>

This subtype is associated with a history of head trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

While all these subtypes are characterized by amyloid plaques and tau tangles, their clinical presentations can differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Type 1, 1.5, and 2 typically present with amnestic (memory-related) issues, especially common with [[ApoE4 | ApoE4]] positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Type 3, the toxic form, often presents non-amnestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Tailoring Treatment based on Subtypes

Understanding these subtypes is crucial for an effective [[multipronged_protocol_for_alzheimers | multi-pronged protocol]] for [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | reversing Alzheimer's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The ReCODE protocol (Reversal of Cognitive Decline) emphasizes identifying and addressing all contributing factors for each individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

Biomarkers measured to identify subtypes include:
*   **hsCRP** (marker of inflammation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>
*   **Homocysteine** (marker of methylation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a> â€“ high levels are associated with more rapid decline in cerebral grey matter and hippocampal volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Optimal homocysteine is less than 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Fasting insulin** (optimally less than 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>
*   **Hemoglobin A1C** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>
*   **Fasting glucose** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>
*   **Vitamin D** (optimal levels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>
*   Hormone levels: pregnenolone, progesterone, estradiol, testosterone, free T3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>
*   Assessment of toxin exposure, especially mycotoxins (e.g., using EPA Relative Mold Index (ERMI) home testing via mycometrics.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a> and urinary mycotoxin tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
*   Gut health markers (e.g., Genova GI effects test, Cyrex arrays 2 and 3 for antibodies to LPS or gluten/gliadin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>.

While Type 1 and 1.5 (inflammatory and glycotoxic) are common, most individuals present with a mixture of subtypes, often including some degree of Type 3 (toxic) exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>. Type 1 and 1.5 are considered easier to address through diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. Improving atrophic components (Type 2) requires optimizing trophic support and potentially bio-identical hormone replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>. Type 3 is often the most challenging due to the need to identify and remove ongoing toxin exposures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.

This personalized approach contrasts with failed monotherapeutic trials targeting amyloid, as amyloid is a mediator and protectant, not the sole cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. Removing amyloid without addressing its underlying causes can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>. [[Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] should become a rare disease if individuals get checked and follow an optimal personalized program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

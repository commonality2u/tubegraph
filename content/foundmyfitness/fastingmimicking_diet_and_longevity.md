Dr. Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology and Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California and Director of the Longevity Institute, has made significant contributions to the field of aging, particularly concerning the effects of [[Fasting and caloric restriction mimetics | fasting]] and other diets on human aging, lifespan, and biomarkers of healthspan [00:00:09]. His research also explores metabolic [[Fasting and cancer therapy | fasting therapies]] for human diseases [00:00:24].

## What is the Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD)?

The [[fastingmimicking diet development | Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD)]] is a specific dietary approach designed to "trick the system" into believing it is undergoing a prolonged fast, even while consuming a limited amount of food [00:01:23]. It typically involves a diet that is low in protein, low in sugar, and high in beneficial fats [00:02:28].

This approach differs significantly from traditional caloric restriction, which involves a permanent, moderate reduction in calorie intake [00:03:04]. While caloric restriction involves continuous eating with fewer calories, [[Fasting and caloric restriction mimetics | periodic fasting]] and [[fastingmimicking diet development | FMD]] are more extreme interventions designed to orchestrate specific genetic responses [00:03:16].

A crucial distinction of the FMD from continuous [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] is the importance of the refeeding period [00:03:54]. Most people associate benefits with the restriction phase, but research indicates that refeeding is responsible for much of the observed positive effects, such as the rebuilding of systems after stem cell activation during fasting [00:04:02].

## Development and Rationale

The idea for the [[fastingmimicking diet development | Fasting-Mimicking Diet]] arose from a desire to find an intervention that could replicate the powerful benefits of [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] in a way that is safe and feasible for everyone [00:02:07]. Dr. Longo was a student of Roy Walford, a pioneer in calorie restriction research, and observed the challenges and stress associated with permanent calorie restriction during the Biosphere 2 human study [00:01:40]. The FMD was conceived as a way to achieve similar effects without the need for permanent, severe dietary changes, making it more compliant for patients and doctors [00:15:09].

## Mechanisms and Health Impacts

### Stem Cell Regeneration and Immune System Rejuvenation

Dr. Longo's research, primarily in animals, shows that prolonged [[Fasting and stem cell regeneration | fasting]] (e.g., 48 to 72 hours in animals) leads to a decrease in white blood cell populations [00:04:42]. This reduction is largely due to apoptosis, a programmed cell death, rather than solely autophagy (clearing away damaged cells) [00:05:48]. For instance, approximately 40% of white blood cells in mice are destroyed during a four-day fast [01:06:01].

The critical phase for regeneration occurs during refeeding. After the reduction in white blood cells, the system rebuilds itself within a few days of refeeding, leading to the generation of new, functional cells [00:06:10]. This is described as a powerful regeneration program, akin to the systems generated during birth, which allows organs like the liver and the immune system to shrink and then regenerate [00:06:14].

This process has significant implications for [[Impact of fasting on immune system and aging | human aging]], particularly regarding immunosenescence, the age-related decline in immune function [00:07:19]. In older mice, [[Fasting and stem cell regeneration | fasting]] was found to restore lymphocyte numbers to more youthful levels and shift the myeloid-to-lymphoid cell ratio towards a younger profile, effectively "rejuvenating" the immune system [00:08:41].

### Inflammation Reduction

[[Fasting and caloric restriction mimetics | FMD]] has been shown to reduce markers of inflammation [00:13:08]. In mice given the FMD starting at middle age, a decrease in inflammation was observed [00:13:13]. Similarly, in a human population aged 20 to 70, individuals with high C-reactive protein levels saw them return to normal after three cycles of FMD [00:13:21]. This reduction in inflammation is believed to indicate that the body's systems are being reset to a more youthful state [00:14:19].

### Metabolic Shift

The [[fastingmimicking diet development | Fasting-Mimicking Diet]] induces a metabolic shift in the body [00:40:20]. By day two of the diet, the system typically switches to a ketogenic mode, where the body starts burning visceral fat as its primary energy source [00:40:27]. The brain also shifts from using sugar to burning ketone bodies, such as beta-hydroxybutyrate [00:40:34]. This metabolic state contributes to the observed shrinking and subsequent rebuilding of various organs and systems, including the immune system, liver, heart, and oligodendrocytes (relevant to multiple sclerosis) [00:40:40].

## Clinical Applications

### [[Fasting and cancer therapy | Cancer Therapy]]

Dr. Longo's research shows that [[Fasting and cancer therapy | fasting]] and FMD can enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy while protecting normal cells [00:19:20]. This phenomenon is termed:
*   **Differential Stress Resistance:** Normal cells enter a protective, shielded mode when starved, making them resistant to toxins like chemotherapy [00:19:53].
*   **Differential Stress Sensitization:** Cancer cells, which are "very dumb" and adapted to high-nourishment environments, cannot enter this protected mode due to their oncogene regulation [00:20:34]. When starved, they become vulnerable and undergo suicide, especially when combined with chemotherapy [00:23:00]. This is partly due to the "fasting-dependent anti-Warburg effect," where lower glucose levels force cancer cells to rely on oxidative phosphorylation, leading to the production of damaging free radicals [00:29:43].

Combining starvation or [[Fasting and cancer therapy | FMD]] with chemotherapy has led to cancer-free survival in mice, a result rarely achieved with either intervention alone [00:23:16]. This highlights the importance of an integrated approach combining traditional medicine with scientifically founded alternative or integrative medicine [00:24:05].

The FMD may also contribute to the immune system's ability to fight cancer by making cancer cells more "immunogenic" and recognizable by immune cells, such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes [00:31:18].

### Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

Clinical studies in both mice and humans have explored the effects of FMD and ketogenic diets on multiple sclerosis [00:41:14]. In mice, the FMD destroyed old immune cells, turned on stem cells, and led to the generation of new, non-autoimmune cells [00:42:25]. This resulted in about 20% of mice being cured of autoimmunity similar to MS [00:42:52]. The FMD also reduced inflammation around the spinal cord, allowing progenitor cells to rebuild myelin and regenerate the spinal cord [00:43:13].

In human trials, a single week of [[fastingmimicking diet development | FMD]], followed by a regular Mediterranean diet for six months, showed better outcomes than six months of a continuous ketogenic diet for MS patients, highlighting the power of periodic intervention [00:45:05].

### Other Diseases

Dr. Longo's work suggests that FMD has potential applications for a wide range of diseases due to its ability to eliminate damaged cells and promote the regeneration of fully functional ones [00:46:15]. Studies are ongoing in various autoimmune diseases, cognitive diseases, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [00:46:21].

## Comparison with Other Interventions

### [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | Caloric Restriction]] and [[Intermittent fasting | Time-Restricted Eating]]

While [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | caloric restriction]] involves a constant reduction in calories, [[Fasting and caloric restriction mimetics | fasting]] and [[fastingmimicking diet development | FMD]] are more extreme and intermittent [00:03:04]. The crucial difference lies in the refeeding phase, which is absent in continuous caloric restriction and is vital for regeneration [00:03:54].

[[Intermittent fasting | Time-restricted eating]], such as eating within a 12-hour window, aligns with circadian rhythms and is important for metabolic factors [00:00:36]. Dr. Longo recommends incorporating this into daily habits, suggesting two meals a day for weight control and visceral fat reduction, while emphasizing flexibility based on individual needs [00:33:12]. However, a daily 14-hour fast, while beneficial, may not achieve the same profound shrinking and rebuilding effects as a prolonged FMD, as glycogen stores prevent a full metabolic switch to fat burning and deep regeneration [00:39:52].

### [[Fasting and caloric restriction mimetics | Fasting-Mimicking Drugs]]

Certain compounds like resveratrol and spermidine are considered [[Fasting and caloric restriction mimetics | fasting-mimicking drugs]] because they activate signaling pathways similar to those engaged during fasting [00:58:39]. While they may offer some benefits, they generally have weaker effects and potential side effects compared to the physiological response induced by actual fasting or FMD [00:59:06]. Metformin is also noted for activating AMP kinase, similar to fasting, but its long-term effects on healthy individuals are still under evaluation [01:02:08].

### Exercise

Exercise is highly beneficial for overall health and [[diet and lifestyle impact on longevity | longevity]] [01:11:40]. It can cause muscle damage and subsequent repair, leading to muscle building [01:11:50]. This continuous process of small regenerative events, especially weight training, can cumulatively be very powerful [01:12:12]. [[Fasting and caloric restriction mimetics | FMD]] specifically targets visceral fat loss while preserving or rebuilding lean muscle mass, distinguishing it from other diets that might lead to general loss of water, muscle, and fat [01:13:11].

## Future and Accessibility

Dr. Longo envisions that periodic [[fastingmimicking diet development | FMD]] interventions could become standard in doctor's offices worldwide within 10 years [01:17:31]. The FMD approach, provided in a pre-packaged box of foods, has significantly increased patient compliance and doctor acceptance compared to traditional fasting [00:15:38].

The [[fastingmimicking diet development | ProLon FMD]] product is available through L-Nutra (l-nutra.com) [01:15:05]. It requires medical clearance from a doctor due to its powerful effects, especially for individuals with existing diseases or those taking medication [01:16:45].

Dr. Longo emphasizes a flexible approach to [[diet and lifestyle impact on longevity | nutrition]] and [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]], advocating for two meals a day for those prone to weight gain and three meals for those who are underweight, with the overall feeding window kept at 12 hours or less [00:33:12]. He believes that sustainable interventions that people can adhere to long-term are more effective than overly restrictive plans [00:37:35].

Dr. Valter Longo, a professor of Gerontology and Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California and Director of the Longevity Institute, has made significant contributions to the field of [[impact_of_diet_on_longevity_and_healthspan | aging]], particularly regarding the effects of [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | fasting]] and other [[Dietary interventions in longevity | diets]] on human [[impact_of_diet_on_longevity and healthspan | aging]] and healthspan biomarkers, as well as metabolic [[Fasting as a treatment for cancer and multiple sclerosis | fasting therapies]] for human diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Origin and Development of [[Fastingmimicking diets | Fasting-Mimicking Diets]]

Dr. Longo's research is highly interested in interventions that safely extend longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. His focus is on periodic [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | fasting]], or more specifically, [[Fastingmimicking diets | fasting-mimicking diets]] (FMD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These [[Fastingmimicking diets | diets]] are designed to "trick the system" into thinking it's [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | fasting]] when a person is still consuming food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The concept emerged as an alternative to [[calorie_restriction_and_intermittent_fasting | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Dr. Longo, a former student of [[calorie_restriction_and_intermittent_fasting | calorie restriction]] pioneer Roy Walford, observed the highly stressed and thin state of participants in the Biosphere 2 [[calorie_restriction_and_intermittent_fasting | calorie restriction]] study in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This experience motivated him to develop a powerful, yet universally accessible, intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The [[Fastingmimicking diets | fasting-mimicking diet]] typically involves a period of four days to one week or longer, with a diet that is low in protein, low in sugar, and high in beneficial fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## How [[Fastingmimicking diets | Fasting-Mimicking Diets]] Work

### Distinction from [[calorie_restriction_and_intermittent_fasting | Calorie Restriction]]
[[Fastingmimicking diets | Fasting]] and periodic [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | fasting]] are distinct from [[calorie_restriction_and_intermittent_fasting | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. While [[calorie_restriction_and_intermittent_fasting | calorie restriction]] involves a continuous 20% to 30% reduction in caloric intake, [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | fasting]] interventions are more extreme and are designed to orchestrate gene expression to increase protection and activate stem cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### The Critical Role of Refeeding
A key difference is the importance of refeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While most people associate benefits with the restriction period, Dr. Longo's research shows that refeeding drives much of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. For example, stem cells are activated during [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_im pacts | fasting]], but the refeeding period causes the rebuilding of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This coordinated effect based on cycles of [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | fasting]] and refeeding is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Cellular Regeneration and Immune System Rejuvenation
Prolonged [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | fasting]] (e.g., 48 to 72 hours in animals) leads to a decrease in white blood cell populations due to programmed cell death (apoptosis), not primarily autophagy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This "killing" of unnecessary cells is a survival mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. In mice, about 40% of white blood cells are destroyed during a four-day fast, and this 40% is rebuilt within days of refeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This process represents one of the most powerful regeneration programs since birth, leading to the shrinking and subsequent regeneration of organs like the liver and immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

These findings have implications for human [[impact_of_diet_on_longevity and healthspan | aging]], particularly for immunosenescence, the age-related decline of the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Studies in older mice showed that [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | fasting]] brought lymphocyte numbers back to a more youthful level, and the myeloid cell to lymphocyte ratio moved towards a younger profile, indicating a "rejuvenation of the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Therapeutic Applications

### [[Fasting as a treatment for cancer and multiple sclerosis | Fasting as a Treatment for Cancer]]
[[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | Fasting]] or [[Fastingmimicking diets | FMD]] can induce "differential stress resistance" and "differential stress sensitization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Differential Stress Resistance**: Normal cells, when starved, enter a protected "shielding mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. In this mode, they become very resistant to various toxins, including chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Cancer cells, however, cannot enter this protected mode due to their oncogenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
*   **Differential Stress Sensitization**: Cancer cells are "dumb" and adapted to an environment of nutrient abundance (proteins, amino acids, sugars, growth factors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. When these nutrients are removed through [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | fasting]], cancer cells become "miserable" and starve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

Dr. Longo's lab discovered the "fasting-dependent anti-Warburg effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. Cancer cells, normally reliant on glucose (Warburg effect), are forced to switch to oxidative phosphorylation using mitochondria when glucose is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. This desperate state causes them to produce high levels of free radicals, leading to suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. This also makes cancer cells more immunogenic, allowing immune cells to recognize and kill them more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

In mice, cancer-free survival is observed primarily when [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | fasting]] or [[Fastingmimicking diets | FMD]] is combined with chemotherapy, not with either intervention alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. This highlights the power of combining traditional and scientifically-backed integrative approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

### [[Fasting as a treatment for cancer and multiple sclerosis | Fasting as a Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis]] (MS)
Research in both mice and humans has explored [[Fastingmimicking diets | FMD]] and ketogenic diets for MS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>.
*   The [[Fastingmimicking diets | FMD]] causes partial destruction of autoimmune white blood cells, then activates stem cells to produce new, non-autoimmune cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
*   It also reduces general inflammation, particularly around the spinal cord, enabling progenitor cells to regenerate new myelin and rebuild the spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   In a clinical study, one week of [[Fastingmimicking diets | FMD]] followed by a Mediterranean diet performed better than six months of a continuous ketogenic diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

## Practical Implementation and Philosophy

### FMD vs. Daily [[Intermittent fasting and its effects on aging pathways | Time-Restricted Eating]]
While daily [[Intermittent fasting and its effects on aging pathways | time-restricted eating]] (e.g., a 12-hour eating window as championed by Dr. Satchin Panda) is beneficial for metabolic factors aligned with circadian rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>, [[Fastingmimicking diets | FMD]] induces a deeper metabolic shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. After about two days on the [[Fastingmimicking diets | FMD]], the body enters a ketogenic mode, burning visceral fat for energy and the brain shifts to using ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>. This leads to the "shrinking" and rebuilding of various organs and systems that typically don't occur with shorter, daily fasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

### Accessibility and Compliance
The [[Fastingmimicking diets | fasting-mimicking diet]] was designed to be more compliant than traditional prolonged fasts. It is provided in a "box" format, making it feel more like a medicine and easier for patients and doctors to adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This has led to its recommendation by cardiologists, endocrinologists, and gynecologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Dr. Longo envisions these types of interventions becoming standard in medical practice worldwide within 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

The philosophy emphasizes flexibility and aligning with people's lifestyles to ensure long-term adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. For example, a two-meal-a-day program is suggested for those needing weight control, while three meals are appropriate for underweight individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

### ProLon FMD
The ProLon FMD product, developed by L-Nutra (l-nutra.com or fmd.com), is currently being tested clinically and prescribed by doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. It's designed for use at home with professional guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.

### Cautions
[[Fastingmimicking diets | Fasting-mimicking diets]] are powerful interventions and require caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. Individuals with diabetes, anorexia, or other diseases, especially those on medications, must consult a doctor for clearance and to ensure safe combination with the FMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>.

## Broader Implications for [[Impact of diet on longevity and healthspan | Longevity]]

### Inflammation and [[Impact of diet on longevity and healthspan | Aging]]
While inflammation is a significant marker of [[impact of diet on longevity and healthspan | aging]] and a predictor of mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>, Dr. Longo views [[impact of diet on longevity and healthspan | aging]] as the cause of inflammation, rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. The FMD has been shown to decrease inflammation markers like C-reactive protein in both mice and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.

### Growth Hormone and IGF-1 Pathways
[[Macronutrients and Longevity | Protein]] and amino acids control two major pro-[[impact of diet on longevity and healthspan | aging]] pathways: the growth hormone IGF-1 axis and the tyrosine kinase pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. Lowering activity in these pathways, either through diet or genetic mutations, is associated with extended lifespan and reduced disease in mice and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>. The cycle of [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | fasting]] (which lowers IGF-1) and refeeding (which raises IGF-1) is crucial for the regenerative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.

### Exercise as a Complementary Intervention
Exercise, especially weight training, is vital to prevent loss of lean body mass during dietary restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. It creates muscle damage followed by repair, contributing to muscle building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. [[intermittent_fasting_and_its_health_impacts | Fasting]] itself causes a temporary loss of muscle but then rebuilds it, leading to a specific loss of visceral fat with minimal lean body mass loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. Exercise also helps direct IGF-1 to muscles and the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.

### Future Research
Current research is exploring the role of mitophagy (clearing damaged mitochondria) in the effects of [[Fastingmimicking diets | FMD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:09">[01:14:09]</a>. The focus remains on understanding mechanisms sufficiently to implement clinical trials that address immediate patient needs, rather than a purely sequential research approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.

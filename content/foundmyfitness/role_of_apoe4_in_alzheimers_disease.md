Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the most important [[the_genetic_role_of_apoe_e4_in_alzheimers_disease | genetic risk factor]] for [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Everyone possesses two copies of the ApoE gene, with common variants being ApoE2, ApoE3, or ApoE4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. ApoE3 is the most common variant in the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Prevalence and Risk

*   **ApoE3,3 (Zero copies of ApoE4)**: Approximately 75% of the population are ApoE4 negative. Their lifetime risk for [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] is about 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **ApoE3,4 (One copy of ApoE4)**: About a quarter of the American population (approximately 75 million people) have one copy of ApoE4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Their lifetime risk for [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] is about 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **ApoE4,4 (Two copies of ApoE4)**: Around seven million Americans have two copies, making them homozygous for ApoE4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Their lifetime risk is over 50%, with some studies indicating it could be as high as 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

Historically, people were advised not to check their ApoE status due to a lack of actionable interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. However, this has "completely changed" with the development of personalized programs that can significantly reduce the risk of [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. It is now suggested that everyone aged 45 or over should undergo a "cognoscopy" to assess their risk factors, including ApoE4 status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Evolutionary Context

ApoE4 is considered the primordial variant, having been present for approximately 96% of hominid evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Chimpanzees, for example, do not possess ApoE4, but hominids do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

## Physiological Role and Implications

ApoE4 provides an advantage by conferring a "hair trigger" for [[effect_of_inflammation_and_insulin_resistance_on_alzheimers | inflammation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This heightened inflammatory response would have been beneficial in ancestral environments characterized by squalor and parasitic exposure, such as those of the Tsimane or Agana tribes studied by Professor Tuck Finch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. In such pro-inflammatory situations, ApoE4 would have aided in fighting off infections and responding to injuries like stepping on a nail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.

However, in modern, less parasitic environments, this chronic inflammatory propensity becomes counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. This phenomenon is known as "antagonistic pleiotropy," where a gene helpful in youth can increase the risk for diseases that shorten lifespan later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. ApoE4 is associated with an increased risk of [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] and cerebrovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. It is also underrepresented in centenarians, indicating it acts as a "short-gevity gene" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. Understanding the mechanisms driven by ApoE4 can help mitigate these risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

## Impact on Alzheimer's Disease Presentation

ApoE4 status can influence the presentation of [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] subtypes:
*   **Amnestic Presentations**: ApoE4 is more commonly associated with amnestic (memory-loss prominent) presentations, typical of Type 1 (inflammatory) and Type 2 (atrophic) [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]], as well as Type 1.5 (glycotoxic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.
*   **Non-Amnestic Presentations**: Type 3 (toxic) [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] often presents non-amnesticly (e.g., executive dysfunction, visual perception issues, word-finding difficulties), especially in ApoE4 negative individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. However, ApoE4 homozygotes (E4,4) with Type 3 [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] typically present with an amnestic profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. These non-amnestic presentations are sometimes called cortical presentations, often noted in younger [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's]] cases and in ApoE4 negative individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Dietary Considerations for ApoE4 Carriers

For individuals with ApoE4, specific [[dietary_and_lifestyle_interventions_for_alzheimers_prevention | dietary and lifestyle interventions for Alzheimers prevention]] are recommended within the Ketoflex 12/3 protocol:
*   **Fasting Window**: ApoE4 positive individuals are better fat absorbers and should aim for a longer overnight fast of 14 to 16 hours, compared to 12-14 hours for ApoE4 negative individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   **Fat Intake**: Initially, to induce mild ketosis, the use of Medium-Chain Triglyceride (MCT) oil or coconut oil may be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. After a month or two of establishing [[alzheimers_disease_and_insulin_resistance | insulin resistance]] and metabolic flexibility, ApoE4 carriers are advised to transition towards more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>. This adjustment helps balance cognitive benefits with [[role_of_apob_and_ldl_in_heart_disease | cardiovascular health]], by monitoring [[role_of_apob_and_ldl_in_heart_disease | LDL particle number]] (aiming for below 1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.
*   **Omega-3 Supplementation**: While fish consumption appears protective against [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] in ApoE4 carriers, DHA supplementation alone might not offer the same benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. This could be due to fish providing a broader spectrum of protective compounds, including antioxidants, or potential [[bloodbrain_barrier_and_its_role_in_cognitive_decline | blood-brain barrier]] transport defects for DHA in ApoE4 individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>.

## Prognosis and Intervention

The understanding of ApoE4's role means that [[alzheimers_disease_and_its_pathological_features | Alzheimer's disease]] should become a rare condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. With proper [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | biomarkers for cognitive decline and Alzheimers risk]] and personalized interventions, individuals who are ApoE4 positive can significantly reduce their risk and potentially prevent the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.

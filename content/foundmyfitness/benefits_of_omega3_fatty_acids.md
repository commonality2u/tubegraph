[[importance_of_omega3_fatty_acids_for_health | Omega-3 fatty acids]], specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are crucial for human physiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. These are essential fatty acids, meaning the body cannot produce them and they must be obtained through diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Data from the National Center of Health Statistics indicates that [[importance_of_omega3_fatty_acids_for_health | omega-3 fatty acids]] are among the top dietary factors influencing early mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Established Benefits of Omega-3 Supplementation

Supplementation with EPA and DHA has been shown to offer several significant health advantages:
*   **Reduced Mortality** Supplementation lowers all-cause mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Anti-Aging** It slows the attrition of telomeres, which are biological markers for aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **[[omega3_fatty_acids_and_brain_health | Brain Health]]** [[omega3_fatty_acids_and_brain_health | Omega-3s]] delay [[omega3_fatty_acids_and_brain_health | brain aging]] by assisting the brain in repairing damage and delaying brain atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Anti-Inflammatory Effects** They lower inflammation, which contributes to tissue damage and plays a role in cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Cardiovascular Health** Supplementation increases HDL (good cholesterol) and lowers triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Cellular Function** They play a vital role in cell membrane fluidity, which is crucial for neurons because the proper function of neurotransmitters (like norepinephrine, involved in focus and attention) depends on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Bioavailability of Omega-3 Forms

The [[bioavailability_of_omega3_forms | bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids]] is significantly influenced by their chemical form and how they are absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Forms of Omega-3s in Supplements
*   **Ethyl Ester Form** Fish oil is often modified by molecular distillation to concentrate EPA and DHA and remove contaminants like mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This process converts omega-3s from a triglyceride form (3 fatty acids bound to a glycerol backbone) into an ethyl ester form (glycerol backbone replaced with an ethanol backbone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Most fish oil supplements on the market contain omega-3s in this less bioavailable ethyl ester form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Ethyl esters are poor substrates for pancreatic lipase and are not absorbed well in the small intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Triglyceride Form** Omega-3 fatty acids can be re-esterified back into their triglyceride form after distillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. While more bioavailable than ethyl esters, they are still less bioavailable than the phospholipid form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Gastric lipases in the stomach can break down fatty acids in triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. For absorption, EPA and DHA from fish oil (both triglyceride and ethyl ester forms) must first be cleaved by pancreatic lipase into their free fatty acid form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Phospholipid Form** [[bioavailability_of_omega3_forms | Omega-3 fatty acids]] in krill oil are primarily found in phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. These are more bioavailable than omega-3s in triglyceride form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Phospholipids can be cleaved by phospholipases, but importantly, they can also form micelles and be absorbed in their intact form, bypassing the need for breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Evidence of Higher Bioavailability in Krill Oil
Studies demonstrate that [[bioavailability_of_omega3_forms | omega-3 fatty acids]] from krill oil in phospholipid form are more bioavailable than fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   Mice given identical doses of EPA and DHA showed the highest plasma concentrations from those in phospholipid form, followed by triglyceride, and then ethyl ester forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   Humans given krill oil at a 38% lower dose than fish oil achieved the same plasma levels of EPA and DHA as those given fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Benefits of Krill Oil for Brain Health

While plasma cholesterol concentrations of EPA and DHA are not always indicative of levels in other cell types, krill oil offers specific advantages for the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### DHA Transport to the Brain
DHA is the most abundant fatty acid in the brain, making up 10-20% of its total lipid composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **DHA-lyso-phosphatidylcholine** This is the preferred source of DHA by the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. It is a byproduct of DHA in phosphatidylcholine after cleavage by lipases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Krill Oil as a Source** Since krill oil is a rich source of phosphatidylcholine, it is also a good source of DHA-lyso-phosphatidylcholine, unlike fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Transport Mechanism** A Nature paper published in May 2014 identified a specialized DHA transporter called MFSD2A, which transports DHA-lyso-phosphatidylcholine across the blood-brain barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Mice engineered to lack this transporter had 60% less DHA in their brains compared to control mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Red Blood Cells** Red blood cells also prefer DHA-lyso-phosphatidylcholine over DHA in free fatty acid form, which is relevant as DHA concentration in red blood cells correlates tightly with actual DHA levels in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Unique Antioxidant in Krill Oil: Astaxanthin

Krill oil contains astaxanthin, a carotenoid not found in fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Antioxidant Properties** Astaxanthin sequesters singlet oxygen (produced by UV radiation) and is a potent antioxidant against peroxy radicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Both singlet oxygen and peroxy radicals damage DNA, lipids, and proteins, contributing to diseases of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Cellular Protection** Astaxanthin is easily absorbed by the bloodstream and has an amphipathic structure (both fat and water-soluble portions), allowing it to accumulate in cell membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This is beneficial because DHA, which is prone to oxidation, also accumulates in cell membranes where it contributes to cell membrane fluidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Unlike other antioxidants like glutathione, which are produced in the soluble portion of the cell and do not accumulate in cell membranes, astaxanthin can protect DHA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids from oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Independent Benefits** Astaxanthin supplementation has been shown in clinical trials to lower inflammation, decrease DNA damage (including oxidation), and increase HDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. These mechanisms are relevant to degenerative diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Other Phospholipids in Krill Oil

Krill oil is also a significant source of other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   These phospholipids accumulate in mitochondrial membranes and cell membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Their concentration in cell and mitochondrial membranes has been shown to decrease with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   A decrease in their concentration has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

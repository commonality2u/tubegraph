Aging, as defined by Aubrey de Grey, is a side effect of being alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It is a consequence of the inevitable accumulation of various molecular and cellular changes, referred to as "damage," within the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This damage is initially harmless because the body is equipped to tolerate a certain amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. However, once this damage exceeds the body's tolerance, mental and physical decline, characteristic of age-related diseases and disabilities, begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The SENS Research Foundation, founded by Aubrey de Grey, focuses on preventing and curing [[aging_as_a_disease | aging]] by addressing this accumulation of damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Balance of Damage and Repair
A common oversight, even among gerontologists, is the understanding of why the balance between damage accumulation and repair shifts with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. In old age, there is both a more rapid creation of damage and a less rapid removal (repair) of damage, leading to an accelerated accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

This imbalance is primarily caused by the accumulation of damage that the body never had the genetic capability to repair, even in youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This unrepaired damage acts as the "clock of aging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. As it accumulates, it performs a dual role:
1.  **Accelerates new damage creation**: It speeds up the generation of other forms of damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
2.  **Impedes repair mechanisms**: It hinders the body's existing damage repair systems, making them less effective at fixing damage they once could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Types of Damage
The accumulated damage can manifest in various ways:
*   **DNA Damage**: Changes the function of genes, potentially affecting repair genes or those involved in damage response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Protein Aggregation**: Alters the function of proteins, leading to cellular dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **[[Epigenetics and aging | Epigenetic Changes]]**: Modifications to gene expression and function without altering the underlying DNA sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. However, many [[Epigenetics and aging | epigenetic changes]] seen in aging are considered adaptations to minimize pathogenic consequences of other changes, rather than primary drivers of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. They are coordinated responses to the cellular environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Cellular Stiffness**: Changes the physical properties and functioning of cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

These types of damage can occur intracellularly (inside cells), extracellularly (outside cells), on cell membranes, and to various biomolecules like proteins and lipids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. The body's inability to prevent or repair damage also declines with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

## Strategies for Damage Repair
The SENS Research Foundation aims to develop a "panel of interventions" to periodically repair these various types of damage, keeping the overall abundance of damage in the body below the threshold where it becomes harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This approach focuses on repairing existing damage, rather than merely slowing down its accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

### Genetic Technologies
New technologies like CRISPR and pluripotent stem cells are significantly advancing research in damage repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

#### CRISPR
CRISPR is a crucial advance because many damage repair strategies involve genetic modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. While some modifications can be done *ex vivo* (on cells outside the body, then reinjected), others require *bona fide* somatic gene therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. The high site-specificity of CRISPR makes it much safer than traditional viral vectors, which struggle with unpredictable insertion points and the risk of causing cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. This allows for higher "titer" (amount of engineered DNA) to be introduced, increasing the proportion of cells modified without increasing off-target effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. Challenges remain in delivering CRISPR to specific tissues *in vivo* (inside the body) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>.

#### Pluripotent Stem Cells
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can be reprogrammed from adult cells (e.g., skin cells) to become any cell type in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>, are also highly promising. Methods to induce pluripotency without viruses have been perfected, such as using messenger RNA or electroporating proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. Refinements, like using six factors instead of the original Yamanaka factors, improve reprogramming fidelity, even allowing senescent cells to be reprogrammed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. While standard iPSC methods may retain some "epigenetic memory" of the original cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>, newer techniques significantly reduce this. The goal is to reprogram a patient's own cells, then differentiate them into desired cell types and reintroduce them, avoiding immune rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

### Addressing Inflammation
[[Inflammation and inflammaging | Inflammation]] is a double-edged sword, essential for fighting infections but can exacerbate age-related damage not linked to infection, such as oxidized cholesterol accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Elite long-lived populations (centenarians) often have a weaker [[Inflammation and inflammaging | inflammatory response]], which helps them avoid age-related diseases like atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. However, a weaker [[Inflammation and inflammaging | inflammatory response]] also increases susceptibility to infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

The optimal approach is not to simply dampen [[Inflammation and inflammaging | inflammation]], but to "fix the problem of maladaptive activation" of the immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. This means targeting the "targets" of [[Inflammation and inflammaging | inflammation]] (e.g., eliminating oxidized cholesterol in atherosclerosis, or amyloid and tau in Alzheimer's) so that the inflammatory response is not inappropriately triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

### Parabiosis
Parabiosis, the linking of circulatory systems between a young and old animal, has shown exciting results in reversing some [[Cellular senescence and aging | biomarkers of aging]] in old animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. While not a therapeutic regimen itself, it is valuable for discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. It points to potential alternative interventions like plasma exchange or apheresis, which involve altering blood composition by removing or adding specific factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. Identifying the causal factors (e.g., GDF11) that lead to rejuvenation is a primary challenge in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

It is important to remember that the circulation primarily *transmits* damage, rather than creating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. Thus, identifying and rejuvenating the source cells responsible for changes in the blood (e.g., fixing the shrinking thymus to restore naive T cells) is a key strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

## Lifestyle and Nutrition
While nutrition and lifestyle play an important role in health, optimizing them has a limited impact on maximum lifespan. Improvements in diet and exercise can significantly increase health expectancy and life expectancy for those at the lower end of the spectrum (e.g., preventing morbid obesity which reduces lifespan by 14 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. However, for individuals already living a healthy lifestyle, the additional gain in life expectancy from further optimization is estimated to be only around two years, if that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

Even with optimal micronutrient intake and metabolism, the fundamental processes of breathing oxygen and metabolizing food inherently produce damage that cannot be entirely stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. Therefore, interventions focused on comprehensively repairing this accumulated damage are seen as the most promising path to address aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

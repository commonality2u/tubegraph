Rhonda Patrick, working with Bruce Ames at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, discusses how [[the_role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_aging | diet]] and [[impact_of_lifestyle_habits_on_aging and_longevity | lifestyle]] can regulate the aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Diet's Impact on Obesity and Lifespan
Obesity is increasing by 50% per decade, including childhood obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This rise is attributed to an "obesogenic diet" characterized by highly processed foods lacking essential micronutrients, vitamins, and minerals, with very few or no fruits and vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Obesity significantly increases the risk of:
*   Cardiovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   Type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Neurodegenerative disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

In extreme cases, obesity can reduce a person's lifespan by as much as 14 years compared to a lean individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Diet, DNA Damage, and Cancer Risk
Normal bodily processes, such as eating and breathing, lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during cellular respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. These ROS damage cells, including their proteins, lipids, and DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Research indicates that individuals with a BMI of 28 or above (considered obese) have significantly higher levels of double-stranded DNA breaks in their white blood cells compared to lean individuals with a BMI of 25 or below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This is partly due to increased ROS production in obese individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

DNA damage, if not properly repaired by DNA repair enzymes, can lead to mutations and eventually full-blown cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. These repair enzymes require magnesium to function properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Unfortunately, about 45% of the population does not consume adequate levels of magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Magnesium is abundant in green leafy plants like spinach and kale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This DNA damage is an insidious process, as it is not outwardly visible like a clinical symptom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. It accumulates over years, contributing to age-related diseases like cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Micronutrient Intake Solution
To ensure adequate micronutrient intake, a daily smoothie is suggested, containing:
*   Kale, chard, spinach (for magnesium, vitamin K, calcium, vitamin C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>
*   Carrots and tomato (for carotenoids, beta-carotene, pro-vitamin A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
*   Avocado (for potassium, vitamin E, tocotrienols, tocopherols) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   Banana, apple, mixed berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
*   Unsweetened almond milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>

## Diet's Transgenerational [[epigenetics_and_aging | Epigenetic]] Effects
A poor [[the_role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_aging | diet]] not only affects an individual's aging process but can also influence how their children and grandchildren age through [[epigenetics_and_aging | epigenetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. [[epigenetics_and_aging | Epigenetics]] refers to changes in gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Epigenetic marks (like methylation groups) sit on DNA and regulate which genes are turned on or off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

These epigenetic marks are regulated by:
*   [[the_role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_aging | Diet]] and micronutrient intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
*   Exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>
*   Stress levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>
*   Sleep quality and quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

These changes in gene expression can be passed down to children and grandchildren via sperm and egg DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Mouse Studies on Transgenerational Effects
*   **High-Fat Diet**: Male mice fed a high-fat, inflammatory diet (corn oil) became obese and developed type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Surprisingly, their female offspring, even when fed a normal diet and remaining lean, also developed type 2 diabetes later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This was because the father's high-fat diet altered gene expression related to insulin secretion in their sperm DNA, which was then passed on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **B-Vitamin Supplementation**: Mice with the "Agouti gene" (predisposing them to obesity, cancer, and type 2 diabetes, and giving them yellow fur) were studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Female mice with this gene were fed a diet high in B vitamins (folic acid, B12) three weeks before pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Their offspring still carried the Agouti gene, but it was silenced by an epigenetic mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. These mice did not have yellow fur and were not predisposed to cancer or type 2 diabetes, demonstrating that diet can positively influence gene expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Vitamin D and Aging
Approximately 70% of the US population has inadequate levels of vitamin D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Factors regulating the body's ability to produce vitamin D from sunlight include:
*   **Sunscreen and Skin Pigmentation**: Melanin in darker skin and sunscreen block UVB radiation, which is necessary for the skin to produce vitamin D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Body Fat**: Vitamin D is fat-soluble and stored in body fat. More body fat means less vitamin D is bioavailable for activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Age**: Aging decreases the skin's efficiency to make vitamin D; a 70-year-old produces four times less than a 20-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Latitude**: Living above 37 degrees latitude means UVB radiation doesn't hit the surface for seven months out of the year, limiting vitamin D production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Indoor Lifestyle/Sun Avoidance**: Spending most time indoors or avoiding sun exposure (e.g., due to concerns about skin aging and DNA damage from UVB) also contributes to deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

A simple blood test can determine vitamin D levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The Endocrine Society defines:
*   Deficient: < 20 ng/mL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>
*   Inadequate: < 30 ng/mL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>
*   Adequate: 30-60 ng/mL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>

Supplementation is a simple solution. While fatty fish contain vitamin D, a daily intake of 4,000 IUs (the upper tolerable intake set by the Institute of Medicine) can raise levels from deficient to adequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Vitamin D converts into a steroid hormone that regulates the expression of over a thousand different genes, influencing numerous physiological processes in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

### Vitamin D and Serotonin Production
Vitamin D increases the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. TPH2 is responsible for converting tryptophan into serotonin, a crucial neurotransmitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Serotonin regulates cognitive function and behaviors such as social behavior, emotion, aggression, anxiety, cognition, memory, and appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

During early brain development, serotonin acts as a brain morphogen, controlling the structure and wiring of the fetal brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Insufficient serotonin during this period can lead to abnormal brain structure and wiring, potentially affecting developmental outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

Serotonin also regulates executive functions like learning, memory, decision-making, pro-social behavior, and impulsivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Serotonin depletion in normal individuals has been shown to increase impulsivity and impair long-term decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

### Vitamin D and Telomere Length
Vitamin D regulates the aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. It affects telomeres, which are protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that safeguard DNA from damage and unwinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Telomere length is a biomarker for aging; shorter telomeres are associated with older biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

In twin studies, those with the highest vitamin D levels had the longest telomeres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. This difference in telomere length corresponded to a 5-year difference in biological aging, meaning cells of twins with low vitamin D appeared 5 years older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. DNA damage and [[role_of_inflammation_in_aging | inflammation]] both accelerate telomere shortening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. Vitamin D increases the expression of DNA repair genes and decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus regulating telomere length and the aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

## Impact of Caloric Restriction
Caloric restriction has a profound impact on aging. A study with Rhesus monkeys showed that a monkey fed 30% less food throughout its life appeared significantly younger than a monkey of the same chronological age that ate as much as it wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. The calorie-restricted monkey also had a lower likelihood of brain atrophy, cancer, and type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

This demonstrates that there can be a significant difference between chronological age and biological age, heavily influenced by [[diet_and_lifestyle_impact_on_longevity | diet]] and [[lifestyle_and_environmental_factors_affecting_aging | lifestyle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

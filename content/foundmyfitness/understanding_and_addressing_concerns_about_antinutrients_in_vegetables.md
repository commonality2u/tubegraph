There are common concerns about "anti-nutrients" purportedly present in raw vegetables, such as kale and spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. However, many of these concerns may create undue anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.

## Isothiocyanates

Isothiocyanates, found in vegetables like kale and other [[safety_concerns_and_misconceptions_about_cruciferous_vegetables | cruciferous vegetables]], are beneficial plant hormetic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>. They have potent anti-cancer properties by inhibiting Phase 1 biotransformation enzymes (which convert pro-carcinogens to active carcinogens) and activating Phase 2 detoxification enzymes (which decrease DNA damage and inactivate pro-carcinogens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. The discussed smoothie recipe is designed to maximize, not minimize, its isothiocyanate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>.

### Addressing Concerns
Isothiocyanates have been referred to as goitrogens because, in small amounts, they can compete for iodine transport into the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>. However, high levels of isothiocyanates from large quantities of [[safety_concerns_and_misconceptions_about_cruciferous_vegetables | cruciferous vegetables]] have not been shown to increase hypothyroidism unless accompanied by severe iodine deficiency, which is uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. Countless animal studies have shown that feeding animals large quantities of isothiocyanates does not cause hypothyroidism; instead, it inhibits cancer formation and prevents cancer initiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.

## Oxalate

Oxalate is present in higher quantities in spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>. Concerns have been raised that oxalate from spinach may increase kidney stone risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>. While boiling spinach does reduce the amount of soluble oxalate (the type absorbable by human intestines and associated with kidney stone formation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>, there are other factors to consider.

### Addressing Concerns
Both magnesium and calcium ions cause oxalate to become insoluble, meaning it cannot be absorbed by the human intestines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>. Studies have shown that both magnesium and calcium ions dramatically decrease oxalate absorption in healthy human volunteers to less than 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>. This is a primary reason for consuming raw spinach, as spinach itself is very high in magnesium and also contains calcium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>. The described smoothie, containing spinach, is very high in magnesium and calcium, which substantially reduces the amount of soluble oxalate present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

After consuming a similar version of this micronutrient-rich smoothie several days a week for over five years, no kidney or thyroid irregularities have appeared in blood work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>. This anecdotal evidence, coupled with compelling animal studies, suggests that the benefits of consuming isothiocyanates and other plant compounds far outweigh any potential theoretical risks that are not backed up by scientific literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>.

Dr. Ruth Patterson, a professor at the UCSD Department of Family Medicine and Public Health and leader of the Cancer Prevention program at Moores Cancer Center, UCSD, conducts ongoing research into the interface between metabolism and breast cancer risk and recurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Modifiable Lifestyle Factors and Breast Cancer Risk

Several [[impact_of_lifestyle_factors_on_breast_cancer_risk | lifestyle factors]] are known to increase breast cancer risk and are modifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:

*   [[obesity_and_its_connection_to_diseases_like_cancer | Obesity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   [[impact_of_exercise_on_cancer_prevention | Physical activity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   Diet quality (e.g., the Mediterranean dietary pattern) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Tobacco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>

It has been challenging to identify exact types of foods or individual nutrients that significantly reduce risk; however, broader dietary patterns show promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Mechanisms by Which Obesity Increases Breast Cancer Risk

[[obesity_and_its_connection_to_diseases_like_cancer | Obesity]] can increase breast cancer risk by up to twofold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> through several mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:

*   Increased inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   Increased estrogen hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   Increased fasting insulin levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

### Role of Estrogen

Estrogen is a known risk factor and a growth factor that increases tumor growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Fat tissue can secrete estrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Successful drugs have been developed based on blocking estrogen's action to reduce cancer risk or recurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Role of Insulin

More recently, researchers have realized that other growth factors, like insulin, have a similar impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Insulin is also a growth factor that encourages metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. High levels of circulating insulin are believed to be central to developing breast cancer and promoting its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. These high insulin levels are commonly found in overweight individuals, those who are less physically active, and diabetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Interconnection of Insulin and Estrogen

High insulin levels are associated with lower levels of serum-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which binds estrogen and prevents it from being active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Thus, insulin and estrogen pathways are related and play off each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Growth Factors and Damaged Cells

When cells are damaged, the body has mechanisms to sense this damage and initiate cell death (apoptosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. However, the presence of these growth factors (like insulin, [[mtor_and_igf1_pathways | insulin-like growth factor (IGF1)]], and estrogen) sends signals to damaged cells to continue growing and survive, rather than dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This combination of inflammation (often associated with obesity) and high levels of insulin, IGF1, and estrogen creates a detrimental environment that allows damaged cells to survive and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The data on IGF1's role is less consistent and harder to understand, with some studies finding it a risk factor and others not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The complexity of these interacting systems, with redundancies and interdependencies, makes finding cures challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Key Biomarkers of Breast Cancer Risk

Three major metabolic pathways feed into creating "fertile soil" for DNA changes to progress into invasive tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>:

1.  High fasting insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
2.  High free estrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>
3.  High inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>

Each of these markers can individually increase breast cancer risk by at least twofold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Modifying Risk through [[timerestricted_eating_and_breast_cancer_prevention | Time-Restricted Eating]]

Research indicates that these biomarkers can be modified through lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Dr. Patterson's research particularly focuses on [[timerestricted_eating_and_breast_cancer_prevention | timing of meals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Circadian Rhythm and Metabolism

Humans evolved to eat during the day and fast at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Modern lifestyles, with late-night eating, disrupt this natural pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Eating a large meal in the evening is metabolically detrimental as the body should be in a fasting, catabolic state during rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

The human body's circadian rhythm, or biological clock, regulates 10-15% of the human genome, with about 50% of these genes involved in metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Humans are most insulin sensitive upon waking in the morning, with sensitivity decreasing throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Eating the largest meal in the evening, when insulin insensitivity is highest, would increase detrimental biomarkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

The "master clock" (entrained by light) and "peripheral clocks" (in organs like the liver, pancreas) become out of sync when eating occurs late at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This desynchronization leads to metabolic dysregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

Dr. Satchin Panda's research on time-restricted eating indicates that starting the eating window with the first non-water beverage and confining all meals to a 12-hour period is crucial for metabolic health, glucose regulation, and insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### Research on Nightly Fasting and Breast Cancer Recurrence

A study involving about 2,500 breast cancer survivors analyzed their food records over seven and a half years to determine their fasting intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. The findings revealed that:

*   A nightly fast of at least 13 hours was associated with a 40% reduction in breast cancer recurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   This reduction occurred "regardless of what you eat" and controlled for [[obesity_and_its_connection_to_diseases_like_cancer | overweight]] status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   There was also a non-statistically significant trend towards a 20% reduction in mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

This pattern suggests that the fast should ideally start around 7-8 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Skipping breakfast, for example, is often a marker of eating late into the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. A long stretch of gut rest is also important, and this rest should occur at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The microbes in the gut are also on a circadian rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

### Broader Health Impacts and Feasibility

This [[timerestricted_eating_and_breast_cancer_prevention | dietary pattern]] may have positive effects on various other conditions, including:

*   Type II diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>
*   Fatty liver (NAFLD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>
*   Acid reflux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>

Pilot studies demonstrate that adopting a longer nightly fasting interval is simple and highly feasible for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. This ease of implementation fosters self-efficacy and can lead to the adoption of other healthy behaviors, like walking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. This approach offers a valuable public health intervention that could shift disease risk curves for the entire population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

### Effects on Biomarkers

*   **Hemoglobin A1C:** The most consistent effect seen is a reduction in Hemoglobin A1C, a marker of average glucose levels over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This association was found in both national surveys and breast cancer survivor samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, suggesting a strong potential to reduce diabetes risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Since Hemoglobin A1C reflects three months of blood sugar, it takes about three months to see changes from an intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   **Inflammation (CRP):** A reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP), a measure of generalized inflammation, was observed only among women whose fasting interval started early in the day (e.g., 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of *when* the fasting occurs, not just the duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

### Fasting and Repair Mechanisms

Fasting, particularly during sleep, plays a crucial role in activating repair mechanisms, including DNA repair and [[role_of_autophagy_in_fasting_and_cancer_therapy | autophagy]] (clearing away damaged cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Damaged cells secrete inflammatory mediators, so clearing them away can reduce inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. Just as muscles need a rest period to repair and strengthen after exercise, the body needs time off from the oxidative damage that occurs during eating for repair mechanisms to engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

### Independence from Weight Loss and Other Benefits

While time-restricted eating may lead to modest weight loss (e.g., ~1 kg over a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>, studies suggest that its positive effects on metabolism and health may be independent of significant weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. The primary benefit seems to come from timing food intake with the body's optimal metabolic periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

Other behavioral impacts include improved sleep quality, as eating late at night can disrupt sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. Animal studies also show improvements in spontaneous activity when on this regimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

## Genetics vs. Lifestyle in Breast Cancer

The idea that one is "doomed by genetics" for breast cancer is largely incorrect for the vast majority of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

*   Less than 5% of all breast cancers are attributed to genetic factors (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2 polymorphisms), which are considered special high-risk cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.
*   Between 65% and 75% of breast cancers result from lifestyle factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>, including:
    *   [[obesity_and_its_connection_to_diseases_like_cancer | Obesity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>
    *   Diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>
    *   [[impact_of_exercise_on_cancer_prevention | Physical activity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>
    *   Smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>
    *   Alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>

Even modest [[obesity_and_its_connection_to_diseases_like_cancer | weight loss]] (e.g., 5% of body weight) can significantly improve metabolic health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. A combination of good diet quality, mindful meal timing, regular physical activity, avoiding prolonged sedentary behavior, and good sleep is the most comprehensive approach to health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

These healthful behaviors offer a "total benefit package" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>, reducing the risk of major killers like cardiovascular disease (the number one killer of women) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>, unpleasant conditions like diabetes, and improving overall quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. Lifestyle choices affect metabolic and disease pathways in overlapping ways, offering 360-degree protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.

Importantly, time-restricted eating does not require perfection; adhering to the regimen most of the time still provides significant benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. Animal studies suggest that even practicing restricted feeding five days a week, with some flexibility on weekends, can yield similar positive effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.

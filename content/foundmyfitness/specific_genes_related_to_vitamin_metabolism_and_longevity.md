This article explores consumer-available tools to understand how individual genes interact with specific nutrients, a field known as nutrigenomics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This knowledge can help individuals tailor their diet and lifestyle to their unique genetic makeup, potentially optimizing nutrient intake and extending lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Unlocking Your Genetic Information

The first step to understanding your genetic predispositions is using a 23andMe test, which costs approximately $99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Although 23andMe no longer provides health reports directly, it still offers access to your raw genetic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This raw data can then be analyzed using a tool called Promethease, which costs $5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Promethease matches your 23andMe data to a large database of over 57,000 published single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, providing insights into disease predispositions and how micronutrients may be absorbed or bioavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Understanding Gene Polymorphisms

[[impact_of_gene_polymorphisms_on_disease_risk_and_aging | Gene polymorphisms]] are variations in the DNA sequence of a gene that can alter its function, either positively or negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Unlike mutations, which occur randomly, polymorphisms are found in a significant percentage of the population and are thought to have been selected for a reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. They can be linked to diseases like Alzheimer's or to phenotypes such as eye color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Everyone has two copies of each gene, called alleles, one from each parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Heterozygous**: If only one parent passes on a specific gene polymorphism, you are heterozygous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This may or may not have a measurable effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Homozgyous**: If both parents pass on a specific gene polymorphism, you are homozygous, which typically has a measurable effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Specific Genes and Nutrient Metabolism

### MTHFR Gene (Folate Metabolism)

The MTHFR gene (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) is associated with a cluster of polymorphisms affecting the folate metabolism pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Folate (Vitamin B9) is crucial for two main functions:
1.  **DNA synthesis**: It serves as a precursor for the DNA nucleotide thymine, essential for creating new cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
2.  **Methyl groups**: It's a precursor to methyl groups, which are vital for turning genes on or off, a process known as [[epigenetics_and_aging | epigenetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

Polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene reduce the capacity to convert 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate into 5-methylfolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This impacts the production of methyl groups and the reconversion of homocysteine into methionine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Individuals with these polymorphisms may not efficiently convert dietary folate or supplemental folic acid into 5-methylfolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, leading to higher homocysteine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Elevated homocysteine is linked to vascular diseases, including coronary artery disease, stroke, and vascular dementia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

*   Approximately 40% of the population has a 40% reduced efficiency of the MTHFR enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   About 20% has a 70% reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   Around 10% has an 80-90% reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Supplementing with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, methylcobalamin, and vitamin B12 can help circumvent these limitations and lower homocysteine levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### NPF3 Gene (Vitamin B6 Levels)

A common polymorphism in the NPF3 gene, affecting about 46% of the population, is linked to slightly lower vitamin B6 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Individuals with this polymorphism may need to increase their dietary intake of B6 or supplement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### FUT2 Gene (Vitamin B12 Absorption)

A polymorphism in the FUT2 gene impacts how vitamin B12 is absorbed in the intestines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. People with this specific [[gene_polymorphisms_and_their_effects_on_nutrient_absorption | gene polymorphism]] may need to take sublingual vitamin B12 to ensure adequate intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### BCMO1 Gene (Vitamin A Conversion)

A cluster of polymorphisms in the BCMO1 gene affects the gut's ability to convert beta-carotene (from plant sources) into retinal (provitamin A), reducing its efficiency by 30-70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Approximately 42% of the population has one polymorphism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   Around 24% has another polymorphism associated with reduced efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Individuals with these polymorphisms can increase their intake of animal products (high in active vitamin A) or supplement with the active form of vitamin A, not beta-carotene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Caution is advised as high doses of vitamin A can be toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### FADS Gene (Omega-3 Fatty Acids)

Common polymorphisms in the Delta desaturase gene (FADS) influence the body's ability to convert plant-based alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) into eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 fatty acid found in marine sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Given that this conversion efficiency is already low, polymorphisms that further decrease it can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This is particularly relevant for vegetarians who primarily rely on ALA for omega-3s; they may consider supplementing with microalgae oil, which contains EPA and DHA directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### CYP2R1 Gene (Vitamin D Metabolism)

Polymorphisms in the CYP2R1 gene, which encodes the Vitamin D 25-hydroxylase enzyme, affect the conversion of vitamin D3 into 25-hydroxy vitamin D, the main circulating form of vitamin D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. People with these polymorphisms have lower circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and reduced enzymatic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This has been linked to higher [[impact_of_vitamin_d_on_longevity_and_mortality | all-cause mortality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Studies indicate that serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D between 40 and 60 ng/mL are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality and longest telomere length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Standard supplementation of 1,000 IUs of vitamin D3 daily may not be sufficient for individuals with these [[impact_of_gene_polymorphisms_on_disease_risk_and_aging | gene polymorphisms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### PEMT Gene (Choline Synthesis)

Choline is an important precursor for making methyl groups, which regulate gene expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. While the body can synthesize choline from phosphatidylcholine, approximately 44% of women have a polymorphism in the PEMT gene that prevents them from doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This polymorphism doesn't respond to estrogen, which normally activates the PEMT gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Therefore, women with this polymorphism must increase their dietary intake of choline; egg yolk is an excellent source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Genes Related to Longevity and Disease Risk

### APOE Gene

The APOE gene has polymorphisms that create four different forms of apolipoprotein E, a lipoprotein made in the liver and brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. APOE binds to and transports cholesterol throughout the bloodstream, to tissues, and back to the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. In the brain, it transports fatty acids and cholesterol to neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
Approximately 25% of the population has a specific form called APOE4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. APOE4 is associated with higher circulating levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and a two to threefold increased risk for Alzheimer's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### FOXO3 Gene (The Longevity Gene)

The FOXO3 gene is strongly associated with [[roles_of_sirtuins_and_resveratrol_in_longevity | longevity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   Flies and worms with an equivalent (homologue) of FOXO3 show a 100% increase in lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   Mice with the FOXO3 equivalent experience a 30% increase in lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   Humans with [[impact_of_gene_polymorphisms_on_disease_risk_and_aging | polymorphisms]] associated with higher FOXO3 production have an increased chance of living to 100 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

FOXO3 promotes longevity by activating a wide range of genes that enhance resilience to stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. These include genes for:
*   Antioxidant production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>
*   DNA damage repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>
*   Killing tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>
*   Preventing protein aggregation and clumping within cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>

Knowing your [[genetic_factors_in_epigenetic_aging | genetic factors]] can be incredibly useful for tailoring diet and lifestyle to optimize nutrient intake and potentially extend lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Differences in exercise performance and physiological adaptations between men and women are primarily due to the androgenic effects of testosterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:45">[01:55:45]</a>.

## Impact of Testosterone
Testosterone plays a significant role in building muscle mass, reducing body fat, increasing blood volume, and enlarging the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:57">[01:55:57]</a>. It also influences the power output of skeletal muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:04">[01:56:04]</a>. These effects contribute to why, with equivalent access to training and coaching, men are generally faster than women in athletic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:12">[01:56:12]</a>. For example, the world records set by great female middle-distance runners during their peak careers were slower than times achieved by tens of thousands of high school boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:46">[01:56:46]</a>.

## Biological Sex and Puberty
The most significant differences between boys and girls in exercise adaptation emerge at puberty, driven by the massive increases in testosterone in males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:08">[01:58:08]</a>. Prior to puberty, there isn't a substantial difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:10">[01:58:10]</a>. While not every man will outperform every woman, given the same training and age, biological males typically run faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:21">[01:58:21]</a>.

## Cardiovascular Benefits and Disease Risk
Premenopausal women generally exhibit significant protection against [[cardiovascular_adaptations_to_exercise | cardiovascular disease]], attributed to the protective effects of estrogen and progesterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:13">[01:59:13]</a>. However, this difference can be abolished by cigarette smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:31">[01:59:31]</a>. After menopause, women's endocrinological profiles become more similar to men's, and their [[exercise_and_heart_health | cardiovascular disease]] risks accelerate, though they are often delayed by about a decade compared to men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:51">[01:59:51]</a>.

Despite a recent study suggesting women might reap similar [[cardiovascular_adaptations_to_exercise | cardiovascular benefits]] with less exercise than men, Dr. LaVine remains "underwhelmed" by this finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:06">[01:59:06]</a>. He believes the dose-response relationships for exercise adaptation are fundamentally the same for both sexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.

## Heart Structure Adaptation
In a year-long training study, women increased their heart size similarly to men in the first three months, but then plateaued, while men continued to show increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>. This difference is another example of how testosterone enhances the building of both cardiac and skeletal muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:55">[02:01:55]</a>. Despite this, researchers must include women in all studies, as they are competitive athletes and their responses to training and other challenges need to be understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:27">[02:01:27]</a>.

## Folate
Folate is an essential micronutrient found abundantly in foods like spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. It plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis and repair, being essential for the incorporation of thymine, a DNA nucleotide, into DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

When folate levels are low, DNA can misincorporate uracil (a component of RNA), leading to a type of DNA damage comparable to being irradiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Folate is also vital for regulating epigenetics, as it is a key precursor to methyl groups, which are essential for epigenetic regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

*   A typical [[Micronutrient smoothie ingredients and benefits | micronutrient smoothie]] can provide around 480 micrograms of folate, meeting the recommended daily allowance (RDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Beta-Carotene
Carrots are an excellent source of beta-carotene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Beta-carotene is a type of [[Role of carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin in eye health | carotenoid]] that possesses antioxidant activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

One of its primary functions is as a pro-vitamin A, meaning it can be converted into retinol (vitamin A) in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Vitamin A is crucial for normal immune system function and vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Approximately 34% of the U.S. population does not meet the adequate intake for vitamin A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

When the body has sufficient vitamin A, beta-carotene is no longer converted into vitamin A but instead functions as an antioxidant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

*   A [[Micronutrient smoothie ingredients and benefits | micronutrient smoothie]] can deliver approximately 54 milligrams of beta-carotene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Monounsaturated fats, such as those found in avocado, can significantly increase the dietary absorption of [[Role of carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin in eye health | carotenoids]], including beta-carotene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   The smoothie's ingredients collectively provide the RDA for vitamin A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

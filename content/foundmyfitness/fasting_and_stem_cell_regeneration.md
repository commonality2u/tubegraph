Dr. Valter Longo, a Professor of Gerontology and Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California and Director of the Longevity Institute, has significantly contributed to the field of aging, particularly through his research on the effects of fasting and other diets on human aging, lifespan, and health span biomarkers [00:00:09 | 00:00:24]. His work also explores metabolic fasting therapies for treating human diseases [00:00:24].

## Fasting and Cellular Regeneration

Dr. Longo's research, conducted in animals and humans, focuses on periodic [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] or, more specifically, [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | fasting-mimicking diets]] (FMDs). These diets are designed to "trick the system" into thinking it's fasting even when consuming some food [00:01:16 | 00:01:28]. The primary motivation for developing FMDs stemmed from the difficulty of sustaining traditional [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] permanently [00:01:31 | 00:01:40].

### Fasting vs. Calorie Restriction

[[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | Calorie restriction]] involves a continuous 20% to 30% reduction in caloric intake, meaning individuals eat less all the time [00:03:04 | 00:03:11]. In contrast, periodic [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] and [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | fasting-mimicking diets]] are more extreme interventions designed to orchestrate gene changes that promote increased protection and turn on stem cells, effects not achievable through [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] alone [00:03:16 | 00:03:40].

A crucial distinction is that [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] lacks the significant "refeeding" component that is central to the benefits of periodic [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] [00:03:44 | 00:03:57]. Dr. Longo's work has shown that while stem cells are activated *during* [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]], it is the *refeeding* period that causes the rebuilding of the system [00:04:02 | 00:04:21]. This coordinated effect, based on cycles of [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] and refeeding, is vital for the regenerative process [00:04:26 | 00:04:35].

### Stem Cell Activation and Rejuvenation

Prolonged [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]], typically 48 to 72 hours in animals, leads to a decrease in white blood cell populations [00:04:42 | 00:04:56]. This reduction is primarily due to apoptosis (programmed cell death) rather than just autophagy (clearing damaged cells), as the body eliminates unneeded cells during starvation [00:05:48 | 00:05:54]. For instance, in mice, about 40% of white blood cells are destroyed during four days of [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]], with this percentage fully rebuilt within a few days of refeeding [00:06:01 | 00:06:14].

This process represents a profound regeneration program, comparable to what occurs after birth [00:06:14 | 00:06:32]. [[different fasting methods and their effects | Fasting]] shrinks organs like the liver and the immune system, allowing for subsequent regeneration [00:06:47 | 00:06:59]. It is the body's inherent ability to reset and rebuild that makes [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] so powerful [00:07:03 | 00:07:13].

### Implications for Aging and Immune Health

The findings have significant implications for [[Impact of fasting on immune system and aging | human aging]]. As humans age, they experience immunosenescence, a decline in immune function characterized by a decrease in lymphoid cells (B and T cells) and an increase in myeloid lineage cells (neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes) [00:07:25 | 00:08:30]. Dr. Longo's studies in older mice demonstrated that [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] can revert lymphocyte numbers to more youthful levels, and the myeloid-to-lymphoid ratio shifts towards a younger profile, indicating a "rejuvenation of the system" [00:08:41 | 00:09:11]. This rebalancing of the immune system could reduce susceptibility to infections and [[Fasting and cancer therapy | cancer]] in older individuals [00:09:18 | 00:09:22].

Furthermore, the reduction in myeloid cells, which produce inflammatory chemicals like hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide, suggests a link to lower inflammation [00:10:25 | 00:11:00]. Dr. Longo views inflammation as a consequence of aging, rather than a primary driver, but acknowledges its importance as a biomarker for intervention effectiveness [00:11:35 | 00:12:01]. The [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | fasting-mimicking diet]] has been shown to decrease inflammation markers like C-reactive protein in both mice and humans aged 20-70, suggesting a "reset" of the system to a more youthful state through regeneration of bone marrow and elimination of "bad cells" in organs like the spleen and liver [00:13:08 | 00:14:25].

## Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD)

The [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | fasting-mimicking diet]] (FMD) was developed to make the benefits of [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] more accessible and safer for humans [00:14:51 | 00:15:14]. Full [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] for 48 hours or longer can be challenging and raise safety concerns, especially for patients [00:14:51 | 00:15:36]. FMD provides a structured, multi-day diet (typically 4 to 7 days) that is low in protein and sugar, and high in good fats [00:02:21 | 00:02:36]. This approach improves patient compliance and clinician comfort, as it's provided as a "medicine-like" box of foods [00:15:38 | 00:15:52].

Dr. Longo believes FMD has real potential to become standard in medical practice within 10 years, shifting the focus from drug-centered treatments to allowing the body to "fix itself" [00:17:23 | 00:17:41]. Clinical trials are underway for FMD in patients with [[Fasting and cancer therapy | cancer]], diabetes, and multiple sclerosis [00:16:19 | 00:16:31].

### Metabolic Shifts and Stem Cell Function

During FMD, the body enters a ketogenic mode by day two, burning visceral fat as a primary energy source, and the brain shifts from sugar to ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate) for fuel [00:40:20 | 00:40:40]. This metabolic shift correlates with organs like the immune system, liver, heart, and oligodendrocytes shrinking, and then regenerating [00:40:40 | 00:40:54].

The depletion of glucose during [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] forces cells, including [[Fasting and cancer therapy | cancer]] cells, to attempt oxidative phosphorylation using mitochondria, leading to increased reactive oxygen species and making them susceptible to death [00:29:57 | 00:30:25]. For stem cells, the presence of fatty acids and ketone bodies as alternative energy sources may play a role in their self-renewal and differentiation [00:49:40 | 00:50:08]. Ketone bodies, like beta-hydroxybutyrate, are also signaling molecules that can affect gene expression, potentially through mechanisms like histone deacetylase inhibition [01:00:27 | 01:00:46].

### Fasting for Autoimmune and Degenerative Diseases

The regenerative effects of [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | fasting-mimicking diets]] extend beyond aging to diseases like multiple sclerosis. In mice, FMD destroyed autoimmune white blood cells, turning on stem cells to generate new, non-autoimmune cells, leading to disease-free states in 20% of mice [00:42:25 | 00:42:57]. It also reduced inflammation around the spinal cord, allowing progenitor cells to rebuild myelin and regenerate the system [00:43:06 | 00:43:32].

In a human study for multiple sclerosis, a single 7-day cycle of FMD followed by a Mediterranean diet showed better results than six months of a continuous ketogenic diet [00:45:05 | 00:45:19]. This indicates the powerful, coordinated effect of [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] on regeneration and repair [00:43:32 | 00:43:46].

## Practical Considerations for Fasting

Dr. Longo emphasizes a flexible approach to [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]], advocating for [[different fasting methods and their effects | intermittent fasting]] (e.g., two meals a day within a 12-hour window) for weight management and overall health, and periodic [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | fasting-mimicking diets]] for deeper regenerative effects [00:32:56 | 00:33:44]. He notes that while daily [[Intermittent fasting | time-restricted eating]] can be beneficial, prolonged FMD is necessary to trigger the deeper "shrinking and rebuilding" processes, including significant stem cell activation and metabolic shifts [00:39:42 | 00:41:26].

Compliance is key, and interventions must be practical and align with people's lifestyles to be widely adopted [00:35:38 | 00:36:14]. The periodic nature of FMD (e.g., five days every three or four months) makes it less invasive and more doable for the general population [00:37:47 | 00:38:01].

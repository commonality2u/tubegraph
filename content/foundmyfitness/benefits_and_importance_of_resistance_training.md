[[resistance_training_techniques | Resistance training]] is considered an indispensable form of exercise due to its wide-ranging benefits for overall health and well-being, extending beyond those provided by cardiovascular exercise alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, a professor at Lehman College and an expert in muscle adaptations to strength training, emphasizes its fundamental role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Key Benefits of Resistance Training

### Muscle Mass and Strength
[[the_role_of_resistance_exercise_in_building_muscle_mass_and_strength | Resistance training]] is crucial for building and preserving muscle mass and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. It is particularly important for body composition. When combined with an energy deficit from nutritional restriction, it helps promote weight loss while preserving muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>. Without lifting weights, even with cardio, 25% to 30% of weight loss can come from muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. Resistance training not only staves off the loss of fat-free mass but can also lead to body recomposition (gaining muscle while losing fat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>. This is easier for those with more weight to lose and for novice trainees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. Maximizing muscle mass, however, generally requires being at maintenance calories or in a small surplus, which typically involves some fat gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>.

### Bone Density
Resistance training is the primary way to strengthen bones, with muscle pulling on bones to stimulate growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. This is particularly relevant for post-menopausal women, as 80% of osteoporosis cases are in women due to naturally lower bone mass and the osteoprotective effects of estrogen diminishing after menopause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Weight-bearing exercises are crucial for bone strengthening, with resistance training offering profound effects on staving off and even building bones, especially when started young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

### Posture
As people age and become sedentary, they lose muscle, which negatively impacts posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Aerobic training alone does not provide these benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

### Aging and Disease Prevention
[[benefits_of_exercise_for_aging_and_disease_prevention | Resistance training]] is highly beneficial for older adults. It is never too late to start, with studies showing profound improvements in muscle strength and hypertrophy in individuals aged 70 and above, even novice trainees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Starting early, particularly in teens and twenties, helps build a "bone bank" to stave off osteoporosis, especially for women, as lost bone density is very difficult to regain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.

## Training Parameters and Considerations

### Loading (Reps and Weight)
Recent literature compellingly shows that similar amounts of muscle can be gained regardless of the loading across a wide range of spectrums, from heavy loads (e.g., 8 reps) up to 30 or even 40 repetitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:16:00">[46:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:31:00">[46:31:00]</a>. This provides significant flexibility, especially for individuals training through injuries or older adults with joint issues, as lighter loads can be less uncomfortable and debilitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:04:00">[49:04:00]</a>.
However, lighter loads must be taken with a high degree of effort, meaning the last few reps are difficult to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:26:00">[49:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42:00">[49:42:00]</a>. This challenge is essential for the body to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:26:00">[50:26:00]</a>.

### Training to Failure
Training to failure (inability to perform another repetition with proper form) is not strictly necessary for hypertrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Research suggests that stopping 1-3 repetitions short of failure (RIR 1-3) can promote optimal adaptations for the general population and even shows a small benefit for strength over training to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. For bodybuilders or those very close to their genetic ceiling, incorporating some failure training on certain sets (e.g., single-joint or machine-based exercises) might be relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Volume
Volume (total sets per muscle per week) is a driver of hypertrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. For optimal hypertrophy, 10-20 sets per muscle per week is a general guideline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. However, a minimal effective dose is around four sets per muscle per week, which can yield "very nice results" for most people in 2-3 half-hour sessions per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### Time Efficiency
Strategies for time-efficient workouts include:
*   **Multi-joint exercises**: These involve multiple muscle groups and are more time-efficient (e.g., squats, rows, presses, push-ups, chin-ups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>.
*   **Supersets**: Performing two different exercises consecutively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. Paired sets (agonist/antagonist movements) or upper/lower body combinations allow for working different muscle groups without resting between sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.
*   **Drop sets**: Doing a set to failure, then immediately reducing the weight and continuing for more reps without rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. This can replace multiple traditional sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>.

### The Role of Protein Intake in Resistance Training
Protein intake is crucial for preserving and building muscle mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.
*   **Requirements**: For individuals engaged in [[effects_of_resistance_training_on_muscle_mass_hypertrophy_and_body_composition | resistance training]], roughly 1.6 to 1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day is recommended, about double the RDA for sedentary individuals (0.8 g/kg/day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:00">[24:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>. The upper safe confidence interval is about 2.2 g/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.
*   **Caloric Deficit**: Protein needs increase slightly when in a caloric deficit to prevent muscle loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>. For overweight/obese individuals, protein needs should be calculated based on their targeted lean weight, not their current higher weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00:00">[28:00:00]</a>.
*   **Protein Spacing**: Spacing protein intake across at least three relatively spaced meals (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner) can improve protein utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:35:00">[37:35:00]</a>. For older individuals, [[anabolic_resistance_and_its_relation_to_physical_activity | anabolic resistance]] to protein means higher per-dose aspects are needed, particularly leucine, an essential amino acid that kick-starts muscle growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:45:00">[30:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:27:00">[31:27:00]</a>. Animal-based proteins are rich in leucine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a>. Whole foods are preferred, but protein shakes are a convenient way to meet requirements, especially for older individuals who may have difficulty with chewing or taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:00">[31:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:00">[32:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:15:00">[32:15:00]</a>.
*   **Post-Workout Protein**: The "anabolic window" for protein intake post-workout is more like a "barn door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>. Total daily protein intake is far more important than precise timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

### Recovery
Recovery is essential to ensure sufficient energy and joint-related reserves for effective subsequent training sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:25">[01:19:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>.
*   **Importance of Blood Flow**: Being recreationally active and promoting blood flow (e.g., walking) helps optimize nutrient delivery and expedite recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>.
*   **Other Strategies**: Massage and foam rolling may help psychologically, though robust evidence is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:26">[01:25:26]</a>. Proper protein intake and Omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:03">[01:26:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>.
*   **Cold/Warm Water Immersion**: Cold water immersion (cryotherapy) can reduce soreness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a>. However, frequent cold water immersion post-training may have negative effects on hypertrophy and strength by blunting intracellular anabolic signaling, muscle protein synthesis, and circulatory response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:03">[01:28:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:47">[01:28:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. Acute inflammation from exercise appears to be positive for muscle development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Warm water baths and active recovery (e.g., walking) can also alleviate soreness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:33">[01:35:33]</a>.

### Soreness
Soreness is often due to novel stimuli, particularly the eccentric (lowering/lengthening) component of exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>. It is not necessary to be sore to make gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:22">[01:32:22]</a>. However, mild soreness might indicate that the body is being challenged beyond its present state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:55">[01:32:55]</a>. Excessive soreness is negative as it impairs subsequent training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>.

### Stretching
Stretching contributes to flexibility, but resistance training through a full range of motion can provide similar flexibility benefits to static stretching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>. Long-duration, intense stretching can also have an anabolic effect and promote muscle hypertrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:28">[01:45:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:57">[01:45:57]</a>. Inter-set loaded stretching has shown to promote greater gains in certain muscles (e.g., soleus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:31">[01:47:31]</a>. Yoga can build muscle, especially for novices, but may not optimize gains long-term as it might not sufficiently challenge muscles over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:01">[01:48:01]</a>.

### Concurrent Training
[[combination_of_resistance_training_and_aerobic_exercise | Combining resistance training with aerobic exercise]] does not necessarily blunt the anabolic effect, especially at decent volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>. If possible, it's best to space out the training (e.g., resistance training on Mon/Wed/Fri, aerobic on Tue/Thu/Sat) or perform them at different times of the day (e.g., morning/evening sessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:52">[01:38:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>. If done in the same session, resistance training should always come first to prevent aerobic training from compromising performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:23">[01:39:23]</a>. Excessive aerobic training (e.g., daily marathon running) can negatively impact muscle development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:54">[01:39:54]</a>.

### Special Populations

#### Unique Considerations for Resistance Training in Older Adults
Older individuals can make profound improvements, but recovery seems to be blunted with age, meaning they might tolerate less volume and need more recovery time between sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:48">[01:21:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>. Incorporating power training (moving weights quickly) is important for older adults to improve functional capacity and avoid falls, which can lead to serious health consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:38">[01:56:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:02">[01:57:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:16">[01:57:16]</a>. This can be done with relatively lighter weights or activities like medicine ball throws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:13">[01:59:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.

#### Women vs. Men
Women generally do not need to train differently from men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. They may recover slightly faster both inter-set and between sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

#### Children
There is compelling research showing that [[resistance_training_and_muscle_preservation | resistance training]] in youth is safe and beneficial, dispelling the myth that it stunts growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. It should be done in a supervised environment, especially for younger children (6-8 years old), and should be made fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Benefits include improved self-esteem, reduced bullying, and enhanced athletic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) Training
BFR training involves using a cuff proximally on the arms or legs while performing exercises with very light loads (20-30% 1RM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:08">[01:51:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:34">[01:51:34]</a>. It promotes similar muscle development to traditional resistance training and allows for shorter set times, potentially reducing discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:58">[01:51:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:15">[01:53:15]</a>. While generally safe, caution is advised for individuals with blood pressure issues, and it should be performed properly to avoid damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:11">[01:54:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:26">[01:54:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:35">[01:54:35]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[resistance_training_and_muscle_preservation | Resistance training]] is paramount for overall health, longevity, and quality of life. It is irreplaceable for building and preserving muscle and bone, improving body composition, and enhancing functional capacity across all ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:46">[01:49:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>.

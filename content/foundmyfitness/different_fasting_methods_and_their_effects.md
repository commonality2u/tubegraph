Dr. Valter Longo is recognized as a leading expert in how diet and lifestyle regulate longevity, particularly concerning [[intermittent fasting | fasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Limiting food intake is considered one of the most reproducible interventions shown to modulate the aging process across multiple organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Defining Fasting Modalities

There's a need to precisely define various terms related to limiting food intake, as they cover different practices with distinct effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

*   **[[Intermittent fasting | Intermittent Fasting]]**: This term can broadly include practices such as:
    *   Alternate day fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
    *   The 5:2 diet, involving two days a week of a very restricted diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
    *   One day a week of complete fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   **Time-Restricted Feeding**: Refers to restricting the daily window for eating, such as 12 hours of feeding and 12 hours of [[fasting and metabolic health | fasting]] (e.g., 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **[[Caloric restriction intermittent fasting and their biological effects | Calorie Restriction]] (CR)**: Defined as a chronic reduction of calories below the normal level, maintained continuously to keep a normal weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Periodic Prolonged Fasting / [[fastingmimicking diet development | Fasting-Mimicking Diet]] (FMD)**: This differs from [[intermittent fasting | intermittent fasting]] as it doesn't necessarily happen in frequent cycles. It involves at least two days of fasting or longer, or two days of a [[fastingmimicking diet development | fasting-mimicking diet]] or longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. It can be done once a year, or up to 20 times a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

While these interventions may share some commonalities, they are distinct and have different effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Biological Effects and Mechanisms

### Caloric Restriction Effects

Chronic [[Caloric restriction intermittent fasting and their biological effects | calorie restriction]] can have significant effects on diseases like diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

*   **Monkey Studies**: Two major studies, one from the University of Wisconsin and one from the NIH, examined the effects of CR in monkeys:
    *   The Wisconsin study, with a diet resembling a Western diet, showed increased lifespan and a significant reduction in major age-related diseases (diabetes eliminated, cardiovascular disease and cancer reduced by 50%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
    *   The NIA study, using a more ideal monkey diet, did not show an extended mean lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
    *   Both studies indicated an increase in "healthspan" (reduction in disease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   **Nutrient-Signaling Pathways**: CR, by cutting calories (and thus proteins and sugars by about 30%), is likely to affect nutrient-signaling pathways, including TOR and IGF-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
*   **Metabolism**: While some minimal shift to a ketogenic mode might occur with chronic restriction, it largely depends on the specific restriction and diet composition (e.g., high vegetable protein diet might prevent IGF-1 changes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

### Key Regulatory Pathways

Protein intake, especially certain amino acids like methionine and cysteine, regulates IGF-1 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. The IGF-1 pathway, along with insulin, growth hormone receptor-dependent signaling, TOR, and Ras, plays a crucial role in aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. PKA is also central, potentially handling both protein and sugar signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:08]</a>.

*   **IGF-1 and Longevity**: Studies on mice with growth hormone receptor or growth hormone deficiency (like those with Laron's syndrome) show they live about 40% longer and much healthier lives, protected from cancer and diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. These individuals have very low IGF-1 and insulin levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.
*   **Sugar vs. Protein**: In yeast, sugar appears to dominate over protein in regulating aging rates. Removing sugar and increasing protein intake does not have as detrimental an effect as having both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>. There's evidence in animals that low enough energy intake (especially from glucose) can allow for slightly higher essential amino acid intake without activating IGF-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.

### The Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD)

The [[fastingmimicking diet development | fasting-mimicking diet]] was developed to provide the benefits of [[Caloric restriction intermittent fasting and their biological effects | calorie restriction]] and prolonged fasting without the associated problems, especially for cancer patients who found it difficult to fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. It's designed to nourish the patient while eliciting similar effects on IGF-1, IGFBP-1, ketone bodies, and glucose as water-only fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.

#### [[Fasting and cancer therapy | FMD and Cancer]]

The initial idea for the FMD stemmed from research showing that starvation could protect normal cells while cancer cells remained sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.

*   **Mechanism**: FMD aims to regulate pathways like IGF-1, mTOR, PKA, and Ras, which are all involved in cancer growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. Ketone bodies can either hurt or accelerate cancer growth depending on the cancer type, making standalone ketogenic diets risky for cancer treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>.
*   **Combination Therapy**: FMD is considered a complementary intervention, often combined with standard cancer treatments like chemotherapy, kinase inhibitors, or immunotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>. Promising results are seen in patients with aggressive phenotypes (e.g., gliomas) combining periodic FMD with ketogenic diets and standard radiotherapy/chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a>.
*   **Clinical Trials**: Clinical trials for FMD in cancer patients are ongoing. A significant challenge is food aversion due to concurrent toxic treatments, requiring the development of varied FMD foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. Compliance has been around 40% but efforts are underway to increase it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:55:00">[27:55:00]</a>.

#### [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | FMD in Healthy Subjects]]

A randomized clinical trial involving three cycles of a five-day [[fastingmimicking diet development | fasting-mimicking diet]] once a month for three months showed remarkable results in healthy subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:07]</a>.

*   **Differential Effects**: Unlike chronic [[Caloric restriction intermittent fasting and their biological effects | calorie restriction]] that continuously drives markers down, FMD brings elevated biomarkers back to normal ranges without affecting those already within a healthy range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>.
    *   It decreased cholesterol and triglycerides in those with elevated levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:14:00">[33:14:00]</a>.
    *   It dropped IGF-1 in individuals with high levels (likely from high protein diets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>.
    *   Elevated fasting glucose levels were brought back to normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.
    *   Elevated blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) showed major improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:00">[33:34:00]</a>.
    *   Systemic inflammation (CRP) moved back to the normal range in almost all cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term Effects**: About 60% of these positive changes were still significant three months after the cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: On average, individuals might need to do FMD once every four months, but the frequency should be tailored to individual health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>. People with multiple disease risk factors (e.g., obesity, high cholesterol) may benefit from doing it once a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:00">[38:05:00]</a>.
*   **Weight Loss and Body Composition**: FMD seems to prevent the metabolic slowdown often seen in "yo-yo" diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:00">[40:11:00]</a>. It promotes metabolic flexibility, allowing the body to switch between glucose and fatty acid oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:20:00">[41:20:00]</a>. Mice studies show that FMD can speed up metabolism post-fasting, leading to weight loss even if overall monthly calorie intake remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>.
    *   FMD leads to specific abdominal fat loss, without significantly affecting subcutaneous fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:17:00">[43:17:00]</a>.
    *   Muscle mass may temporarily decrease during the fasting phase but is rebuilt during refeeding, resulting in maintained normal lean body mass and an increase in relative lean body mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:28:00">[43:28:00]</a>. This is important for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:20:00">[44:20:00]</a>.

#### Organ Shrinking and Rejuvenation

Prolonged fasting and FMD cause organs to temporarily shrink, then re-expand during refeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:00">[44:57:00]</a>. This process involves the clearing of intracellular components (autophagy) and potentially the killing of damaged cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:56:00">[45:56:00]</a>.

*   **Self-Repair Mode**: [[Impact of fasting on immune system and aging | Fasting]] may represent an evolved self-repair mode that has been lost due to constant food availability in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:34:00">[49:34:00]</a>. This "reset" mechanism could address various damaged systems, from liver damage to insulin resistance and autoimmune disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:35:00">[50:35:00]</a>.
*   **Stem Cell Activation**: Fasting activates stem cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells), which then proliferate and differentiate into healthy, new cells during the refeeding phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:04:00">[46:04:04]</a>. This process is crucial for regenerating tissues and making normal, healthy cells, as seen in mouse models for multiple sclerosis and pharmacologically induced type 1 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[48:03:00]</a>. Low IGF-1 signaling during fasting is thought to initiate stem cell self-renewal, while its increase during refeeding promotes proliferation and differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:26:00">[54:26:00]</a>.
*   **Importance of Refeeding**: The refeeding period is as important as the fasting period, as it allows for the reconstruction and rebuilding of systems that were partially broken down during fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:16:00">[47:16:00]</a>. Sufficient protein intake during refeeding is necessary to provide the "bricks" for rebuilding and to drive IGF-1 and insulin signals for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:27:00">[55:27:00]</a>.

## Biomarkers for Healthy Aging and Longevity

For assessing biological age and predicting longevity, key biomarkers include:
*   IGF-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[00:57:05]</a>
*   Insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[00:57:05]</a>
*   Glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[00:57:05]</a>
*   Systemic inflammation (CRP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[00:57:05]</a>
*   Triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:14:00">[00:57:14]</a>
*   Fatty liver (though more pathology-oriented) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:20:00">[00:57:20]</a>
*   Blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:48:00">[00:57:48]</a>

Other advanced indicators, such as methylation profiles (Steve Horvath's work), are also highly predictive of biological age and are expected to become more widely available clinically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:24:00">[00:58:24]</a>.

## "The Longevity Diet"

Dr. Longo's book, "The Longevity Diet," discusses two main aspects:

1.  **Everyday Diet**: Based on five pillars: epidemiological studies, centenarian studies, basic research focused on longevity, clinical studies, and studies of complex systems (like cars and planes, to understand how environment affects complex systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:11:00">[59:11:00]</a>. It emphasizes learning from populations with record longevity, such as centenarian groups, to gauge the safety and common use of dietary approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.
2.  **[[Fastingmimicking diet development | Fasting-Mimicking Diet]]**: This section delves into the FMD's effects on healthy people and its potential as a complementary intervention for major diseases like diabetes (type 1 and 2), autoimmune conditions, Alzheimer's and neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. It's suggested that FMD offers a metabolic treatment that taps into an evolved self-repair mode of the body, allowing for a profound "reset" of damaged systems rather than just a temporary metabolic shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

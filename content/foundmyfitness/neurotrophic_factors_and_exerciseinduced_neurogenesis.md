Exercise plays a significant role in promoting brain health through its influence on neurotrophic factors and the process of neurogenesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Myokines and Microglia
Exercise contributes to beneficial changes in trophic support for the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. A brief increase in immune molecules produced from muscle tissue, known as myokines, can stimulate the brain's resident immune cells, microglia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. These stimulated microglia then produce neurotrophic factors, which are growth factors essential for the production of new brain cells, a process called neurogenesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

One such myokine is IL-6 (interleukin-6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. While IL-6 is often considered an inflammatory cytokine, in the context of exercise, it acts as a myokine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. IL-6 is crucial for exercise-induced insulin sensitivity, and blocking it in rodents prevents the beneficial metabolic effects of exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

Dr. Charles Raison elaborates on the complex nature of inflammation and its effects:
> "so now I think what's going on is that you know so you know you talk about about the immune system and the brain being one unified organ really of course sore the muscles and and io6 which is it is we think it was mostly an inflammatory cytokine in the context of sickness is a mile kind in the context of exercise and we know in the context of exercise that aisle six plays a key role in exercises ability to induce insulin sensitivity so if you block aisle six in a rope that exercises you block all the beneficial metabolic effects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>

Raison also describes an animal study where severe stress led to inflammation, apoptosis (death) of microglial cells, and anxious-depressive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Blocking inflammation *before* the stressor prevented apoptosis and behavioral issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. However, blocking inflammation *after* the stressor made the rodents worse, while stimulating inflammation afterwards produced an antidepressant response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This suggests that certain inflammatory molecules, like TNF (tumor necrosis factor-alpha), IL-1 beta, and IL-6, may have [[neuroprotective effects of ketones and exercise | neurotrophic effects]] at lower levels in the brain, potentially acting as a hormetic stressor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)
One of the most crucial and beneficial neurotrophic factors produced during exercise is [[role_of_exercise_in_brain_health | Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor]] (BDNF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Role of BDNF
BDNF is found throughout the body and brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. In the brain, it is vital for:
*   Promoting the growth of new neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>
*   Enhancing the survival of existing neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>
*   Playing a significant role in neuroplasticity, which is the brain's capacity to remodel and reorganize itself based on experiences, behavior, and genetics, by forming new neural connections throughout life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### BDNF and Depression
Neuroplasticity is disrupted in depression and other mental health disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Changes in neuroplasticity caused by stress and other negative stimuli are implicated in the development and onset of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Individuals with depression often show reductions in serum and plasma BDNF levels, as well as decreases in BDNF in specific brain regions in major depressive disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Stress and other factors can reduce BDNF levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Exercise's Impact on BDNF
[[Benefits of vigorous exercise for longevity and brain health | Exercise]] consistently increases BDNF in serum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This serum BDNF can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert beneficial effects in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Physical activity leads to an average 32% increase in serum BDNF levels compared to baseline, and about a 45% increase compared to controlled conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

Both exercise duration and intensity are important for BDNF production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. For example, moderate and [[vigorous_exercise_and_brain_health | intense physical exercise]] for 40 minutes produces more BDNF than moderate or intense exercise for 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Animal studies consistently demonstrate that exercise increases BDNF and neurogenesis in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

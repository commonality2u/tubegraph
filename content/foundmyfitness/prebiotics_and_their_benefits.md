Prebiotics are specific types of [[dietary_fiber_and_its_role_in_gut_health_and_inflammation_prevention | fiber]] that are fermentable by microorganisms in the gut microbiome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. They are referred to as prebiotics because they nourish the beneficial bacteria residing in the gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## Importance of Dietary Fiber

Modern diets often lack sufficient [[dietary_fiber_and_its_role_in_gut_health_and_inflammation_prevention | fiber]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Traditional hunter-gatherer societies are estimated to have consumed ten times more [[dietary_fiber_and_its_role_in_gut_health_and_inflammation_prevention | fiber]] than current dietary intakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. For example, modern-day Tanzanian hunter-gatherer societies consume around 100 to 150 grams of [[dietary_fiber_and_its_role_in_gut_health_and_inflammation_prevention | fiber]] per day, significantly more than the estimated 10 grams per day for Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The Mayo Clinic recommends a daily intake of at least 38 grams of [[dietary_fiber_and_its_role_in_gut_health_and_inflammation_prevention | fiber]] for men and 25 grams for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Why Whole Foods are Preferred

Using a food processor or blender instead of a juicer for smoothies is beneficial because it retains the [[dietary_fiber_and_its_role_in_gut_health_and_inflammation_prevention | fiber]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Removing [[dietary_fiber_and_its_role_in_gut_health_and_inflammation_prevention | fiber]] by juicing eliminates a key component for gut health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Prebiotic Sources in the Smoothie

A diverse array of vegetables and fruits contributes various prebiotics to the diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Specific prebiotics found in this smoothie recipe include:
*   **Pectin:** Found in berries and apple skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Sulfoquinovose:** Present in green leafy vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

Both pectin and sulfoquinovose nourish different types of beneficial gut bacteria, contributing to gut protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Benefits of Prebiotics and Fiber

### Enhancing Gut Microbiome Diversity
Consuming a wide variety of fermentable [[gut_health_and_fiber_types | fiber types]] is the most effective way to increase microbial diversity in the gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Different prebiotics feed different types of microbial species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Supporting Gut Function
In addition to fermentable [[gut_health_and_fiber_types | fiber types]] (prebiotics), vegetables in the smoothie also provide non-fermentable [[gut_health_and_fiber_types | fiber types]] such as lignins and cellulose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. While these do not feed gut bacteria, they help food and waste move efficiently through the gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

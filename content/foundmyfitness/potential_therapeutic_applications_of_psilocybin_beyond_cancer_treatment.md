Psilocybin, a compound found in certain mushrooms, is being investigated for its therapeutic potential in treating various psychological conditions beyond its initial focus on cancer patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Dr. Roland Griffiths, a clinical pharmacologist at Johns Hopkins University, highlights decades of research into mood-altering substances, including classic psychedelics like psilocybin, LSD, DMT, and mescaline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Historical Context and Renewed Research
Research into classic hallucinogens largely ceased in the late 1960s due to the [[psychedelic_research_and_historical_context | psychedelic movement]] and cultural reactivity, leading to these drugs being placed into Schedule I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This halted clinical research for several decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. However, new rigorous clinical standards have allowed for a resurgence of studies, starting with healthy volunteers about a decade ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Core Findings: Profound and Lasting Impact
Initial studies in healthy volunteers revealed that psilocybin, when administered under carefully selected, supported, and prepared conditions, induces experiences described as deeply and profoundly personally and spiritually meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. These experiences are highly valued by participants months later, often rated among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant of their lives, comparable to the birth of a child or the death of a parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Unlike other mood-altering drugs, psilocybin's effects lead to long-term changes in attitudes, moods, and behavior, with people feeling they have learned something personally important that provides information value for their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### The Role of [[mystical_experiences_induced_by_psychedelic_therapies | Mystical-Type Experiences]]
A significant component of the psilocybin experience maps onto classically occurring [[mystical_experiences_induced_by_psychedelic_therapies | mystical-type experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Key features include:
*   **Sense of Unity:** An interconnectedness of all people and things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Sacredness/Reverence:** A humbling and sacred quality to the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Authenticity/Truth Value:** Often perceived as "more real and more true than everyday waking consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Positive Moods:** Feelings of "hard opening" or love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Transcendence:** Dissolution of time and space, with past and future collapsing into the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Ineffability:** Difficulty in putting the experience into words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

These experiences are considered reorganizational, leading individuals to reflect on them daily and alter how they perceive themselves and others in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Therapeutic Applications Beyond Cancer

### Cancer-Related Distress (Initial Focus)
A significant study published by Johns Hopkins University and NYU examined the [[psilocybin_and_its_effects_on_depression_and_anxiety_in_cancer_patients | effects of psilocybin on depressive symptoms and anxiety in patients with late-stage cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This population often experiences severe existential anxiety and depression with limited effective treatment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The study found striking, large, and sustained decreases in anxiety and depression after a single psilocybin treatment, with effects lasting up to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Although not a cure for cancer, it significantly improved quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

### Treatment-Resistant Depression
Following a pilot study from the UK on treatment-resistant depression, Johns Hopkins is launching a new trial to investigate psilocybin's effectiveness for this condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. This represents a potentially distinct application from cancer-related distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

### Addictions
Psilocybin's capacity for "reorganizational experiences" may be applicable to treating addictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Smoking Cessation:** A pilot study with 15 cigarette smokers, where psilocybin was embedded in cognitive behavioral therapy, yielded an astonishing 80% abstinence rate at six months, far exceeding typical treatments like varenicline (20-30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. A controlled trial is currently underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.
*   **Alcoholism:** Work is ongoing at NYU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.
*   **Cocaine Dependence:** Research is being conducted at the University of Alabama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>.

### Other Potential Applications
The reorganizational capacity of psilocybin suggests potential therapeutic applications for conditions such as:
*   PTSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>
*   OCD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>
*   Eating disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>
*   **End-of-Life Care (General Population):** Given that everyone faces death, this intervention may be relevant for broader end-of-life care, probing the "existential dimension of meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

## Underlying Mechanisms
The precise mechanisms are still being explored, but current understanding includes:
*   **Serotonergic Activity:** Psilocybin is a serotonergic agonist, primarily activating 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. The major effects are thought to be downstream and glutamate-mediated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>, potentially linking it to the antidepressant effects seen with ketamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.
*   **Neurogenesis:** Animal studies have shown psilocybin can increase neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and cause fear extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Emerging unpublished work from Barcelona is further examining classic hallucinogens and neurogenesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.
*   **Default Mode Network (DMN):** Neuroimaging studies suggest that psilocybin acutely decreases activity within the DMN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. The DMN is associated with rumination and self-referential processing, which is often increased in depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. Interestingly, DMN activity is also decreased in long-term meditators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>, aligning with meditation's goal of fostering present-moment awareness and reducing egoic holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
*   **Neuroplasticity:** The "reorganizational experiences" induced by psilocybin inherently suggest complex neuroplastic changes in the brain, though the specific loci of these changes are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.
*   **Personality Changes:** Enduring changes in the personality dimension of "openness" have been observed after psilocybin-induced [[mystical_experiences_induced_by_psychedelic_therapies | mystical-type experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. This is notable as personality characteristics are generally considered "locked in" from the mid-20s, with openness typically decreasing over a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.

## Important Considerations and Risks
While promising, psilocybin therapy requires highly controlled conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.
*   **Context and Support:** Effects are an interaction of context and pharmacology; it is not just the drug itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>. Sessions involve extensive preparation (at least eight hours) to build rapport and trust, ensuring safety during high-dose experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Two trained facilitators are present to provide reassurance and ensure safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Risks:** There are risks associated with taking psilocybin without proper support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. A survey found that about 10% of users reported putting themselves or others at risk of physical harm, and some experienced enduring psychological problems requiring professional help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>. These dangers often arise from fear or anxiety responses when individuals take the compound without knowing the dose, or without support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.
*   **Vulnerable Populations:** Individuals with pre-existing vulnerabilities to psychotic or bipolar disorders, or certain personality disorders, may be unusually sensitive to negative effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. Screening protocols exclude individuals with a history of such disorders in themselves or even second-degree relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.
*   **Challenging Experiences:** Even in controlled settings, about 30% of volunteers experience significant fear or anxiety during the session, which are not currently preventable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>. However, with support, these experiences can sometimes lead to greater insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. The ability to predict who will have a difficult experience is almost zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
*   **Dose-Dependency:** The effects, including [[mystical_experiences_induced_by_psychedelic_therapies | mystical experiences]] and challenging experiences, are dose-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>. Higher doses (e.g., 30 mg/70 kg) increase the probability of very difficult experiences, while slightly lower doses (e.g., 20-22 mg/70 kg) are effective with fewer challenging experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.
*   **Expectancy Effects:** While expectation and "set and setting" can influence the experience, they do not fully account for the profound changes observed with psilocybin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

## Psilocybin and Meditation
Psilocybin's effects show parallels with meditation, particularly in its impact on the DMN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. Researchers suggest psilocybin can be seen as a "crash course" for exploring the nature of mind, providing abrupt shifts in consciousness that reveal the normative way of holding reality is just one way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. However, it is not a substitute for meditation, as it doesn't lead to the same stability of awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.

## Indigenous Use
Psilocybin has a long history of use (hundreds of years) in cultures like Mexico, and DMT (in brews like Ayahuasca) in South America, and mescaline (in peyote) by American Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. Importantly, indigenous use of these compounds is typically in a highly controlled cultural context for religious, healing, or divination purposes, not casually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

## Future Directions
The field is in the early stages of communicating with the FDA about undertaking Phase III clinical trials for psilocybin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. If efficacy is demonstrated, there is potential for psilocybin to be approved as a medication under very constrained conditions, likely dispensed to specialized clinics with trained clinicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.

## Other Psychedelic Substances
*   **Ketamine:** While a dissociative anesthetic, ketamine is sometimes considered a psychedelic due to some shared phenomenological qualities and downstream effects on the glutamate system, though its mechanism is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. It has shown significant but short-lived antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   **Salvinorin A:** This short-acting hallucinogen, primarily acting on kappa-opioid receptors, produces a profoundly altered reality experience, but generally not a [[mystical_experiences_induced_by_psychedelic_therapies | mystical experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>. The effects are very short-lived (less than 10 minutes) and typically not enjoyed, consistent with dynorphin's dysphoric effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a>. It does not appear to have the same reorganizational meaning as classic hallucinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>.
*   **DMT (Dimethyltryptamine):** A very short-acting classic hallucinogen of the serotonin type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>. When combined with an MAO inhibitor in ayahuasca, its duration of action changes, making it more akin to psilocybin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>.

A [[comparative_study_of_different_psychedelic_substances | direct comparative pharmacology studies]] between these compounds are yet to be conducted to fully understand their differences and similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>.

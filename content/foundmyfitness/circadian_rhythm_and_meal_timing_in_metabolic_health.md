Dr. Ruth Patterson, a professor at the UCSD Department of Family Medicine and Public Health and leader of the Cancer Prevention program at Moores Cancer Center, UCSD, conducts research on the interface between metabolism and breast cancer risk and recurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Lifestyle Factors and Breast Cancer Risk

Several modifiable lifestyle factors are known to increase breast cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:
*   **Obesity** is a significant factor, potentially increasing breast cancer risk by twofold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Physical activity** is also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Dietary patterns** are more impactful than individual foods or nutrients; for instance, the Mediterranean dietary pattern may influence risk over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Tobacco** can also increase breast cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Mechanisms Linking Obesity to Breast Cancer
Obesity contributes to breast cancer risk through several mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:
*   Increased inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   Increased estrogen levels, partly because fat tissue can secrete estrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Estrogen acts as a growth factor, promoting tumor growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Increased fasting insulin levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Insulin is also a powerful growth factor that encourages metabolism, and high circulating insulin levels are central to breast cancer development and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   High insulin levels are found in overweight individuals, those less physically active, and diabetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   High insulin levels lead to lower levels of serum-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which normally binds and inactivates estrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This suggests an interconnectedness between these pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

These growth factors promote the survival and growth of damaged or cancerous cells, rather than allowing them to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The combination of inflammation, high insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and high estrogen creates a detrimental environment that allows cancer cells to survive and proliferate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Key Metabolic Biomarkers and Risk
Three major metabolic pathways contribute to a "fertile soil" for cancer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>:
*   High fasting insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
*   High free estrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>
*   High inflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>

Each of these individually increases breast cancer risk by about twofold, and while their combined effect is not strictly additive, it is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Crucially, these biomarkers can be modified through lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_circadiantimed_eating_in_metabolic_health | Time-Restricted Eating]] and [[Circadian rhythms and their impact on health | Circadian Rhythm]]

Dr. Patterson's recent research focuses on the [[TimeRestricted Eating and Its Effects on Metabolism | timing of meals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Humans evolved to eat during the day and fast at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Modern lifestyles, with late-night eating, are metabolically detrimental, as the body should be in a fasting catabolic state during rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Many people consume their largest meal in the evening, which is counterintuitive to the body's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### [[TimeRestricted Eating and its Impact on Circadian Rhythm | Circadian Rhythms]] and Metabolism
[[Circadian rhythms and their impact on health | Circadian rhythm]] refers to the body's biological clock, which regulates about 10-15% of the human genome, with roughly 50% of those genes involved in metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

*   Humans are most insulin sensitive upon waking in the morning, and insulin sensitivity decreases throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   Eating the biggest meal in the evening, when insulin insensitivity is highest, can increase insulin levels and metabolically dysregulate the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   The master [[circadian_rhythms_and_their_impact_on_health | clock]] (entrained by light) signals rest at night, but eating activates peripheral clocks (e.g., in the liver), leading to a desynchronization that causes metabolic dysregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   Dr. Satchin Panda's research shows that the first non-water beverage or meal starts the peripheral clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Eating all meals within a 12-hour window from that start time is important for [[Fasting and metabolic health | metabolic health]], including glucose regulation, insulin sensitivity, and fat loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

## Study on Fasting and Breast Cancer Recurrence

A study involving 2,500 breast cancer survivors tracked their food records over seven and a half years, re-analyzing data based on meal timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   **Key Finding**: At least 13 hours of nightly fasting was associated with a 40% reduction in breast cancer recurrence in this sample of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   The fast should ideally start around 7-8 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   Skipping breakfast is often a marker of late-night eating, as those who stop eating early are typically hungry in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   This specific timing allows for a long stretch of "gut rest," which is thought to be beneficial for the [[circadian_rhythm_and_gut_bacteria | gut microbiome]] and overall GI tract health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

### Broader Health Implications
While Dr. Patterson's research focuses on breast cancer, this [[Dietary practices and metabolic health | dietary pattern]] is believed to positively affect other conditions, including:
*   [[Fasting and metabolic health | Type II diabetes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>
*   Fatty liver (NAFLD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>
*   Acid reflux, which can lead to esophageal cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

The benefits observed in the breast cancer recurrence study were independent of *what* was eaten and whether the individuals were overweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

### Feasibility and Acceptability
Pilot studies have shown that adopting a longer nightly fasting interval is simple and highly acceptable to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. Participants reported improved sleep and increased self-efficacy that spread to other healthy behaviors like walking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. This approach is seen as a valuable public health intervention because of its ease of implementation, potentially shifting disease risk across the entire population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

## Impact on Metabolic Biomarkers

The most consistent effect of longer fasting has been observed on **Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c)**, a marker of average glucose levels over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   Women who fasted longer consistently showed lower HbA1c levels in both national surveys and breast cancer survivor cohorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.
*   This suggests a significant potential for reducing the risk of [[Fasting and metabolic health | diabetes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.
*   Since HbA1c takes about three months to reflect changes, the intervention's full effect on this marker would be seen over that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

Regarding **inflammation**, a reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP) was observed *only* among women whose fasting interval occurred early in the day (e.g., 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.), not if the fast started later (e.g., 9 p.m. to 9 a.m.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of aligning fasting with the natural [[circadian_rhythms_and_their_impact_on_health | circadian rhythm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

## Potential Mechanisms and Broader Impacts

### Fasting and Repair Mechanisms
Fasting, particularly during the nighttime sleep period, appears crucial for the body's repair mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. Just as muscles need rest to repair after exercise, the body needs time off from the oxidative damage that occurs during metabolism to allow DNA repair and autophagy (clearing damaged cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. Clearing damaged cells that secrete inflammatory mediators could contribute to lower inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

### Meal Frequency
The impact of meal frequency within the established eating window is less clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. Reducing the overall eating window may naturally lead to fewer eating occasions, but studies are ongoing to clarify this relationship with disease risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.

### Beyond Weight Loss
While [[TimeRestricted Eating and Its Effects on Metabolism | time-restricted eating]] may lead to modest weight loss (e.g., ~2 pounds in a month during pilot studies), its positive effects on metabolism and health biomarkers appear to be independent of significant weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. The primary benefit seems to come from aligning food intake with the body's optimal metabolic timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

### Other Synergistic Benefits
*   **Improved Sleep**: Longer fasting durations are associated with improved sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. Poor sleep itself can negatively affect biomarkers and metabolism, so better sleep contributes to the overall positive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.
*   **Spontaneous Activity**: Animal studies suggest that time-restricted feeding can lead to improvements in spontaneous physical activity, which accounts for most people's daily movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

## Lifestyle Choices vs. Genetics in Disease Risk

While genetic factors like BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations significantly increase breast cancer risk for a small percentage of women, the vast majority (65-75%) of cancers are sporadic and influenced by lifestyle factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.

Key modifiable lifestyle factors for overall health and disease prevention include:
*   Avoiding smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>
*   Moderating alcohol intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>
*   Achieving even modest weight loss (e.g., 5%), which can significantly improve metabolic health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>
*   Improving [[Dietary practices and metabolic health | diet quality]] and [[the_role_of_circadiantimed_eating_in_metabolic_health | meal timing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>
*   Engaging in physical activity and avoiding prolonged sedentary behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>
*   Prioritizing [[Impact of sleep on metabolic health | good sleep]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>

These healthy behaviors offer a "total benefit package" that can significantly reduce the risk of major diseases, including cardiovascular disease (the leading killer of women), [[Fasting and metabolic health | diabetes]], and various cancers, while also improving overall quality of life and mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. The pathways for different diseases are much more overlapping than previously thought, meaning the same set of healthful behaviors offers comprehensive protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.

Even occasional deviations from time-restricted eating, such as on weekends, may not negate the benefits, suggesting that consistency most of the time is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. This makes [[Fasting and metabolic health | time-restricted eating]] a practical and impactful strategy for improving metabolic health and reducing disease risk.

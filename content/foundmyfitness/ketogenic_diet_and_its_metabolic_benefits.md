From: [[foundmyfitness]] <br/> 

The [[ketogenic diet experiments | ketogenic diet]], often referred to as "keto," has seen an explosion in popularity, though its definition has become somewhat commoditized and commercialized in the mainstream [01:14:14]. Dr. Dom D'Agostino, an associate professor at the University of South Florida and a research scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, emphasizes the scientific basis of the diet, its metabolic state, and the use of [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | ketone supplements]] [00:00:50, 01:14:14, 01:38:09].

## What is a Ketogenic Diet?

A ketogenic diet is unique because it is defined by an objective biomarker: ketones, which can be measured in blood, urine, or breath [02:22:21, 02:26:51, 02:27:33]. If an individual is not in a state of hyperketonemia (elevated ketones), they are not technically on a ketogenic diet [02:39:09].

To achieve higher, therapeutically relevant levels of ketones, the diet typically requires significantly increased fat intake, particularly reduced carbohydrates, and moderate protein [03:02:02]. A clinical ketogenic diet, while not the best choice for many, involves various fat-to-carb-and-protein ratios [03:13:13, 03:18:18].

Different variations of the diet include:
*   **Classical Ketogenic Diet**: A 4:1 ratio (90% fat to one part protein and carbohydrates) [03:22:58, 03:26:26]. In extreme cases, a 5:1 ratio is used [05:33:04]. This was traditionally used for [[Ketogenic diet in treating neurological disorders | pediatric epilepsy]] [03:55:04].
*   **Modified Ketogenic Diet / Modified Atkins / Low Glycemic Index Therapy (LGIT)**: Ratios such as 3:1, 2:1, or 1.5:1, and a 1:1 ketogenic diet [03:30:17, 03:57:07, 05:39:04]. Dr. D'Agostino personally follows a variation that produces a mild state of [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] [03:44:03, 03:48:09].

## Mechanism of Action

A ketogenic diet induces [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] primarily by suppressing insulin, acting almost like insulin suppression therapy [04:22:30]. This suppression depletes liver glycogen, accelerating the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver, which in turn increases the production of acetyl-CoA, condensing into acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate [04:37:04, 04:50:09].

This metabolic state mimics [[fasting_and_metabolic_health | fasting]] by leading to low insulin and low IGF-1, with a slight suppression of mTOR due to moderated protein intake [05:14:00, 05:22:04].

## Implementing a Ketogenic Diet

### Monitoring and Tracking
People need to monitor and track nutrients and calories, especially initially, as the caloric density of a ketogenic diet can be 50% higher than a standard diet [00:14:14, 01:16:21, 01:16:51, 01:16:56]. While the body typically has feedback mechanisms for satiety, these may not work well for everyone, necessitating calorie and macronutrient counting [00:29:00, 00:36:00, 01:16:37].

### Transitioning into the Diet
For those using the diet for a metabolic or brain disorder like [[Ketogenic diet in treating neurological disorders | epilepsy]], starting with a clinical ketogenic diet under the supervision of a registered dietitian and neurological team is recommended [10:25:05]. An induction phase involving [[fasting_and_metabolic_health | fasting]] can facilitate metabolic switching from glucose to fat and ketone utilization [10:47:04, 11:04:00].

For a lifestyle approach, a gradual transition over four to six weeks, by titrating carbohydrates down, can improve compliance and adherence, leading to better results and fewer side effects [11:32:04, 11:39:04, 13:07:07].

### Side Effects of Abrupt Start
Abruptly starting a ketogenic diet without calorie restriction can lead to side effects such as:
*   Sleep disruption [12:26:00, 12:33:04]
*   Lipid abnormalities [12:33:04]
*   Elevated triglycerides [12:33:04]
*   A quick spike in LDL [12:39:04]
*   Calorie restriction with a ketogenic diet can mitigate many negative effects associated with high-fat diets [12:45:00, 13:01:04].

### Importance of Fiber and Fats
Dr. D'Agostino's modified ketogenic diet often includes 10-20% carbohydrates from fibrous, non-glycemic vegetables like leafy greens [13:33:04, 13:40:04]. Fiber helps slow digestion, moderates protein digestion, delays gastric absorption, and is crucial for enhancing and preserving the gut microbiome [14:02:00, 14:09:00, 14:14:00, 14:20:00, 14:39:00, 14:58:00].

The types of fats in the diet are also important:
*   **Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs)**: Found in olive oil, avocados, and nuts, are preferable [18:38:00, 26:55:00, 28:53:00, 29:00:00].
*   **Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs)**: Found in fatty fish like salmon [18:44:00, 29:20:00].
*   **Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCTs)**: These saturated fats do not disrupt the gut microbiome like other fatty acids and can help elevate ketones [18:09:00, 18:44:00, 18:51:00, 19:11:00, 27:02:00, 28:53:00].

Cooking green vegetables can rupture cell walls, making carbohydrates more accessible and impacting glycemic response compared to raw greens [16:56:00, 17:00:00, 17:05:00, 17:15:00, 17:27:00]. Eating fats and fiber with a meal, especially upfront, can attenuate the insulin response and help maintain ketosis [21:08:00, 21:17:00].

### Considerations for Genetic Variants and Contraindications
For individuals with the APOE4 allele (about one-quarter of the population), an extremely high-fat diet may not be ideal [24:05:00, 25:22:00, 25:33:04, 27:48:00]. A more moderate approach, restricting carbohydrates and ensuring plenty of fiber and phytonutrients, is suggested [25:38:00, 25:42:00].

**Contraindications**: Some inborn errors of metabolism, such as carnitine transferase deficiency (CPT1), make a ketogenic diet potentially deadly [22:09:00, 22:15:00, 22:22:00].

### Biomarkers to Monitor
When on a ketogenic diet, it's important to monitor:
*   **Blood Glucose**: Should be relatively flat on a [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketogenic diet]] [23:50:00, 24:01:04, 32:46:00, 32:53:00, 33:34:00, 33:42:00, 27:52:00, 28:04:00, 32:46:00, 33:34:00, 28:22:00, 32:46:00]. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) can be very insightful [27:52:00, 27:58:00, 32:56:00].
*   **Ketone Levels**: Can be measured in blood, breath, or urine. Blood ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) are a direct measure [22:26:00, 22:33:04, 27:33:04, 28:13:00]. Breath acetone correlates well with fat oxidation and seizure control [29:48:00, 30:08:00, 31:25:00].
*   **Lipid Panels**: To check for elevated triglycerides or LDL, especially when rapidly starting the diet [12:33:04, 23:05:00, 23:11:04, 23:19:04].
*   **Liver Enzymes**: Can be elevated with certain [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | ketone supplements]] like 1,3-butanediol at high doses [56:50:00, 56:54:00].
*   **Micronutrient Status**: To avoid deficiencies like selenium, which can lead to cardiomyopathy [26:01:04, 26:09:04, 26:14:04, 26:19:04]. Appropriate supplementation or diet formulation can prevent this [26:24:04, 26:30:04].

## Exogenous Ketones

[[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | Exogenous ketones]] are molecules that can elevate bioidentical ketone bodies in the blood and tissues [38:01:00, 38:07:00, 38:11:04]. They are developed for individuals unwilling or unable to adhere to a strict ketogenic diet [30:56:00, 31:03:04].

Different formulations exist, including:
*   **Ketone Esters**: Such as 1,3-butanediol beta-hydroxybutyrate monoester or diester [30:26:00, 43:04:00, 50:16:00, 50:27:00, 50:42:00, 50:47:00, 51:01:00]. They can cause a very rapid and high spike in ketones, which may lead to an insulin release and temporary hypoglycemia [41:13:04, 41:21:04, 41:28:00, 41:51:04, 43:16:04, 43:22:04, 43:31:04, 43:38:00].
*   **Ketone Salts**: Beta-hydroxybutyrate bound to electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium [30:30:04, 42:20:04, 42:27:04]. Electrolytes and MCTs can delay gastric absorption, leading to a slower, more sustained rise in ketones without a sharp spike [40:36:04, 40:43:04, 42:45:04, 42:50:04].
*   **MCT Oils/Powders**: Serve as [[ketogenic_diet_experiments | ketogenic fats]] that are metabolized into ketones [30:26:00, 31:17:04, 50:02:00, 50:08:00].

Ideally, [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | ketone supplements]] should cause a predictable but gradual rise in ketones, sustained for a period, with a predictable decrease [42:00:04, 42:07:04, 42:14:04]. Maintaining ketone levels between 1-3 millimolar is generally considered optimal, as higher levels can lead to metabolic acidosis and pH drops [54:42:04, 54:48:00, 54:58:00].

Ketones act not only as an alternative energy source for the brain, heart, and other tissues, but also as a "signaling molecule" or "drug-like mediator" that mediates beneficial effects [33:54:00, 34:00:00, 34:08:00, 34:13:04, 34:19:04]. These effects include:
*   Elevating adenosine [34:25:00]
*   Activating GPR109A receptors [34:25:00]
*   Anti-inflammatory pathways [34:25:00]
*   Reducing mitochondrial ROS production [34:40:04, 34:47:04]
*   Changing brain neuropharmacology, such as increasing GABAergic tone [35:29:00, 36:10:04, 36:37:04]

Dr. D'Agostino views ketones as potentially "the next [[neuroprotective_effects_of_ketones_and_exercise | creatine]]" due to their expanding research and potential benefits, noting that the literature is still nascent compared to creatine [38:46:00, 38:50:00].

## Benefits and Applications

### Neurological Disorders
The [[Ketogenic diet in treating neurological disorders | ketogenic diet]] is a widely accepted medical therapy for [[Ketogenic diet in treating neurological disorders | epilepsy]] and [[Ketogenic diet in treating neurological disorders | metabolic disorders]] like Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome (GLUT1-DS) and PDH deficiency [21:49:00, 22:04:00, 54:58:00, 55:06:00, 55:12:00]. It works through multiple synergistic mechanisms, including increasing GABAergic tone [36:57:00, 37:03:04].

[[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | Ketone supplements]] have shown remarkable anti-seizure effects in animal models, even on a standard diet [35:23:00, 35:31:04, 50:47:00]. Acetoacetate specifically seems important for anti-seizure effects [52:11:00, 52:27:00, 52:34:04].

The [[Ketogenic diet in treating neurological disorders | ketogenic diet]] and [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | ketone supplements]] are also being researched for other neurological conditions:
*   **[[Ketogenic diet in treating neurological disorders | Alzheimer's Disease]]**: May be beneficial for patients with a metabolic phenotype, especially those with impaired glucose metabolism [27:15:04, 27:20:04, 27:26:04, 48:11:04, 48:16:04, 51:50:00, 51:54:00]. Some cases show acute improvements in tremors and cognition with MCTs or [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | ketone supplements]] [50:26:00, 50:32:00, 50:38:00, 50:45:00, 50:51:00].
*   **[[Ketogenic diet in treating neurological disorders | Parkinson's Disease]]**: Similar to Alzheimer's, some patients experience acute symptomatic relief with ketones [50:26:00, 52:04:00].
*   **Migraines**: The [[Ketogenic diet in treating neurological disorders | ketogenic diet]] and [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | exogenous ketones]] may help manage chronic migraines by increasing GABAergic tone, brain blood flow (via adenosine), and reducing neuroinflammation [55:52:00, 55:55:00, 56:48:00, 56:52:00, 57:03:04, 57:10:00, 57:16:00, 57:21:04, 57:28:00, 58:02:00, 58:06:00, 58:13:00, 58:19:00, 58:25:00, 58:32:00, 58:36:00, 58:42:00, 58:46:00, 58:53:00, 58:59:00, 59:04:00, 59:08:00, 59:14:00, 59:18:00, 59:25:00, 59:29:00, 02:00:32].

### Metabolic Health
The [[ketogenic_diet_experiments | ketogenic diet]] and [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] offer various metabolic benefits:
*   **Insulin Sensitivity and Glycemic Control**: By suppressing insulin, it can optimize metabolic parameters and glycemic variability [11:24:00, 11:32:04]. It can also improve insulin sensitivity [01:15:51].
*   **Weight Loss and Satiety**: Ketones have a satiating effect on the brain, helping with calorie restriction and weight loss by preventing energetic crises when glucose is low [01:18:00, 01:19:00, 01:47:18, 01:47:23, 01:47:29, 01:47:34, 01:48:06, 01:48:13, 01:48:18, 01:48:38, 01:48:43, 01:48:51, 01:48:58, 01:49:01].
*   **[[fasting_and_metabolic_health | Metabolic Switching]]**: Facilitates the body's transition from being primarily a glucose oxidizer to a fat and ketone utilizer [10:51:00].

### Muscle Mass and Performance
*   **[[neuroprotective_effects_of_ketones_and_exercise | Anti-catabolic Effects]]**: Ketones help prevent muscle loss during periods of [[fasting_and_metabolic_health | fasting]] or limited food availability, safeguarding against catabolic processes that would lead to muscle wasting [01:11:38, 01:11:45, 01:11:51, 01:11:57, 01:12:05, 01:12:10, 01:12:15, 01:12:22, 01:12:32, 01:12:36, 01:12:42]. Beta-hydroxybutyrate decreases gluconeogenic amino acids like alanine [01:09:19, 01:09:25, 01:09:30, 01:09:38, 01:09:43, 01:09:48]. Acetoacetate may stimulate skeletal muscle regeneration [01:08:21].
*   **Exercise Performance**: Ketones may have a small effect on aerobic performance [01:18:55]. The combination of [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | ketones]], caffeine, and electrolytes can be a powerful ergogenic aid [01:19:29, 01:19:37].
*   **Performance in Extreme Environments**: Ketones shine in preserving performance and resilience in environments like hyperoxia (high-pressure oxygen) and hypoxia (low oxygen), where carbohydrate supplements may not help [01:19:52, 01:19:59, 01:20:05, 01:20:12, 01:20:18, 01:20:25, 01:20:31, 01:20:38, 01:20:45, 01:20:52, 01:20:58, 01:21:03, 01:21:08, 01:21:13, 01:21:21, 01:21:27, 01:21:32, 01:21:38, 01:21:44, 01:22:19, 01:22:23].
*   **Adaptive Response to Exercise**: Chronic use of [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | exogenous ketones]] may facilitate the body's adaptive response to exercise over time by suppressing chronic inflammation [01:23:14, 01:23:22, 01:23:27, 01:23:31, 01:23:37, 01:23:44, 01:23:49, 01:23:54].

### Longevity and Healthspan
Rodent studies, particularly those involving cyclic ketogenic diets and [[fasting_and_metabolic_health | time-restricted feeding]], have shown improved [[effects_of_ketogenic_diet_on_longevity_and_healthspan | healthspan]] and median lifespan [01:31:55, 01:32:05, 01:32:26, 01:32:34, 01:38:03]. They also demonstrated enhanced cognition in older mice compared to younger ones [01:32:39, 01:32:45, 01:37:49]. These benefits are linked to suppressing age-related chronic diseases and spontaneous tumors [01:36:18, 01:36:25, 01:36:32, 01:36:38, 01:36:43, 01:36:48, 01:37:30].

### Immune System and Autoimmune Disease
Dietary interventions can modulate the immune system [02:01:51, 02:01:57]. The [[ketogenic_diets_role_in_cancer_and_metabolic_disorders | ketogenic diet]] can help with autoimmune conditions by potentially suppressing inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF alpha) and reducing intestinal permeability caused by hypersensitive immune responses [02:00:48, 02:00:53, 02:01:03, 02:01:07, 02:01:26, 02:01:31, 02:01:38, 02:01:46, 02:01:57, 02:02:06, 02:02:14, 02:02:22, 02:02:28, 02:02:34]. It can also augment the immune system, making it more hyper-vigilant against things like cancer cells [02:02:41, 02:02:49, 02:02:58].

### [[ketogenic_diets_role_in_cancer_and_metabolic_disorders | Cancer]]
The [[ketogenic_diets_role_in_cancer_and_metabolic_disorders | ketogenic diet]] can be a therapeutic approach for cancer by:
*   **Insulin Suppression**: Limiting glucose availability and suppressing the insulin pathway [02:11:57, 02:12:06, 02:12:11].
*   **Synergy with Standard Care**: It can make tumors more sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation while protecting normal, healthy cells and augmenting the immune system to attack cancer [02:03:16, 02:03:22, 02:03:29, 02:03:34, 02:03:41, 02:03:45, 02:03:50, 02:03:57, 02:04:01, 02:04:08, 02:04:12, 02:04:19, 02:04:26, 02:04:34, 02:05:15, 02:05:21, 02:05:26].
*   **Targeting Tumor Metabolism**: Most aggressive cancer cells primarily rely on fermentable fuels like glucose and glutamine due to damaged mitochondria and hypoxia within the tumor [02:10:03, 02:15:03, 02:15:09, 02:15:14, 02:15:24, 02:15:31, 02:15:36, 02:15:45, 02:15:50]. Ketones are not an ideal fuel for these tumors [02:16:04]. In the absence of glucose, tumor cells die [02:16:10]. Adding ketones can decrease proliferation, possibly by reducing hexokinase (a glycolytic enzyme) [02:16:16, 02:16:21].
*   **Preventative Potential**: Rodent studies have shown a reduction in spontaneous tumors with [[ketogenic_diet_experiments | ketogenic diets]], suggesting a preventative mechanism [01:36:43, 01:36:48, 01:37:44, 02:16:51, 02:16:56, 02:17:02, 02:17:09].

## Cyclical Ketogenic Diets and Intermittent Fasting

Chronic [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] may not be ideal or natural for most people unless managing a chronic disorder responsive to it [01:14:30, 01:14:38, 01:16:06]. Dr. D'Agostino believes in "relative changes" and intermittent approaches [01:14:44]. For example, he practices [[intermittent_fasting_and_ketosis | intermittent fasting]] 2-3 times a week to maximize benefits and avoid losing too much weight [01:14:54].

There is significant overlap between a [[ketogenic_diet_experiments | modified ketogenic diet]] and [[intermittent_fasting_and_ketosis | intermittent fasting]] due to shared hormonal effects (low insulin, low IGF-1, high AMP kinase, low mTOR) and the presence of hyperketonemia [01:45:36, 01:46:20, 01:46:28, 01:46:34]. This combination can enhance metabolic flexibility and overall health [01:27:00, 01:27:04, 01:27:10, 01:27:17, 01:27:22, 01:27:30].

## Carnivore Diet

A carnivore diet, consisting only of meat and no carbohydrates, is a form of ketogenic diet [01:10:00, 01:10:07, 01:10:07, 01:18:46, 01:18:54, 01:18:59, 01:20:54, 01:20:59]. While some individuals report benefits and thrive on it, Dr. D'Agostino observed his own LDL and triglycerides increase on it [01:19:07, 01:19:12, 01:19:19, 01:19:50, 01:19:56, 02:23:45].

Concerns about the carnivore diet include:
*   **Lack of Fiber and Phytonutrients**: This can impact gut health and overall micronutrient intake [01:17:00, 01:17:14, 02:11:13, 02:11:17, 02:11:23, 02:11:31, 02:11:36, 02:11:42, 02:19:12, 02:19:56, 02:21:14, 02:21:17, 02:21:50, 02:22:03]. Butyrate, a primary fuel for colonocytes, is produced from fiber by gut bacteria [01:55:04, 01:55:10, 01:55:15, 01:55:22, 01:55:27, 02:21:53, 02:21:56, 02:22:07].
*   **Sustainability and Optimal Long-Term Use**: While sustainable for some, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting it as an optimal long-term strategy [02:20:30, 02:20:36, 02:20:42, 02:20:48].
*   **Calorie Intake**: Similar to other diets, a calorie deficit is important for potential benefits [02:20:24, 02:24:10, 02:24:21, 02:24:26, 02:24:31, 02:24:35, 02:24:41].

## Monitoring Ketosis

Measuring ketones is essential for confirming a state of [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]]:
*   **Urine Strips**: Useful for initial, semi-quantitative assessment of ketosis [02:31:50, 02:31:55, 02:38:38].
*   **Blood Ketone Meters**: Provide accurate blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (e.g., Keto-Mojo device) [02:31:44, 02:32:00].
*   **Breath Acetone Meters**: Good for tracking fat oxidation and weight loss, and more stable than blood ketones as the body uses BHB for fuel [02:29:48, 02:30:08, 02:30:13, 02:30:18, 02:30:23, 02:30:28, 02:30:38, 02:32:06].
*   **Glucose Ketone Index (GKI)**: Calculated as glucose over ketones (in millimolar concentration), it's a measure of metabolic state. A GKI of one after 72 hours of [[fasting_and_metabolic_health | fasting]] may maximize autophagy [02:28:42, 02:28:48, 02:28:59, 02:29:05, 02:29:12, 02:29:17, 02:29:25].
*   **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)**: Can be used to assess dietary adherence to a ketogenic diet, as glucose traces should be relatively flat [02:32:29, 02:32:39, 02:32:46, 02:32:51, 02:32:56, 02:33:05].

## Supplements with Ketogenic Diet

Certain supplements can be beneficial when following a ketogenic diet:
*   **Electrolytes**: Important as the body tends to deplete them in [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] [00:57:23, 00:57:31, 00:57:45, 00:59:05].

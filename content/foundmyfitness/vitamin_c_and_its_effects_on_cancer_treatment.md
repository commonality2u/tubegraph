Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is widely recognized for its antioxidant properties and its role as a cofactor in numerous physiological processes, including immune function [03:31:31]. Historically, Dr. Linus Pauling, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist, was a prominent figure in advocating for vitamin C's potential benefits in cancer treatment [01:15:00].

## Linus Pauling's Contributions and Early Research
Dr. Linus Pauling found clinical evidence suggesting that high-dose intravenous administration of vitamin C could be a supportive treatment for cancer and a method to mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy [01:24:26]. While his studies were heavily criticized due to a lack of proper controls and standardization, subsequent clinical studies have suggested a beneficial use for intravenous vitamin C as an adjunctive therapy for cancer [01:55:57].

## Intravenous vs. Oral Administration
A key distinction in the research on vitamin C's effects on cancer is the method of administration:

*   **Oral Dosing:** If a person consumes five to nine servings of vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables daily, their steady-state plasma vitamin C concentrations will be around 80 micromoles per liter or less [02:20:20]. Peak plasma concentrations from oral intake won't exceed 220 micromoles per liter, even with a maximum oral dose of three grams taken six times daily [02:32:05]. Oral vitamin C absorption is dose-dependent and subject to transporter saturation, meaning bioavailability decreases after 500 milligrams in a single dose [02:48:48].
*   **Intravenous Dosing:** Intravenous vitamin C bypasses intestinal absorption and saturable transport mechanisms, allowing for much higher plasma concentrations [02:46:46]. It can produce plasma concentrations as high as 15,000 micromoles per liter, which is 68 times higher than can be achieved through oral consumption [02:46:46]. This significant increase in plasma levels is why intravenous administration holds promise as a therapeutic strategy against cancer [04:21:21].

## Mechanisms of Action in Cancer Treatment
While vitamin C acts primarily as an antioxidant at physiological concentrations (approximately 50 micromoles per liter), pharmacologic doses of intravenous vitamin C (greater than 1 gram) generate hydrogen peroxide [01:05:49]. Hydrogen peroxide is a type of reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA, RNA, and proteins, leading to tissue damage [01:06:01].

Multiple studies suggest that high-dose intravenous vitamin C can assist in cancer cell death, primarily due to the formation of hydrogen peroxide [01:06:10]. This may occur through an interaction with high levels of iron often found in cancer cells [01:06:20]. Cancer cells also frequently have lower levels of enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species compared to healthy cells, potentially increasing oxidative stress and causing cancer cells to die [01:06:28]. Notably, successive treatments with high-dose intravenous vitamin C do not increase pro-oxidative markers in healthy people, suggesting that normal cells are not damaged by this hydrogen peroxide burst [01:06:41].

Additionally, dehydroascorbic acid, the oxidized form of vitamin C, is imported into cells by glucose transporters [01:05:07]. High concentrations of dehydroascorbic acid might inhibit glucose uptake into cancer cells, thereby hindering the fuel utilization needed for cancer cell survival and growth, as most cancers rely on glucose for energy [01:05:32].

## Impact on Cancer Patients' Quality of Life
Intravenous vitamin C appears to improve the quality of life for cancer patients [01:05:57].
*   One study involving 39 patients with terminal cancer, who received 10 grams of intravenous vitamin C twice a week and 4 grams of oral vitamin C daily for a week, reported improvements in physical, emotional, and cognitive status, as well as reduced fatigue, nausea, vomiting, pain, and appetite loss [01:05:57].
*   An observational study of 125 breast cancer patients, 53 of whom received 7.5 grams of intravenous vitamin C once per week alongside standard chemotherapy and radiation, noted improved quality of life compared to patients who only received standard therapies [01:07:02].

## Safety and Considerations
[[safety_and_potential_side_effects_of_high_doses_of_vitamin_c | Intravenous vitamin C]] is generally well-tolerated and has low toxicity [01:09:17]. Common side effects are mild to moderate nausea, headache, and dry mouth, while less common ones include fatigue, hypertension, loss of appetite, and hyperglycemia [01:09:20].

However, high-dose intravenous vitamin C can have serious side effects in specific patient populations:
*   People with hemochromatosis (abnormally high iron levels) should be cautious due to vitamin C's ability to improve dietary iron absorption [01:09:00].
*   Individuals with a deficiency in the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase are at risk of hemolysis (rupturing of red blood cells) when given high doses (40 grams or higher) of intravenous vitamin C [01:09:41]. However, lower doses (1-10 grams) of intravenous vitamin C have been reported to reduce hemolysis, suggesting it might be safe for these individuals at lower doses [01:10:00].

Concerns about kidney stones from high oral doses of vitamin C are largely theoretical for healthy individuals. While oxalate, a metabolic end-product of vitamin C, can form crystals with calcium, large prospective studies have shown that a higher vitamin C intake does not lead to a greater incidence of kidney stones in reality [01:10:19]. Kidney impairment can increase this risk with high doses of intravenous vitamin C, leading to oxalate nephropathy [01:10:56].

## Future Research
Ongoing and future research will likely help determine specific types and stages of cancer, along with appropriate chemotherapy regimens, that would benefit from the use of intravenous vitamin C [01:56:19]. Overall, while more studies are needed, intravenous vitamin C offers promise as a therapeutic strategy against certain types of cancer and infections that oral supplementation cannot achieve [01:15:16].

Dr. Rhonda Patrick, a PhD, not a medical doctor, is passionate about sauna use, believing it will become part of standard care for preventing and treating various cardiovascular conditions within the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>. Her work focuses on the aging process and disease prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## [[Health benefits of sauna use | Health Benefits of Sauna Use]]

Emerging research, including observational studies, prospective studies, interventional trials, and mechanistic studies, suggests that sauna bathing improves overall health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:46">[03:02:46]</a>.

### [[Sauna use and cardiovascular health benefits | Cardiovascular Health Benefits]]

The Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, an ongoing prospective study from Eastern Finland, has provided significant data on sauna's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:15">[03:22:15]</a>. This study followed thousands of individuals, looking at various diseases over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:02">[03:33:02]</a>.

*   **Sudden Cardiac Death:**
    *   Men using the sauna 2-3 times/week had a 22% lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:05">[04:23:05]</a>.
    *   Men using the sauna 4-7 times/week had a 63% lower risk compared to those using it once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:11">[04:28:11]</a>.
    *   A dose-dependent effect was observed with duration: 11 minutes of sauna use was linked to a 7% lower risk, and 20 minutes was linked to a 50% reduction in sudden cardiac death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:43">[04:41:43]</a>. These findings were adjusted for confounding factors like cholesterol, triglycerides, hypertension, socioeconomic status, and physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:26">[05:02:26]</a>.
*   **Coronary Artery Heart Disease & Fatal Cardiovascular Mortality:**
    *   Sauna use 2-3 times/week was associated with a 23% lower coronary heart disease-related death risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:07">[05:27:07]</a>.
    *   Sauna use 4-7 times/week increased this to a 43% lower mortality risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:10">[05:35:10]</a>.
    *   Similar trends were seen for cardiovascular-related mortality: 27% lower for 2-3 times/week and 50% lower for 4-7 times/week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:11">[05:46:11]</a>.
*   **Stroke Risk:**
    *   Using the sauna 2-3 times/week resulted in a 14% lower stroke risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:41">[06:17:41]</a>.
    *   Using it 4-7 times/week led to a 60% lower stroke risk in both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:46">[06:21:46]</a>.
*   **Hypertension:**
    *   Sauna use 4-7 times/week showed a robust 50% reduction in hypertension risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:04">[06:47:04]</a>.
    *   A single 30-minute Finnish sauna session can lower blood pressure and improve arterial compliance (the ability of blood vessels to expand and contract) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:49">[06:56:49]</a>.

### [[Impact of sauna use on longevity and allcause mortality | Longevity and All-Cause Mortality]]

*   **All-Cause Mortality:** The Kuopio study also found that men using the sauna 2-3 times/week had a 27% lower risk of all-cause mortality, and 4-7 times/week showed a 40% lower risk compared to once a week users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:48">[14:40:48]</a>.
*   **Alzheimer's Disease & Dementia:**
    *   Sauna use 2-3 times/week was associated with a 20% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and similar reductions for dementia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:26">[15:24:26]</a>.
    *   Using the sauna 4-7 times/week showed a 60% lower risk for both conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:07">[15:31:07]</a>. Vascular health is important for both heart and brain health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:21">[15:16:21]</a>.
*   **Lower Organisms Lifespan:** A single brief heat exposure in C. elegans (nematode worms) and Drosophila (fruit flies) can increase their lifespan by up to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:07">[16:05:07]</a>. This effect is dependent on heat shock proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.

## [[Mechanisms behind sauna benefits on cardiovascular health | Mechanisms of Sauna Benefits]]

The physiological responses in a sauna share significant overlap with those during physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:44">[11:07:44]</a>.

*   **Physiological Response:** Skin temperature increases, blood flow shifts from organs to the skin (50-70% redistribution) to facilitate sweating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:05">[11:16:05]</a>. Heart rate increases up to 150 beats per minute, equivalent to moderate physical activity, and cardiac output increases by 60-70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:04">[11:33:04]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Exercise:** A study published in *Complementary Therapies of Medicine* showed that a 25-minute sauna session had identical effects on heart rate and blood pressure as a 25-minute session on a stationary bike at 100 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:34">[11:58:34]</a>. Immediately after both activities, heart rate and blood pressure were lower than baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.
*   **Autonomic Nervous System:** Sauna use improves heart rate variability (HRV), which indicates a better capacity of the heart to respond favorably under stressful conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:04">[12:47:04]</a>. A 30-minute Finnish sauna session has been shown to lower heart rate and increase parasympathetic activity (part of HRV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:02">[12:56:02]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Cardiovascular Improvements:** Consistent sauna use improves blood pressure, left ventricular function, vascular compliance, and endothelial function, all of which are also improved by physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:07">[13:47:07]</a>.

### Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

Heat shock proteins are evolutionarily conserved chaperone proteins found in various organisms, including humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>. Heat is one of the most robust ways to increase their expression and activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>.

*   **Function:** HSPs are crucial for maintaining the proper three-dimensional structure of proteins within cells, essential for their function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:01">[17:03:01]</a>. They prevent misfolded proteins from aggregating into plaques, which play a causal role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (amyloid beta), Parkinson's (alpha-synuclein), and Huntington's (Huntington protein) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. Protein aggregates have also been implicated in cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. HSPs prevent and may even help negate existing protein aggregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.
*   **Muscle Atrophy:** HSPs have been shown to slow muscular atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. A recent study showed that people with immobilized legs exposed to heat and increased HSPs had 37% less muscle atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.
*   **Longevity:** HSPs play a role in human longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>. Individuals with two copies of a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the heat shock protein 70 gene, which enhances its function, live, on average, two years longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>. Those with one copy live about one year longer, demonstrating a gene dosage-dependent effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>.
*   **Sauna's Effect on HSPs:** Healthy individuals sitting in a dry sauna at ~163°F for 30 minutes can increase their HSPs by 50%, with levels remaining elevated for about 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>. People acclimated to heat (e.g., frequent sauna users or physically active individuals) can increase HSPs sooner and more robustly upon heat exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.

### Lowering Inflammation

Sauna use can lower inflammatory biomarkers like C-reactive protein in a dose-dependent manner (more frequent, longer duration leads to more robust lowering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>. It also increases anti-inflammatory biomarkers like IL-10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>. These effects are consistent with those observed from physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>.

## Types of Saunas and Usage Recommendations

*   **Finnish Sauna (Wet Sauna):**
    *   Typically 174°F <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.
    *   Water is thrown on hot rocks to create steam, increasing humidity up to 20%, which makes it feel even hotter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
    *   Recommended duration for robust effects is greater than 19 minutes (at least 20 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
    *   Frequency: 2-3 times/week for significant effects, 4-7 times/week for even stronger effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
    *   Finnish saunas heat the ambient air, transferring heat to the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
    *   Personally, Dr. Patrick would choose a Finnish sauna for home use due to its higher heat and more robust effects compared to infrared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>.

*   **Far Infrared (Way On Therapy) Sauna:**
    *   Typically around 140°F, not as hot as Finnish saunas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.
    *   Duration is often longer, around 45 minutes, due to lower temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.
    *   Frequency is higher, often daily, for 2-3 weeks in most studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
    *   Uses thermal radiation to heat the body directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.
    *   Way On Therapy has been used in randomized trials for managing chronic heart failure (improving endurance, heart size, disease status) and coronary artery ischemia (improving vascular endothelial function) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

*   **Other Modalities:** Steam showers and hot baths can also increase core body temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:11:00">[33:11:00]</a>. Hot baths have shown similar profound effects on the endocrine system as saunas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:00">[33:27:00]</a>. For optimal benefit, the body should remain submerged to maintain heat stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[33:42:00]</a>.

## Safety and Contraindications

Sauna use is generally very safe for healthy people and those with stable cardiac disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>.

*   **Rehydration:** It is important to rehydrate after a sauna session, as a person can lose about 0.5 kg of sweat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>.
*   **Acclimation:** Individuals new to sauna use can start with shorter durations (e.g., 5-7 minutes) and gradually increase their time as they acclimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43:00">[30:43:00]</a>.
*   **Contraindications:**
    *   **Alcohol:** Never consume alcohol before or during sauna use, as it can be dangerous and has been linked to deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Low Blood Pressure:** Elderly individuals prone to low blood pressure should be cautious, as saunas significantly lower blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Cardiac Conditions:** Recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, and severe aortic stenosis are considered contraindications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Children:** Children can use saunas, but for much shorter durations (e.g., 5 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a>. More specific guidelines for special populations (elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with various heart conditions) can be found on Dr. Patrick's website, *foundmyfitness.com* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.

## [[Combining sauna use with exercise for health benefits | Sauna Use and Other Health Practices]]

*   **[[Benefits of sauna combined with exercise | Sauna and Exercise]]:** There is an additive effect when combining physical activity with sauna use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:45:00">[27:45:00]</a>. For instance, improvements in mitochondrial function in muscle tissue are enhanced in physically active individuals compared to sedentary ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:55:00">[27:55:00]</a>.
*   **[[Sauna use and depression | Mood Enhancement]]:** Sauna use increases endorphins, similar to physical activity, leading to a mood-enhancing effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>. A randomized controlled trial showed that a single elevation of core body temperature by 1-2 degrees in people with major depression had an antidepressant effect lasting for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:00">[23:14:00]</a>.
*   **Detoxification:** Certain heavy metals, such as cadmium and mercury, are excreted more effectively through sweat than through urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>.
*   **Patient Compliance:** Sauna use is often easier for sedentary individuals to adopt than physical activity, as it is perceived as a "spa treatment" while providing similar benefits to moderate aerobic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>.
*   **Other Health Span Tools:** Other key tools for improving health span include time-restricted eating (eating all food within a 6-11 hour window daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:39:00">[35:39:00]</a>, and prolonged fasting (e.g., at least 48 hours, or using fasting-mimicking diets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27:00">[39:27:00]</a>. Fasting activates stress response pathways that help clear cellular debris, dysfunctional organelles like mitochondria, and rejuvenate cells, potentially replacing damaged old cells with healthy new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:30:00">[37:30:00]</a>. Broccoli sprouts are also mentioned as an important way to improve health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:18:00">[41:18:00]</a>.

[[Cardiovascular_disease_and_prevention | Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease]] (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death globally for both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. A sobering statistic reveals that for nearly 50% of individuals, their first symptom of coronary artery disease is sudden death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:10">[07:07:10]</a>. While cancer and neurodegenerative diseases are complex, ASCVD is the disease for which medical science has the clearest understanding of its initiation and propagation, offering the most tools for prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

## Understanding Cholesterol and Lipoproteins

[[The_relationship_between_cholesterol_and_heart_disease | Cholesterol]] is an essential molecule for life, vital for cellular fluidity and as a precursor to critical hormones like testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:40">[08:34:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Every cell in the body, except red blood cells, produces cholesterol, with the liver and steroidal tissues being major contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

To transport fat-soluble cholesterol through the water-based blood, it must be encapsulated in water-soluble particles called lipoproteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. The key protein on the surface of these spheres is called an apolipoprotein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

### The Role of ApoB

There are two broad classes of apolipoproteins: A and B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. ApoB (specifically ApoB-100) is the structural apoprotein found on low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. All of these ApoB-containing particles are capable of initiating and propagating [[atherogenic_dyslipidemia_and_its_implications | atherosclerosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>, which is the plaque formation inside coronary arteries that reduces blood flow to the heart muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Risk Prediction

The understanding of [[the_relationship_between_cholesterol_and_heart_disease | heart disease risk prediction]] has evolved significantly:

*   **Total Cholesterol**: In the 1950s, only total cholesterol could be measured. While very high total cholesterol was loosely correlated with [[cardiovascular_disease_and_prevention | cardiovascular disease]] outcomes, it was only at extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:13]</a>. Total cholesterol includes the cholesterol contained within HDLs, LDLs, and VLDLs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:15]</a>.
*   **[[ldl_cholesterol_and_its_particle_sizes | LDL Cholesterol (LDL-C)]]**: Later, LDL-C, the cholesterol within low-density lipoproteins, was found to be much more strongly associated with risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:05]</a>. Many labs still estimate LDL-C using the Friedewald equation (Total Cholesterol - HDL Cholesterol - (Triglyceride/5)), which can often be inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:03]</a>.
*   **LDL Particle Number (LDL-P)**: Studies like the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Framingham Offspring population have unequivocally shown that LDL-P predicts risk better than LDL-C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:06]</a>. LDL-P can be measured using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or ion motility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:03]</a>.
*   **ApoB: The Superior Metric**: The concentration of ApoB particles is considered an even better predictor of risk than LDL-P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:16]</a>. ApoB encompasses the total [[atherogenic_dyslipidemia_and_its_implications | atherogenic burden]] because there is one ApoB molecule per atherogenic lipoprotein particle (LDL, IDL, VLDL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:47]</a>. This means ApoB accounts for all particles capable of causing atherosclerosis, including those with elevated VLDL that might be missed by LDL-P or LDL-C measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:09]</a>.

## Causality and Management of ApoB

ApoB is not merely associated with [[cardiovascular_disease_and_prevention | cardiovascular disease]]; it is causally linked to it, meaning it directly *causes* ASCVD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:21]</a>. This understanding shifts the approach from managing "10-year risk" percentiles to a strategy of elimination, similar to how smoking is treated as a causal factor for lung cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:00">[24:33:14]</a>.

Atherosclerosis is a disease that takes decades to progress, often beginning at birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08:00">[26:08:10]</a>. Therefore, minimizing the "area under the curve" of ApoB exposure over a lifetime is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:51:00">[34:51:00]</a>.

Physiologic levels of ApoB (and LDL-C) in children are typically very low, around 10 to 30 mg/dL, with no negative consequences, even during periods of high growth and cholesterol demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:02:00">[33:02:00]</a>. Levels tend to rise in teenagers and 20s, primarily due to a reduction in clearance rather than an increased need for LDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:20:00">[33:20:00]</a>.

Experts suggest that maintaining an ApoB level below 20-30 mg/dL would make it impossible to develop atherosclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:49:00">[33:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:00">[34:01:00]</a>. A lifetime ceiling of 60 mg/dL would also be considered very low risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:27:00">[35:27:00]</a>. However, achieving such low levels often requires pharmacologic intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:25:00">[34:25:00]</a>.

## Factors Influencing ApoB

ApoB levels are influenced by:
1.  **Cholesterol Synthesis**: Affected by dietary choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>.
2.  **Cholesterol Reabsorption**: Part of the cholesterol lifecycle involves reabsorption from bile in the gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Triglyceride Burden**: Higher triglyceride levels lead to higher ApoB. This is closely linked to insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a>.
4.  **Clearance Rate**: Primarily dependent on the function and number of LDL receptors on the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_cholesterol_and_heart_health | Impact of Diet and Lifestyle on ApoB]]

*   **Insulin Resistance**: Dietary patterns contributing to insulin resistance, particularly those high in refined and starchy carbohydrates, increase triglyceride burden and thus ApoB levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:50:00">[37:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>. Lowering triglycerides through carbohydrate restriction is highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>.
*   **Saturated Fat Consumption**: Saturated fat directly impacts cholesterol synthesis and can inhibit the production of LDL receptors in the liver, leading to higher ApoB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:16:00">[40:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[41:10:00]</a>. The susceptibility to this effect varies individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:32:00">[41:32:00]</a>. For some, substituting saturated fats with monounsaturated fats can resolve elevated ApoB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:05:00">[43:05:00]</a>.
*   **Dietary Strategy**: Nutrition should primarily focus on energy balance and protein intake, rather than solely on lowering lipids. If dietary choices lead to elevated lipids, pharmacologic tools should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:10:00">[45:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>.

## [[role_of_ldl_and_statins_in_managing_heart_disease_risk | Pharmacological Interventions for ApoB]]

ApoB and LDL-C levels are highly genetic, which has allowed for Mendelian randomization studies to confirm their causal link to ASCVD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:40:00">[46:40:00]</a>. Lower lifelong exposure to ApoB/LDL predicts lower ASCVD risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:47:00">[47:47:00]</a>.

Key pharmacological strategies to lower ApoB include:

*   **Statins**: These drugs inhibit the first committed step of cholesterol synthesis, primarily in the liver. This action causes the liver to produce more LDL receptors, which in turn pull more LDL from circulation, lowering LDL and ApoB levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:58:00">[56:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:37:00">[57:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Side Effects**: Approximately 7% of people on statins develop muscle aches, which are reversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:04:00">[58:04:00]</a>. A small subset (around 4%) may develop type 2 diabetes due to increased insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:26:00">[58:26:00]</a>. Monitoring glucose levels (e.g., with a CGM) is important to detect early insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:46:00">[58:46:00]</a>. Statins can also increase liver transaminases, indicating inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:38:00">[59:38:00]</a>.
    *   **Mitochondrial Function**: Statins inhibit the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, which is also involved in CoQ10 synthesis, a vital component for mitochondrial function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. However, the impact on mitochondrial function (measured by Zone 2 lactate testing) appears to be very small, if any <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. CoQ10 supplementation has not consistently shown to reduce muscle soreness from statins in trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Neurodegenerative Disease**: No study has directly investigated statins and Alzheimer's disease or dementia as a primary outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>. Secondary outcome data from studies primarily focused on ASCVD have shown a neutral to beneficial effect of statins on dementia and Alzheimer's incidence, with no difference between hydrophobic and hydrophilic statins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Desmosterol Levels**: Desmosterol is a proxy for brain cholesterol synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>. Very low desmosterol levels have been associated with increased Alzheimer's disease risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. In patients with [[role_of_apoe4_in_alzheimers_disease | ApoE4]] genes or a family history of Alzheimer's, statins may be avoided if desmosterol levels fall below a certain threshold (<0.8 mg/dL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Ezetimibe (Zetia)**: This drug increases LDL receptors on the liver by impairing cholesterol reabsorption in the gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. It blocks the Neiman-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) transporter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. It is less potent than statins but can be highly effective in individuals with defective ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, indicated by very high phytosterol (e.g., sitosterol, campesterol) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **PCSK9 Inhibitors**: These are highly effective and safe drugs that work by preventing the breakdown of LDL receptors, thus increasing their number on the liver surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This discovery stemmed from observing individuals with hypofunctioning PCSK9 genes who have very low LDL-C/ApoB levels and do not develop [[cardiovascular_disease_and_prevention | cardiovascular disease]] or other diseases like cancer or neurodegenerative conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. They are expensive and often not covered by insurance unless specific high-risk criteria are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Bempedoic Acid**: This prodrug works similarly to statins by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, but its action is confined to the liver, avoiding systemic side effects like muscle aches or insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. It is also an expensive drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **Berberine**: A systematic review published around 2022 suggested that berberine may be beneficial in lowering LDL-C and possibly LDL-P, both alone and in conjunction with statins. It may also help lower side effects of statin myopathy and reduce the effective statin dose needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Berberine is a complex I inhibitor, similar to metformin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

## Measuring Atherosclerosis

While biomarkers like ApoB are crucial, direct imaging of plaque accumulation can provide a more complete picture.
*   **CT Angiogram (CTA)**: This is considered the best way to visualize plaque accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. A CTA is most helpful when it yields a positive finding in a young person or a negative finding in an older person, as these outcomes can significantly alter treatment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. CTA radiation exposure has significantly decreased over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

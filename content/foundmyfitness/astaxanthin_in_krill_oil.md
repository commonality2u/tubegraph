Krill oil contains astaxanthin, a unique antioxidant not found in fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This carotenoid plays a significant role in protecting cells and is easily absorbed by the human bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## Properties of Astaxanthin

Astaxanthin is a carotenoid that exhibits several key properties:
*   It sequesters singlet oxygen, which is produced by UV radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   It acts as a potent antioxidant against peroxy radicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   It possesses an amphipathic structure, meaning it has both fat-soluble and water-soluble portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This allows it to accumulate in cell membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   Unlike other antioxidants like glutathione, which are produced in the soluble portion of the cell, astaxanthin can accumulate in cell membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Role in Protecting Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Astaxanthin's ability to accumulate in cell membranes is beneficial because DHA, which is highly prone to oxidation, also accumulates in cell membranes where it plays an important role in cell membrane fluidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Supplementing astaxanthin alongside [[Importance of Omega3 fatty acids for health | omega-3 fatty acids]] may help protect DHA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (which are prone to oxidation) that accumulate in cell membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Singlet oxygen and peroxy radicals are harmful, as they damage DNA, lipids, and proteins within cells, contributing to diseases of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Clinical trials have shown that astaxanthin supplementation can:
*   Lower inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   Decrease DNA damage, including oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Increase HDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

These mechanisms are relevant in combating degenerative diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Krill oil's inclusion of astaxanthin provides an added bonus in fighting off diseases of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

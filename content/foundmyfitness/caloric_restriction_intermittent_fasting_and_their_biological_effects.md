Dr. David Sinclair, a professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, conducts research to understand the biological mechanisms that regulate the aging process and how to slow them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His work, spanning over 30 years, has contributed to a breakthrough in understanding why we age and how it might be reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Longevity Genes and Their Activation

In the 1980s and early 1990s, a significant discovery was made: there are genes that control aging, termed "longevity genes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These genes, found initially in organisms like nematode worms and yeast cells, are present in nearly every life form on Earth, including humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

These longevity genes are triggered by activities such as running or [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. When activated, they prompt the body to repair itself, thereby slowing the aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The focus is on increasing longevity and [[caloric_restriction_and_healthspan | healthspan]], rather than "anti-aging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Dr. Rhonda Patrick recounts her early experience at the Salk Institute, where she observed nematode worms with a decreased insulin IGF-1 signaling pathway living 100% longer and remaining youthful beyond their normal lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This direct observation sparked her interest in the genetic aspects of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Sirtuins and Calorie Restriction

A key breakthrough in aging research involved sirtuins. The discovery of a gene called SIR4, which, when mutated, extended the lifespan of yeast cells, led to understanding that SIR proteins (enzymes controlling gene expression) become dysregulated over time due to accumulating DNA instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Crucially, sirtuin enzymes that regulate genes were found to also control lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Adding an extra copy of the SIR2 gene into yeast extended their lifespan by 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This effect was later shown to mimic [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. When sirtuins are abundant, the body benefits from [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] or other mild cellular stressors like heat and amino acid deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Conversely, removing the SIR2 gene eliminates the benefits of [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This concept formed the basis for much of the subsequent research in the sirtuin field in mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Defining Calorie Restriction
Historically, [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] in mice involved reducing food intake by 30-40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. In yeast, [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] was achieved by a fivefold reduction in sugar levels in the Petri dish, which extended lifespan while still allowing for happy growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## [[Intermittent fasting | Intermittent Fasting]]

Modern approaches like [[Intermittent fasting | intermittent fasting]] can activate these longevity genes (sirtuins) without requiring constant hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. One can eat for four or six days a week and still achieve beneficial sirtuin activity through periods of [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

There is significant scientific overlap between [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] and [[Intermittent fasting | intermittent fasting]] in their beneficial health effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. A key difference with [[Intermittent fasting | intermittent fasting]] is the metabolic shift from carbohydrate (glucose) to fatty acid metabolism, potentially leading to [[Intermittent fasting and ketosis | ketogenesis]] during prolonged fasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

In 2005, Dr. Sinclair's lab demonstrated that [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] in rats significantly increased levels of sirtuin gene number one (SIRT1) in organs like the liver and muscle (five to tenfold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This effect was replicated in vitro by growing cells in serum from [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie-restricted]] animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The mechanism was linked to low insulin and IGF-1 levels, as reintroducing normal insulin and IGF-1 levels reduced sirtuin production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This finding established a crucial link between sirtuins, [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]], and the insulin pathway in mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

It is now understood that various longevity pathways, including sirtuins, AMP kinase (metformin pathway), and mTOR (rapamycin pathway), interact within a complex network, rather than operating independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Tweaking one pathway can positively influence others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## NAD and Sirtuins

The sirtuin pathway is regulated by NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide plus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. NAD levels rise during [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> and in response to exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. NAD levels fluctuate based on diet, exercise, and circadian rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. It is believed that NAD cycles being "out of whack" contribute to jet lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Interestingly, NAD appears to drive the circadian clock, rather than being driven by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

NAD is vital for metabolism, including glucose and fatty acid metabolism, and is required by mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. It also activates sirtuins and DNA repair enzymes like PARP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. NAD, along with ATP and amino acids, acts as a crucial sensing molecule in the body, signaling environmental conditions and influencing whether cells "hunker down and survive" or "go forth and multiply" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. These pathways (sirtuins, AMP kinase, mTOR) are ancient, existing for over 3 billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

NAD levels decrease with age; Dr. Sinclair's levels are half what they were at age 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This decline leads to sirtuins working less effectively, impairing the body's repair mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Raising NAD levels to youthful concentrations can "trick" the body into thinking it's young, exercising, or dieting, allowing sirtuins to function optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

### NAD Boosters
NAD is a large molecule not easily absorbed directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. Instead, precursors like nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR) are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. NMN is the immediate precursor to NAD, converted in one step inside the cell by an enzyme called NAMPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. This enzyme increases under stress and [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. NR is a smaller version of NMN that must first have a phosphate added before conversion to NMN and then NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. Both NR and NMN have been shown to raise NAD levels in animals and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.

> [!warning] Storing NAD Boosters
> NMN and NR are not very stable and degrade over time, especially if not kept cool and dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. Degradation can turn them into nicotinamide, which can inhibit sirtuins and PARP, interfering with DNA repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.

## Resveratrol and Hormesis

Resveratrol, a molecule found in stressed plants like grapes, acts as an "accelerator pedal" for sirtuins, making them work even faster when combined with NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This phenomenon, where ingesting molecules from stressed plants benefits our bodies, is called xenohormesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. The body senses the plant's stress, prompting it to become fitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

The concept of hormesis suggests that mild stress on the body helps activate defense mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>. Conversely, a lifestyle of constant satiety and inactivity keeps these beneficial pathways dormant, prioritizing tissue growth over long-term bodily sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

Resveratrol research, particularly in animals, shows promising effects. In a study with rhesus monkeys, resveratrol completely ameliorated the 40% increased aortic stiffness caused by a high-sucrose, high-fat diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. This effect was achieved with doses that are feasible for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. Resveratrol is believed to work through multiple mechanisms, including SIRT1's anti-inflammatory actions in endothelial cells, DNA repair, and dampening macrophage infiltration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. It also reduced oxidative stress in arteries of treated mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

Dr. Sinclair personally takes about a gram of trans-resveratrol daily with a bit of fat to enhance absorption and keeps it in the dark and cold due to its light sensitivity and insolubility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. He also takes a gram of NMN every morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.

## Epigenetic Clock and Its Reversal

The epigenetic clock, as described by Steve Horvath, tracks biological age through DNA methylation patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. This clock is intimately linked to the movement of sirtuins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. While [[Intermittent fasting | fasting]] can slow the rate of this clock, it has not yet been shown to reverse it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

Researchers are working on "epigenetic resetting" using modified Yamanaka factors to reverse the epigenetic clock and potentially restore cellular identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. This process aims to direct proteins that have "lost their way" back to their youthful positions on the genome, resetting methylation marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. Early animal studies show promising results in restoring eyesight and regrowing optic nerves in old mice without apparent downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. This represents a potentially "radically new" approach to age reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

> [!info] The Information Theory of Aging
> Dr. Sinclair's "information theory of aging" posits that aging is fundamentally a loss of information regulation over time, akin to analog signals degrading with noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>. The genome is the digital information, while the epigenome is its analog reader, prone to degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. The goal of age reversal is to retrieve this lost information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

## Sleep and Metabolic Health

Fragmented or insufficient sleep can significantly impact metabolic health. Dr. Rhonda Patrick noted that during periods of fragmented sleep due to her son's teething, her fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels increased by 15 to 20 units, despite a consistent diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. This observation underscored the profound effect sleep deprivation has on insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>. In rats, sleep deprivation can lead to diabetes within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>. Both Dr. Patrick and Dr. Sinclair noted visible signs of accelerated aging during periods of sleep deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a molecule that has become highly relevant to the field of [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | aging]] in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is considered one of the most important molecules on the planet, essential for life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## NAD Decline with Age

A critical aspect of [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD's role in aging]] is that its levels naturally decrease with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This reduction in NAD levels across various tissues is associated with many hallmarks of [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Hallmarks of Aging Associated with NAD Decline
The hallmarks of [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | aging]] linked to decreased NAD include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>:
*   Loss of proteostasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_aging | Mitochondrial dysfunction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   Glucose intolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Insulin insensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Cellular senescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   Altered epigenetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

This decline means that tissues, such as the brain, immune cells, and muscle tissue, do not function properly as they did during youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Reasons for NAD Decline
While the complete answer to why NAD levels decrease with age is still an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, known factors include:
*   **Increased Consumption**: Chronic [[inflammation_and_agerelated_diseases | inflammation]] and immune activation, which consume NAD, tend to rise with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This places immense demand on the NAD pool, partly due to the increased need for DNA repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Decreased Production and Recycling**: The body's ability to produce and recycle NAD also declines with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Increased DNA damage and [[inflammation_and_agerelated_diseases | inflammation]] seen in [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | aging]] may decrease NAD and potentiate [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## How NAD Impacts Cellular Function and Aging

NAD plays a crucial [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | role in energy metabolism]] and acts as a cofactor for many important enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Energy Metabolism
NAD is essential for energy production in every tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It participates in redox reactions (alternating conversions between its oxidized form, NAD+, and reduced form, NADH) which are crucial for the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids, and the formation of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Many NAD-required enzymes are inside the mitochondria, contributing to energy generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. NAD also acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in glucose energy production outside the mitochondria, a process called glycolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### DNA Repair
NAD plays a very important [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | role in mitigating DNA damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It is a cofactor for PARP1, one of the most important enzymes involved in repairing DNA damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Excessive DNA damage and subsequent PARP1 activation can significantly decrease NAD levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The ability to repair DNA damage is critical for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Studies show that centenarians (100 years or older) have significantly higher PARP1 activity than younger individuals, and PARP1 activity correlates with maximum lifespan in mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Sirtuin Activation
NAD is required to activate sirtuins, a family of enzymes involved in longevity and healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Sirtuins regulate various metabolic processes, stress response, and lifespan modulation through epigenetic regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. They use NAD to remove acetyl groups from cellular proteins, controlling the activation of genes involved in [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | energy metabolism]], autophagy, circadian rhythm, DNA repair, and cell survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. When cellular energy levels are low (e.g., during [[role_of_exercise_in_preventing_agerelated_diseases | exercise]], fasting, or caloric restriction), NAD levels and the NAD:NADH ratio increase, which activates sirtuins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Consequences of NAD Depletion on Age-Related Diseases

NAD depletion has been associated with hallmarks of [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | aging]] such as decreased autophagy, increased DNA damage, increased [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_aging | mitochondrial dysfunction]], and dysregulated metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This depletion may predispose organisms to the development of various [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | age-related diseases]], including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>:
*   Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>
*   Cardiovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>
*   Muscle atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>

It may also increase susceptibility to infections, as the immune system requires significant amounts of NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Boosting NAD Levels

Increasing NAD levels has become a major focus in [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | aging]] research.

### Lifestyle Interventions
NAD levels are significantly influenced by lifestyle factors, particularly those that cause energy stress, which can raise NAD levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>:
*   [[role_of_exercise_in_preventing_agerelated_diseases | Exercise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>
*   Fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>
*   Caloric restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

### Dietary Sources and Recycling
NAD can be synthesized from dietary sources such as the amino acid tryptophan (found in salmon, spinach, nuts) and the three forms of niacin (vitamin B3), including nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide riboside (found in lean meats, legumes, veggies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. However, dietary sources are not the major source of NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The body's demand for NAD is so large that it relies primarily on a recycling mechanism called the NAD salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

In this pathway, the consumption of NAD by enzymes generates nicotinamide as a by-product, which is then converted into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and subsequently into NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. An important consideration is that nicotinamide has been shown to inhibit sirtuin activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, and the enzyme converting nicotinamide to NMN is subject to feedback inhibition by NAD levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### NAD Boosting Supplements
Nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) are often referred to as NAD boosters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These precursors can be found as consumer-available supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

#### Animal Studies on NAD Boosters
In animal studies, NR and NMN have shown promising results in improving the [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | aging]] process of multiple tissues and cell types at very high doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These include the heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and stem cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

*   **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)**:
    *   Counteracted an obesogenic diet by improving insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
    *   Improved endurance and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
    *   Reversed [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_aging | mitochondrial damage]], increased mitochondrial biogenesis, and reversed muscular atrophy in animals with severe muscle wasting disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
    *   Had positive effects on the brain, increasing neurogenesis, decreasing cognitive deterioration and amyloid beta production, and increasing synaptic plasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

*   **Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)**:
    *   Counteracted an obesogenic diet and improved metabolic health markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    *   Improved heart function in animals with heart problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
    *   Improved cognition and memory in animals with neurodegenerative disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
    *   A long-term study found that dietary NMN mitigated age-associated physiological decline in mice with accelerated [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | aging]] phenotype, improving skeletal muscle function, [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_aging | mitochondrial function]], energy expenditure, bone density, and decreasing insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. These benefits were dose-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

#### Potential Risks and Benefits of NAD Boosting Supplements: Cancer Concern
One significant concern raised by animal studies is NMN's effect on cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. In a recent study, NMN accelerated cancer growth in mice with a type of pancreatic cancer where pro-inflammatory senescent cells drive tumor growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. NAD appears to increase the tumorigenic quality of senescent cells, likely by enhancing their energy metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. While this specific context does not mean NR or NMN supplementation will cause or drive tumor progression in other cancer types, long-term animal studies are needed to confirm safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

#### Dosage and Bioavailability in Animals vs. Humans
Most rodent studies used very high doses of NR (e.g., 400 mg/kg body weight orally), which translates to a human equivalent dose of approximately 2.6 grams per day for a 180-pound person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Similarly, NMN studies often used high doses (e.g., 500 mg/kg body weight, typically injected) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. The oral dose for NMN in the long-term [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | aging]] study ranged from 100 mg/kg to 300 mg/kg body weight, translating to about 653 mg to 2 grams per day for a 180-pound person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

Isotope tracer studies in animals found that at lower oral doses (e.g., 50 mg/kg), NR and NMN produced very low levels of directly formed NAD, primarily in the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. At higher oral doses, more NAD derived from the salvage pathway was found in kidney, muscle, and brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. When administered intravenously, NR and NMN directly produced NAD in liver, kidney, and muscle in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. However, NAD detected in the brain was only that which was salvaged from nicotinamide, suggesting that neither NR nor NMN directly cross the blood-brain barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

Direct injection of NAD has shown promise in raising NAD levels in some brain regions and the heart in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>, but there is little preclinical and no clinical data on direct IV injection of NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

#### Human Studies on NAD Boosters
As of the transcript, there is no published evidence of oral NMN supplementation in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. However, two randomized placebo-controlled trials have shown that oral NR can increase NAD levels in white blood cells in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>:
*   An 8-week study with 120 healthy adults (60-80 years old) showed that 250 mg daily of NR combined with pterostilbene (a sirtuin activator) increased whole blood NAD levels by 40% after four weeks, and 90% at 500 mg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. The lower dose also reduced diastolic blood pressure and liver enzyme levels, though it's unclear if NR, pterostilbene, or both were responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   Another trial with 60 middle-aged and older adults (55-79 years old) found that 500 mg of NR twice daily (1 gram total) for six weeks was well-tolerated and increased NAD levels in white blood cells by 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. While participants experienced improvements in blood pressure and aortic stiffness, these were not statistically significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. NR had no statistically significant effects on metabolic function, motor function, or [[role_of_exercise_in_preventing_agerelated_diseases | exercise]] capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

The highest dose tested in human studies was 1 gram per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>, which is significantly lower than the human equivalent doses showing benefits in animal studies (e.g., 2.6 grams per day for NR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. While short-term clinical studies indicate oral NR is safe, no long-term studies have been conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. NR and NMN can break down into nicotinamide over time, especially in high humidity or heat, which may reduce [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | sirtuin activation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Keeping these supplements cold can help maintain their stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

## Conclusion

NAD is crucial for survival, [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | energy metabolism]], DNA repair, and [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | sirtuin activation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Its decline with normal [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | aging]] leads to metabolic and [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_aging | mitochondrial dysfunction]], increased DNA damage, and other problems associated with [[understanding_aging_as_a_disease | aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. While lifestyle factors like [[role_of_exercise_in_preventing_agerelated_diseases | exercise]] and fasting can increase NAD, the data on NAD boosters like NR and NMN largely comes from animal studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. Whether these boosters are effective and safe in humans in the long term remains an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. More research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn about their widespread use for [[role_of_micronutrients_in_preventing_agerelated_diseases | preventing age-related diseases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.

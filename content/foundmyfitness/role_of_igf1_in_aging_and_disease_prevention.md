## Overview of IGF-1
Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) plays a significant role in the [[role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_aging | aging]] process and disease development. It is a growth signal that is highly regulated by dietary factors, particularly protein and certain amino acids like methionine and cysteine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Along with [[igf1_and_mtor_pathways_in_cancer_and_aging | mTOR]], IGF-1 is part of the nutrient-sensing pathways that are impacted by calorie restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## IGF-1 and Longevity
Research indicates that IGF-1, or its orthologs in simpler organisms, significantly influences [[the_role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_aging | aging]] in both simple organisms and mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. It is considered one of the axes that regulates or accelerates [[the_role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_aging | aging]] across multiple cell types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Animal Studies
Mice with a deficiency in the growth hormone receptor or growth hormone itself live approximately 40% longer and are substantially healthier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Many of these mice reach the end of their lives without developing obvious pathological lesions or diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This longevity and healthspan benefit is attributed to the resulting low levels of growth hormone and consequently low [[igf1_and_mtor_pathways_in_cancer_and_aging | IGF-1]], insulin, and [[igf1_and_mtor_pathways_in_cancer_and_aging | TOR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

### Human Evidence
Studies on humans with a specific mutation in the growth hormone receptor, known as Laron's syndrome, mirror the findings in mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. These individuals, found in Ecuador, have extremely low circulating IGF-1 levels (around 10% of normal) and low insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. While their lifespan may only be a few years longer than their relatives, they are significantly protected from [[igf1_and_mtor_pathways_in_cancer_and_aging | cancer]], diabetes, and age-dependent cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This protection is consistent with the mouse data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

## IGF-1 in Disease Prevention
Low IGF-1 signaling is linked to protection against several age-related diseases.
*   **[[igf1_and_mtor_pathways_in_cancer_and_aging | Cancer]]**: Both animal and human studies indicate that lower IGF-1 levels are protective against [[igf1_and_mtor_pathways_in_cancer_and_aging | cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Serum from individuals with Laron's syndrome, which has very low IGF-1, down-regulates [[igf1_and_mtor_pathways_in_cancer_and_aging | TOR]] and Ras expression, and other genes associated with accelerated [[the_role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_aging | aging]] and [[igf1_and_mtor_pathways_in_cancer_and_aging | cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Diabetes**: Similarly, low IGF-1 is associated with protection from diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Decline**: Laron's syndrome patients also appear protected from age-dependent cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Autoimmune Diseases**: Emerging research suggests that lowering IGF-1 through fasting or a fasting-mimicking diet may be applicable to many [[role_of_inflammation_in_aging_and_disease | autoimmune diseases]] by promoting the clearing of damaged cells and activating healthy stem cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.

## Dietary Regulation of IGF-1
The impact of diet on IGF-1 levels is critical for modulating [[the_role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_aging | aging]] and disease risk.
*   **Caloric Restriction**: Chronic calorie reduction can affect IGF-1 levels, typically lowering them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. However, some human studies showed that if the calorie-restricted diet was high in animal protein, IGF-1 levels remained normal, suggesting protein intake is a key regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. IGF-1 levels only decreased when protein intake was also restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Protein and Sugar**: Protein intake, specifically certain amino acids, is a primary dietary regulator of the IGF-1 pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Sugar levels, particularly glucose, also activate pathways like PKA, which is linked to IGF-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. The interplay between sugar and protein in regulating IGF-1 and other pathways is complex, with sugar potentially dominating in simpler organisms like yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
*   **Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD)**: The fasting-mimicking diet was designed to mimic the effects of water-only fasting on key biomarkers, including IGF-1, IGFBP-1, ketone bodies, and glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. Clinical trials in healthy subjects demonstrated that FMD cycles effectively decrease elevated IGF-1 levels, especially in individuals who previously had high levels, suggesting a "resetting" effect on the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.

## Interplay with Other Pathways
IGF-1 signaling is interconnected with other crucial pathways:
*   **Growth Hormone (GH)**: GH and the growth hormone receptor are considered master controllers, with IGF-1 as one of the axes they regulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Insulin**: Insulin and IGF-1 are structurally similar and can interchangeably bind to each other's receptors, although with different affinities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Both are linked to growth hormone signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **[[igf1_and_mtor_pathways_in_cancer_and_aging | mTOR]] and PKA**: Nutrient-signaling pathways, including [[igf1_and_mtor_pathways_in_cancer_and_aging | TOR]] (mTOR) and PKA, are affected by IGF-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. PKA is thought to be central, handling both protein and sugar signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

## Clinical Measurement and Significance
For individuals interested in monitoring their [[the_role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_aging | aging]] biomarkers, IGF-1 is considered one of the key markers, alongside insulin, glucose, [[role_of_inflammation_in_aging_and_disease | systemic inflammation]] (CRP), triglycerides, fatty liver, and blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. These markers, when in an ideal range, are indicative of healthy [[the_role_of_diet_and_nutrition_in_aging | aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.

Dr. Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology and Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California and Director of the Longevity Institute, has significantly contributed to the field of aging, focusing on the [[effects of diet on aging | effects of fasting]] and other [[different fasting methods and their effects | diets]] on human aging, lifespan, and biomarkers of health span <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. His work also explores [[fasting and metabolic health | metabolic fasting therapies]] for human diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Fasting-Mimicking Diets (FMD)

Longo's research primarily focuses on periodic fasting, and more specifically, [[fastingmimicking diet and longevity | fasting-mimicking diets]] (FMDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These diets are designed to "trick the system" into thinking it is fasting, even while consuming food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The concept emerged from an effort to provide a more accessible alternative to permanent [[calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Fasting vs. Calorie Restriction

[[Calorie restriction intermittent fasting and their biological effects | Calorie restriction]] (CR), often involving a 20-30% reduction in daily calories, allows continuous eating of fewer calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. In contrast, [[caloric_restriction_intermittent_fasting_and_their_biological_effects | fasting and periodic fasting]] are more extreme interventions designed to orchestrate specific genetic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Many biological effects, such as increased protection and stem cell activation, are not achievable through CR alone but require these more extreme interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

A key difference is the "refeeding" component of fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While the restriction phase initiates processes like stem cell activation, it is the refeeding phase that drives the rebuilding of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. CR lacks this refeeding cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Impact on the Immune System and Regeneration

Fasting can lead to powerful regeneration programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
In animal studies, prolonged fasting (e.g., 48-72 hours) causes a decrease in white blood cell populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This reduction is primarily due to apoptosis (program cell death), rather than autophagy, to eliminate unnecessary cells during starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. For instance, in mice, about 40% of white blood cells are destroyed during four days of fasting, and this 40% is rebuilt within a few days of refeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This process of shrinking and then regenerating organs like the liver, immune system, heart, and lungs is considered the most powerful regenerative program since birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Rejuvenation of the Immune System in Older Animals

In older mice, fasting was shown to restore lymphocyte numbers closer to youthful levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The ratio of myeloid cells to lymphocytes also shifts towards a more youthful profile, indicating a "rejuvenation of the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This has significant implications for human aging, particularly regarding immunosenescence, where the lymphoid cell population decreases with age, increasing susceptibility to infections and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Fasting and Inflammation

Inflammation is a consistent biomarker associated with healthy aging, with lower inflammation predicting vitality and cognitive function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Valter Longo views inflammation as a consequence of aging and dysregulation of immune and other body cells, rather than a primary driver of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Markers like C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6 should decrease with effective interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

FMD has been shown to decrease inflammation. Mice on FMD from middle age exhibited reduced inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. In human studies (aged 20-70), individuals with high C-reactive protein levels saw them return to normal after three cycles of FMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This suggests that FMD helps reset systems to a more youthful state, regenerating bone marrow and potentially clearing problematic cells in organs like the spleen, leading to fewer inflammatory markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## Fasting and Cancer

Longo's team developed the FMD to overcome the difficulties and safety concerns of prolonged water-only fasting for cancer patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Providing patients with pre-packaged "medicine-like" food boxes significantly improved compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

### Differential Stress Resistance and Sensitization

Fasting and FMD induce two key phenomena in the context of cancer treatment:
1.  **Differential Stress Resistance (DSR):** Normal cells enter a protective, shielded mode when starved, becoming more resistant to various stressors, including chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. This is an evolved starvation response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
2.  **Differential Stress Sensitization (DSS):** Cancer cells, by definition, cannot properly respond to starvation due to their oncogenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. They evolve in a high-nourishment environment (rich in proteins, amino acids, sugars, growth factors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. When these nutrients are removed, cancer cells are "miserable" and become desperate, making them highly susceptible to chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. This "desperation" can lead to suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.

This dual effect means that fasting protects normal cells while making cancer cells more vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. In mice, combining starvation/FMD with chemotherapy significantly increases cancer-free survival, a result rarely seen with either intervention alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. This highlights the power of combining traditional and scientifically-backed integrative medicine approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

### Metabolic Shift and Immune Response in Cancer

Fasting lowers glucose levels, forcing cancer cells, which predominantly use glucose (the Warburg effect), to rely on oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondria for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. This reliance on mitochondria, which produce reactive oxygen species, coupled with the cancer cells' inability to protect themselves, leads to cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. This metabolic shift also makes cancer cells more immunogenic, making them easier for the immune system, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes, to recognize and kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

## Fasting and Multiple Sclerosis

FMD has shown promise in treating autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.
In mouse models of MS, FMD:
*   Destroys autoimmune white blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
*   Activates [[Fasting and stem cell regeneration | stem cells]] to produce new, non-autoimmune immune cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
*   Reduces inflammation around the spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   Allows progenitor cells to rebuild myelin in the spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>.
This coordinated effect leads to regeneration and rebuilding of the damaged system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.

In a human clinical study, a single cycle of a 7-day FMD followed by a Mediterranean diet showed better results over six months than a continuous ketogenic diet for MS patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

## Personal Practice and Recommendations

Valter Longo personally practices [[different fasting methods and their effects | intermittent fasting]] by not eating lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. He advocates for a flexible approach to nutrition, adapting meal frequency based on weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. For those overweight or prone to weight gain, a two-meal-a-day program (breakfast and lunch or dinner) within a 12-hour or less time window is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. For underweight individuals, three meals a day are appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. This approach helps control visceral fat and overall weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>. The goal is to optimize longevity while maintaining happiness and compliance, as rigid [[calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | diets]] are rarely sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

## Metabolic and Physical Adaptations

FMD pushes the body into a ketogenic mode by day two, burning visceral fat as the primary energy source and shifting the brain from sugar to ketone body metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>. During FMD, organs, including the immune system, liver, and heart, undergo shrinking, followed by regeneration during refeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

[[Fasting and exercise adaptations | Exercise]] is crucial in combination with dietary restrictions, particularly weight training, to prevent loss of lean body mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. Fasting causes a temporary loss of muscle mass, but refeeding rebuilds it, leading to a specific loss of visceral fat with minimal or no net loss of lean body mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. This makes FMD appealing for athletes aiming to increase lean muscle mass and decrease fat mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>.

## Growth Hormone and IGF-1 Pathways

Proteins and amino acids activate two major pro-aging pathways: the growth hormone (GH)-IGF-1 axis and tyrosine kinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. When these pathways are highly active, they contribute to aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>.
Genetic mutations affecting the GH receptor, as seen in mice (40-50% longer lifespan with fewer diseases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a> and in an Ecuadorian human population (reduced cancer and diabetes risk despite unhealthy lifestyles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>, demonstrate the powerful role of these pathways in longevity and disease prevention.

Fasting transiently lowers IGF-1, while refeeding allows it to rise, driving regeneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. This cyclical pattern is deemed more beneficial than chronic IGF-1 suppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>. IGF-1 is vital for muscle growth and repair, and crosses the blood-brain barrier to support new brain cell growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. Exercise also helps direct IGF-1 to muscles and the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.

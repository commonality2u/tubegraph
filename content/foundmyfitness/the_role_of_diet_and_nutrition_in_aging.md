The role of [[effects_of_diet_on_aging | diet]], nutrition, and other [[lifestyle_and_environmental_factors_affecting_aging | lifestyle factors]] such as sleep, exercise, and stress are significant interests in the field of longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. While a definitive dietary approach for human longevity cannot be established through randomized clinical trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, researchers rely on animal proxies and human biomarker analysis to estimate the effects of dietary and [[impact_of_lifestyle_habits_on_aging_and_longevity | lifestyle changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Key Growth Pathways and Aging

Two major growth pathways in the body are the IGF pathway and the mTOR pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. These pathways are responsible for both positive growth and pathological growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### mTOR Pathway
mTOR stands for mammalian target of rapamycin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. It forms two complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), with different activities in various tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. mTOR plays a crucial role in protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

*   **Regulation**: mTOR is primarily driven by amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Leucine is identified as the highest affinity amino acid sensor for mTORC1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. mTORC1 in muscle has a higher affinity for leucine than in fat or hepatocytes, preferentially signaling muscle growth during nutrient deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Balance**: Both too much and too little mTORC1 activity can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Overactivity is linked to aging and diseases like cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Lack of mTORC1 activity can lead to muscle wasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### IGF-1 Pathway
Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) is a growth factor necessary for processes like muscle growth, muscle repair, and neuronal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Regulation**: IGF-1 increases mTOR activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Both IGF-1 and mTOR are regulated by amino acid intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Methionine has been shown to be highly active in driving the IGF pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Influence of Carbohydrates/Insulin**: Insulin levels and carbohydrate intake play a significant role in the IGF pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Lower insulin levels correlate with higher IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), which impacts the amount of bioavailable IGF-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Highly refined carbohydrates and sugar consumption show a stronger correlation with cancer incidence than protein content in epidemiological studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Dietary Strategies for Longevity

The optimal [[diet and nutrition for performance and longevity | diet for longevity]] is highly individualized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

### Peter Attia's Approach: Balancing Macronutrients
Peter Attia focuses on regulating insulin response and the IGF-1/mTOR pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
1.  **Protein**: Consume the minimum amount required to maintain and grow muscle mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Most people overconsume protein relative to their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
2.  **Carbohydrate**: Lower carbohydrate intake to the lowest tolerable point that maintains a fasting insulin level below 3-4 IU and limits post-meal glycemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
3.  **Fat**: Becomes the "fill" to meet caloric needs after protein and carbohydrate targets are set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

### Rhonda Patrick's Approach: Gut Health and Micronutrients
Rhonda Patrick emphasizes the importance of [[impact_of_gut_health_on_aging_and_longevity | gut health]] and micronutrients.
*   **Gut Health**: The gut regulates the immune system and is a major source of [[role_of_inflammation_in_aging | inflammation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. [[role_of_inflammation_in_aging | Inflammation]] is a driver of the aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Eating fiber-rich foods supports beneficial gut bacteria, which produce short-chain fatty acids and other signaling molecules that regulate the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. Avoiding foods that cause gut damage is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
*   **Micronutrients**: Micronutrients serve as cofactors for enzymes and proteins involved in processes like keeping cancer cells in check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. Examples include zinc (for p53-dependent proteins) and [[magnesiums_role_in_metabolic_processes_and_aging | magnesium]] (important for repairing damage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

## Diet and Specific Diseases of Aging

Most people who live to extreme old age die from the same diseases as the general population, but later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. The goal for longevity is to delay the onset of the "big three" diseases: cerebrovascular/cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

### Cancer
IGF-1 and mTOR act as amplifiers, promoting the growth of already damaged cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Refined carbohydrates and sugars lead to inflammatory processes and cellular damage, initiating the problems that IGF-1 can amplify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Cancer cells are often glycolytic, optimizing for cellular building blocks rather than efficient ATP production via mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. Forcing mitochondria to be active, e.g., through fat oxidation in a ketogenic diet, can generate reactive oxygen species, which act as a pro-death signal for cancer cells that are "primed to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

### Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidence has risen by about 2.5% per year over the last 50 years, suggesting environmental triggers beyond natural aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.
*   **Brain Diabetes Hypothesis**: AD is strongly associated with Type 2 diabetes and hyperinsulinemia, leading some to view it as "brain diabetes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. This hypothesis suggests it's primarily a neuronal energy problem, where difficulty in glucose metabolism leads to the observed pathologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   **ApoE Genotype**: While ApoE4 genotype increases susceptibility to AD (a 3/4 genotype has about a 2x increased risk, and 4/4 has 10x-20x compared to 3/3), the majority of AD cases are still 3/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. The phenotype (serum ApoE levels) may be more predictive than the genotype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Impact**: [[impact_of_lifestyle_habits_on_aging_and_longevity | Lifestyle factors]] significantly impact AD risk, especially with an ApoE4 allele <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. Factors like alcohol consumption, refined carbohydrates, and sugar intake can cause damage and [[role_of_inflammation_in_aging_and_disease | inflammation]] that crosses the blood-brain barrier, exacerbating risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.
*   **Energy Substrates**: Neurons primarily use lactate from astrocytes, which generate lactate from glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is another thermodynamically favorable energy source that can bypass metabolic deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>. Ketogenic diets or exogenous BHB administration show promise in animal models and clinical trials for cognitive decline and traumatic brain injury (TBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>, partly by allowing glucose sparing for repair processes like glutathione synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.
*   **Insulin Sensitivity**: Being as insulin-sensitive as possible is hypothesized to reduce the risk of AD and other disease states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.

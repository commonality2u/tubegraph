Dr. Rhonda Patrick shares her daily [[health_benefits_of_blueberries_and_other_smoothie_ingredients | micronutrient smoothie]] recipe, which she drinks every morning, consuming half of the 64 fluid ounces (approximately 1.9 liters) and giving the rest to her husband [00:00:03].

## Ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>

The smoothie incorporates a wide array of fruits and vegetables, prioritizing a broad spectrum of compounds beyond just known vitamins and minerals [00:11:53].

*   Kale: 8 leaves [00:00:16]
*   Flax milk: 3 cups [00:00:17]
*   Rainbow chard: 4 leaves [00:00:26]
*   Spinach: 3 cups [00:00:29]
*   Tomato: 1 (size varies) [00:00:32]
*   Carrots: 2 medium-sized [00:00:33]
*   Apple: 1 whole with peel [00:00:33, 00:09:41]
*   Avocado: 1 large [00:00:34, 00:08:24]
*   Blueberries: 1 cup (frozen or fresh) [00:00:47, 00:09:44]
*   Banana: 1 [00:00:48, 00:10:34]
*   Flaxseed: 1 shot glass full [00:00:59, 00:10:51]
*   Unsweetened flaxseed milk: 3 cups [00:11:03]

## Preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>

All ingredients are combined and blended. Dr. Patrick uses a Blendtec blender, but any blender with a powerful motor is suitable [00:11:06]. The banana and avocado help maintain a good consistency, preventing the smoothie from separating [00:10:43].

## Key Micronutrients and Benefits

### Magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>

All green leafy vegetables in the smoothie, such as kale, chard, and spinach, are high in magnesium [00:01:09]. Magnesium is central to chlorophyll molecules, giving plants their green color [00:01:13]. Approximately 45% of the U.S. population does not meet the adequate daily intake for magnesium (350-400 mg) [00:01:23]. Athletes may require 10-15% more [00:01:32].

Magnesium is essential for over 300 enzymes in the body, including those involved in producing and using ATP, the cell's energetic currency [00:01:37]. ATP must bind to a magnesium ion to be biologically active [00:01:48].

Magnesium is also crucial for [[micronutrient_deficiencies_and_dna_damage | DNA repair]] enzymes, which fix DNA damage from normal metabolism and immune function, preventing mutations [00:02:05]. It's also required for DNA polymerases and DNA ligase, which ensure mutations don't occur during cell replication [00:02:23]. This makes magnesium very important in preventing [[role_of_micronutrients_in_preventing_agerelated_diseases | cancer-initiating factors]] like DNA damage and mutations [00:02:36].

*   **Contribution:** The smoothie provides approximately 588 milligrams of magnesium, exceeding the recommended daily allowance [00:02:45].

### Lutein and Zeaxanthin (from Kale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>

Kale is a rich source of lutein and zeaxanthin, two carotenoids highly concentrated in the eye's retina [00:03:02].

These carotenoids perform two vital functions in the eye:
1.  They filter out singlet oxygen, which is produced by blue light from the sun and is damaging to the rods and cones in the eye [00:03:13].
2.  They possess antioxidant activity, which has been shown to protect against various types of age-related macular degeneration [00:03:25]. They also slightly enhance visual performance [00:03:36].

*   **Contribution:** The smoothie provides approximately 390 milligrams of lutein and zeaxanthin [00:03:40].

### Isothiocyanates (from Kale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>

Kale, as a cruciferous vegetable, is high in sulfur-containing compounds called sulforaphanes [00:03:48]. When raw kale is chopped or chewed, enzymes called myrosinases convert sulforaphanes into isothiocyanates [00:03:54]. Myrosinases are heat-sensitive, so consuming raw kale helps maximize the intake of isothiocyanates [00:04:09]. While cooked kale offers other benefits like more magnesium and calcium, raw intake ensures isothiocyanate benefits [00:04:25].

Isothiocyanates have epigenetic effects, turning specific genes on and off [00:04:34]:
*   They turn off "bad" genes, specifically Phase One biotransformation enzymes, which convert pro-carcinogens into full-blown carcinogens [00:04:42].
*   They turn on "good" genes, such as Phase Two detoxification enzymes, which are a host of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes [00:04:55].
*   This mechanism helps [[role_of_micronutrients_in_preventing_agerelated_diseases | kill cancer cells]] by [[micronutrient_deficiencies_and_dna_damage | preventing DNA damage]] and activating tumor suppressor genes [00:05:11].

### Vitamin K1 (from Rainbow Chard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

Rainbow chard is an excellent source of vitamin K1 [00:05:28]. Approximately 65% of the U.S. population meets the adequate intake for vitamin K1 (90-120 micrograms per day) [00:05:33]. Both vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 act as cofactors to activate proteins that serve three main functions [00:05:52]:
1.  **Coagulation:** Blood clotting [00:06:00].
2.  **Calcium removal:** Taking calcium out of the bloodstream to prevent calcification of blood vessels and arteries [00:06:06].
3.  **Bone homeostasis:** Directing calcium to the bones for maintenance [00:06:12].

*   **Contribution:** The smoothie contains around 5,000 micrograms of vitamin K1 [00:06:18].

### Folate (from Spinach) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

Spinach is high in folate [00:06:29]. Folate is essential for incorporating thymine (a DNA nucleotide) into DNA [00:06:32]. Low folate levels lead to DNA misincorporating uracil (part of RNA) into DNA, causing a type of [[micronutrient_deficiencies_and_dna_damage | DNA damage]] similar to being irradiated [00:06:39].

Folate is also crucial for regulating epigenetics [00:06:55]. It serves as an important precursor to methyl groups, which are vital for epigenetic regulation [00:06:57].

*   **Contribution:** The smoothie provides approximately 480 micrograms of folate [00:07:10].

### Beta-carotene (from Carrots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>

Carrots are a great source of beta-carotene, another carotenoid [00:07:19]. Besides its antioxidant activity, beta-carotene is a pro-vitamin A because it can be converted into retinol (vitamin A) [00:07:23]. Around 34% of the U.S. population does not have adequate vitamin A intake [00:07:30]. Vitamin A is vital for normal immune system function and vision [00:07:37].

The body converts beta-carotene to vitamin A as needed; once vitamin A levels are sufficient, beta-carotene is used as an antioxidant instead [00:07:42].

*   **Contribution:** The smoothie contains about 54 milligrams of beta-carotene [00:07:51].

### Lycopene (from Tomatoes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>

Tomatoes are a good source of lycopene, another carotenoid with antioxidant activity [00:08:02]. Lycopene accumulates in most body tissues and is potent at inhibiting angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels), a mechanism by which cancer cells metastasize [00:08:09].

*   **Contribution:** The smoothie has about 2,500 micrograms of lycopene [00:08:21].

### Potassium (from Avocado and Banana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>

Avocados are an excellent source of potassium; one large avocado provides around 1,000 milligrams [00:08:28]. The adequate intake for potassium is set at 4,700 milligrams per day, a requirement met by only 3% of Americans [00:08:31]. This requirement is based on the amount needed to maintain normal blood pressure and decrease the risk of kidney stones [00:08:42]. Bananas also contribute potassium [00:10:34].

*   **Contribution:** The smoothie provides approximately 5,800 milligrams of potassium, meeting the adequate intake requirement [00:08:51].

### Vitamin E and Monounsaturated Fat (from Avocado) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>

Avocados are a great source of the vitamin E family, including mixed tocopherols (alpha and gamma) and mixed tocotrienols [00:08:59]. Vitamin E is a crucial antioxidant, particularly for lipoproteins in the vascular system, preventing their oxidation, a major factor in atherosclerosis [00:09:09]. Around 60% of the U.S. population does not get enough vitamin E [00:09:20].

Avocados also provide monounsaturated fat, which increases the dietary absorption of all carotenoids present in the smoothie, including lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-carotene, and lycopene [00:09:26].

### Flavonoids (from Apple Peel and Blueberries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>

Apple peel and blueberries are high in flavonoids, compounds produced by most plants [00:09:51]. Apple peel contains quercetin and epicatechin [00:09:56], while blueberries are rich in anthocyanins [00:09:59].

These flavonoids are potent at sequestering reactive oxygen species produced in cells, protecting against [[micronutrient_deficiencies_and_dna_damage | DNA damage]], lipid damage, and protein damage, all of which contribute to diseases of aging [00:10:03]. They also activate Phase Two detoxification enzymes (the same ones activated by isothiocyanates) [00:10:15]. Furthermore, they lower inflammation by inhibiting genes that activate inflammation [00:10:24]. These are general mechanisms by which flavonoids reduce oxidation and inflammation in the body [00:10:29].

### Soluble Fiber and Alpha Linoleic Acid (from Flaxseed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>

Flaxseed is a great source of [[micronutrient_and_fiber_importance | soluble fiber]] when ground up [00:10:54]. It also provides alpha-linolenic acid, a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid [00:10:57].

## Overall Nutritional Contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>

The entire 64-fluid-ounce smoothie provides the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for the following [[health_benefits_of_micronutrient_supplementation | micronutrients]] [00:11:17]:
*   Vitamin A [00:11:21]
*   Vitamin B5 [00:11:23]
*   Vitamin B6 [00:11:24]
*   Vitamin C [00:11:25]
*   Folate [00:11:26]
*   Calcium [00:11:27]
*   Magnesium [00:11:28]
*   Iron [00:11:29]
*   Manganese [00:11:30]
*   Copper [00:11:31]
*   Alpha-linolenic acid [00:11:32]
*   Fiber [00:11:32]

Beyond the known vitamins and minerals, the smoothie emphasizes the "unknowns" – other compounds in plants that science is still mapping for their interactions with human metabolism [00:11:36]. Dr. Patrick encourages diversifying the fruits and vegetables in the smoothie, likening it to diversifying a stock portfolio, to ensure a broad spectrum of beneficial compounds [00:12:12].

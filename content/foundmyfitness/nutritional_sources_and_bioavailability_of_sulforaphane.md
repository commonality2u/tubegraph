[[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | Sulforaphane]] is a potent naturally occurring dietary activator of the Nrf2 genetic pathway, which regulates over 200 genes, many of which are antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and also genes involved in deactivating potentially harmful compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It is an [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | isothiocyanate]] formed from compounds known as glucosinolates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Specifically, [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | sulforaphane]] is derived from [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | glucoraphanin]], sometimes referred to as [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | sulforaphane]] glucosinolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Nutritional Sources of Sulforaphane
[[Cruciferous Vegetables and Cardiovascular Health | Cruciferous vegetables]] are the primary source of [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | sulforaphane]] and other [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | isothiocyanates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This group includes:
*   Broccoli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Brussels sprouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Cauliflower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Cabbage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Collard greens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Bok choy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Pak choi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Watercress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   Land cress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   Radish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Daikon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Wasabi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>

The single best source of [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | glucoraphanin]] (and thus [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | sulforaphane]]) is [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | broccoli sprouts]], which contain up to 100 times more glucosinolates than their mature counterpart, broccoli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Sprouting can also be done inexpensively at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Bioavailability of Sulforaphane
The formation of [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | sulforaphane]] from [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | glucoraphanin]] requires an enzyme called myrosinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Factors Influencing Formation and Absorption
*   **Myrosinase Activation**: Myrosinase is activated when the [[Cruciferous Vegetables and Cardiovascular Health | cruciferous plant]] tissue is crushed, chopped, or chewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Heat Sensitivity**: Myrosinase is inactivated under conditions of prolonged heat, such as sustained boiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Gut Bacteria**: Even if dietary sources of myrosinase are lacking, some gut bacteria produce myrosinase, which can still convert raw [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | glucoraphanin]] into [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | sulforaphane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:43:46]</a>. However, this ability varies widely among individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Bioavailability Percentage**: Only about 20% of [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | glucoraphanin]] is bioavailable and converted into [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | sulforaphane]] in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. Therefore, it's important that the [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | sulforaphane]] source has a high amount of its precursor, [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | glucoraphanin]], to begin with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.

### Maximizing Sulforaphane Production from Vegetables
*   **Light Steaming**: Three to four minutes of very light steaming can be optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. This method deactivates epithiospecifier protein, which normally prevents [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | sulforaphane]] formation, while keeping myrosinase activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.
*   **Optimal Temperature**:
    *   Mature broccoli: Heating to 60 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.
    *   [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | Broccoli sprouts]]: Heating to around 70 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. One study showed this increased [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | sulforaphane]] production by about 3.5 fold in [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | broccoli sprouts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>.
    *   Substantially higher temperatures will inactivate the myrosinase enzyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

### [[Sulforaphane supplements and their reliability | Sulforaphane Supplements]]
Many [[Sulforaphane supplements and their reliability | sulforaphane supplements]] on the market contain [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | glucoraphanin]] (sulforaphane glucosinolate) but often lack the necessary myrosinase for conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>. To improve absorption with such supplements:
*   Consume [[Cruciferous Vegetables and Cardiovascular Health | cruciferous vegetables]] that contain myrosinase alongside the supplemental [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | glucoraphanin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.
*   One study showed a nearly two-fold increase in [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | sulforaphane]] absorption when [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | broccoli sprouts]] and broccoli sprout powder were consumed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.
*   Mustard seed may also be an effective supplemental source of myrosinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.

## Potential Concerns: Goitrogenic Activity
Some studies suggest that [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | isothiocyanates]] can compete with iodine for transport into the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>. However, most evidence indicates this is only a problem under conditions of severe iodine deficiency, which is uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>. Healthy individuals consuming a significant amount of [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | isothiocyanates]] (roughly equivalent to 70 grams of [[Broccoli sprouts and glucoraphanin | broccoli sprouts]]) did not experience negative effects on thyroid hormones or demonstrate liver toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>. The evidence for the usefulness of [[Sulforaphane and its health benefits | isothiocyanates]] is considered too strong to dismiss them as anti-nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.

The SENS Research Foundation, based in Mountain View, California, is a biomedical research charity (501(c)(3)) founded by Dr. Aubrey de Grey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Its ambitious goal is to help prevent and cure aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Understanding Aging and Damage

The SENS Research Foundation approaches aging not as a simple disease, but as an inevitable side effect of being alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It views aging as the consequence of the accumulation of various molecular and cellular changes, referred to as "damage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Initially, this damage is harmless as the body can tolerate a certain amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. However, eventually, this damage exceeds tolerance, leading to mental and physical decline, and the diseases and disabilities associated with old age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The "clock of aging" is identified as the accumulation of damage that the body cannot genetically repair, even in youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This unrepaired damage accelerates the creation of new damage and impedes the body's existing damage repair mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Types of accumulated damage include:
*   Damage to DNA inside cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   Changes in cell function, such as cells becoming stiffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   Protein aggregation, altering protein function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   [[the_potential_of_epigenetic_reversal_in_antiaging_research | Epigenetic changes]] affecting gene expression and function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## SENS Approach to Anti-Aging

The core strategy of the SENS Research Foundation is to develop a panel of interventions that can periodically *repair* these various types of molecular and cellular damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This approach aims to keep the overall abundance of damage in the body below a threshold where it becomes harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Dr. de Grey notes that while it's fascinating that some people and species age more quickly, and gerontology has often focused on understanding this variation to slow aging, SENS differentiates its approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. He expresses skepticism about modifying metabolism to prevent damage creation, considering it too complicated and unlikely to succeed without negative side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Instead, the focus remains on repairing damage once it occurs, rather than solely trying to prevent its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

## Research Areas and Technologies

The SENS Research Foundation focuses on research into the diseases and disabilities of old age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Key areas of investigation include:

### Epigenetic Noise
SENS funds a project at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, which looks at single-cell [[the_potential_of_epigenetic_reversal_in_antiaging_research | epigenetic changes]], specifically methylation, to quantify epigenetic noise and variation that happens without genetic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The hypothesis is that epigenetic noise will not increase to a detectable degree with age, as DNA maintenance and repair are evolutionarily driven by the need to prevent cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Parabiosis and Blood Factors
SENS is funding a postdoc at Berkeley working on parabiosis research, which involves transferring blood from a young animal to an old one to reverse aging biomarkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. While parabiosis itself isn't a therapeutic regimen, it's a valuable discovery tool that could lead to alternative approaches like plasma exchange to alter blood components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. The challenge is identifying the specific factors to remove or add to achieve rejuvenation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. SENS also emphasizes looking for the cellular sources of changes in the blood (e.g., thymus shrinkage leading to T-cell changes) to rejuvenate those cells directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

### [[Impact of technological advances like CRISPR and pluripotent stem cells on aging research | Impact of Technological Advances]]
The Foundation actively incorporates [[impact_of_technological_advances_like_crispr_and_pluripotent_stem_cells_on_aging_research | technological innovations]] into its research, particularly in the realm of [[crispr_and_gene_therapy_for_disease_and_longevity | gene editing]] and regenerative medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

#### [[CRISPR and gene therapy for disease and longevity | CRISPR]]
[[CRISPR and gene therapy for disease and longevity | CRISPR]] is considered a "particularly important advance" for SENS's work because genetic modifications are necessary for comprehensive damage repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. [[CRISPR and gene therapy for disease and longevity | CRISPR]]'s high site-specificity and fidelity address a major safety concern of traditional gene therapy, which uses viral vectors that are hard to control in terms of DNA insertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. This allows for increased "titer" (amount of engineered DNA) and "penetrance" (proportion of modified cells) without increasing off-target effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. While *ex vivo* (outside the body) [[gene_editing_methods_including_crispr_and_alternatives | gene editing]] is easier, *in vivo* delivery to specific tissues like the liver, heart, or muscle remains a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>.

#### [[Impact of technological advances like CRISPR and pluripotent stem cells on aging research | Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)]]
The ability to reprogram cells, such as skin cells, into [[Impact of technological advances like CRISPR and pluripotent stem cells on aging research | pluripotent stem cells]] that can form any cell type in the body is highly exciting for SENS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.
*   **Viral vs. Non-viral Methods**: While initial methods often used viruses, non-viral methods like messenger RNA or electroporating proteins are now perfected, though efficiency is improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
*   **Reprogramming Quality**: Newer methods, like using six reprogramming factors instead of the original Yamanaka factors, achieve higher fidelity reprogramming, even allowing for the reprogramming of senescent cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.
*   **Epigenetic Memory**: While standard iPSC methods may retain some "epigenetic memory" of the original cell type, newer techniques minimize this, and researchers are exploring how much elimination is truly necessary for therapeutic applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
*   **Autologous Administration**: The ideal scenario is taking cells from a patient, reprogramming them, modifying them as needed, and reinjecting them into the same person to avoid immune reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>. As costs decrease, this personalized approach is expected to become standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>.

The SENS Research Foundation's work emphasizes that while lifestyle factors and nutrition are important for health and life expectancy, they offer only marginal gains in the absence of targeted interventions to repair the fundamental molecular and cellular damage of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

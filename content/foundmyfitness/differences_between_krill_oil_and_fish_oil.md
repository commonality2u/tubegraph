Dr. Rhonda Patrick discusses the similarities and differences between krill oil and fish oil, focusing on omega-3 fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These essential fatty acids are required by the human body but cannot be produced internally, necessitating dietary intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Data indicates that omega-3 fatty acids are among the top dietary factors influencing early mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Established [[benefits_of_omega3_fatty_acids | Benefits of Omega-3 Fatty Acids]]

Supplementation with EPA and DHA offers several well-documented benefits:
*   Lowers all-cause mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   Slows the attrition of telomeres, a biological marker for aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Delays [[omega3_fatty_acids_and_brain_health | brain aging]] by aiding brain repair and reducing brain atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   Lowers inflammation, which contributes to tissue damage and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   Increases HDL (high-density lipoprotein) and lowers triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   Plays a crucial role in cell membrane fluidity, which is vital for neuron function and neurotransmitter activity (e.g., norepinephrine for focus and attention) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Key Distinctions Between Krill Oil and Fish Oil

Several characteristics differentiate krill oil from fish oil, which may influence supplementation choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>:
1.  The omega-3 fatty acids in krill oil are more bioavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
2.  The DHA variety in krill oil is preferred by the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Krill oil contains a unique antioxidant not present in fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## [[bioavailability_of_omega3_forms | Bioavailability of Omega-3 Forms]]

### Fish Oil Processing
Fish oil is commonly modified through molecular distillation to concentrate EPA and DHA and remove contaminants like mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This process converts omega-3 fatty acids from their natural triglyceride form (three fatty acids bound to a glycerol backbone) into an ethyl ester form (glycerol backbone replaced with an ethanol backbone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. While they can be re-esterified to triglyceride form, most fish oil supplements on the market are in the less bioavailable ethyl ester form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Krill Oil Composition
The omega-3 fatty acids in krill oil are primarily found in phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. These phospholipids have a fat-soluble diacylglycerol and a water-soluble phosphate group attached to an organic molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Omega-3 fatty acids in phospholipid form are more bioavailable than those in triglyceride form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Absorption Mechanisms
Omega-3 bioavailability is heavily influenced by absorption in the small intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Fish Oil:** EPA and DHA from fish oil (triglyceride or ethyl ester forms) must first be cleaved by pancreatic lipase enzymes into free omega-3 fatty acids for absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Ethyl esters are poor substrates for pancreatic lipase, leading to poor absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Krill Oil:** Omega-3 fatty acids in krill oil can be cleaved by phospholipase enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. However, phospholipids do not necessarily need to be cleaved; they can form micelles and be absorbed in their intact form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Gastric lipase in the stomach can break down fatty acids in triglycerides but not phospholipids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Research Findings
Studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids from krill oil (phospholipid form) are more bioavailable than those from fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   Mice given identical doses of EPA and DHA in phospholipid, triglyceride, or ethyl ester forms showed the highest plasma concentrations from phospholipid form, followed by triglyceride, and then ethyl ester <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   Human studies showed that lower doses of krill oil (38% less) resulted in similar plasma EPA and DHA levels compared to higher doses of fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   This data suggests higher bioavailability for omega-3 fatty acids in krill oil's phospholipid form compared to fish oil's triglyceride or ethyl ester forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## [[omega3_fatty_acids_and_brain_health | Brain Health]] and DHA Transport

DHA is the most abundant fatty acid in the brain, making up 10-20% of its total lipid composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The brain prefers a form called DHA lysophosphatidylcholine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This is a byproduct of DHA in phosphatidylcholine after cleavage by lipases in the intestine or bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Since krill oil is a rich source of phosphatidylcholine, it implies it would also be a good source of DHA lysophosphatidylcholine, unlike fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Research shows that DHA lysophosphatidylcholine accumulates significantly more (tenfold) in the brains of developing rats and piglets compared to DHA in free fatty acid form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. A specialized DHA transporter called MFSD2a, identified in May 2014, transports DHA lysophosphatidylcholine across the blood-brain barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Mice lacking this transporter had 60% less DHA in their brains, though levels in the heart and liver were unaffected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Red blood cells also prefer DHA lysophosphatidylcholine, and their DHA concentration correlates with brain DHA levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## [[astaxanthin_in_krill_oil | Unique Antioxidant: Astaxanthin]]

Krill oil uniquely contains astaxanthin, a carotenoid not found in fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   Astaxanthin sequesters singlet oxygen (produced by UV radiation) and is a potent antioxidant against peroxy radicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. These reactive species damage DNA, lipids, and proteins, contributing to diseases of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   It is easily absorbed by the human bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   Its amphipathic structure (both fat and water-soluble portions) allows it to accumulate in cell membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This is beneficial because DHA, which is prone to oxidation, also accumulates in cell membranes where it supports fluidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Astaxanthin can protect DHA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids from oxidation in cell membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Other antioxidants like glutathione are produced in the soluble portion of the cell and do not accumulate in cell membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   Beyond its protective role, astaxanthin has independent benefits, shown in clinical trials to lower inflammation, decrease DNA damage (including oxidation), and increase HDL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. These mechanisms are relevant to degenerative diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Other Unique Phospholipids in Krill Oil

Krill oil is also a significant source of other phospholipids, specifically phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. These accumulate in mitochondrial and cell membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Their concentration has been shown to decrease with age in these membranes, which plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Conclusion

Krill oil offers several advantages over fish oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>:
*   Its EPA and DHA are more bioavailable due to their phospholipid form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   It provides DHA in the preferred form for brain uptake (DHA lysophosphatidylcholine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   It includes the antioxidant [[astaxanthin_in_krill_oil | astaxanthin]], which helps protect DHA and offers additional health benefits against diseases of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   It is a source of other important phospholipids like phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, which are vital for cellular and mitochondrial membrane health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

Dr. Rhonda Patrick personally supplements with both fish oil (in triglyceride form) and krill oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Omega-3 fatty acids are among the essential micronutrients that are often inadequate in the diet of many people in developed countries, including the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05">[02:05]</a>. Along with vitamins and minerals, fatty acids are vital for bodily functions, from metabolism to enzyme activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30">[02:30]</a>.

Dr. Rhonda Patrick highlights omega-3s as a "low hanging fruit" that can significantly [[role_of_omega3_in_longevity_and_health | impact healthy aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38">[01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08">[14:08]</a>. She considers them one of the most important yet overlooked and understudied nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50">[19:50]</a>.

## Types of Omega-3 Fatty Acids
There are three main types of omega-3 fatty acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30">[20:30]</a>:
*   **Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)**: Found in plant sources like flax seeds and walnuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34">[20:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36">[23:36]</a>. ALA is considered an essential fatty acid because the body can convert it into EPA and DHA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28">[22:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43">[22:43]</a>. However, this conversion is often very inefficient and varies due to genetic differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16">[23:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22">[23:22]</a>. High intake of omega-6 fatty acids from vegetable oils can also compete with the enzyme needed for this conversion, further reducing efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14">[24:14]</a>. Estrogen can significantly increase this conversion efficiency, especially during pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44">[24:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48">[24:48]</a>.
*   **Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)** and **Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)**: Primarily found in marine sources like fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel, sardines) and microalgae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41">[20:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47">[20:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51">[20:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47">[31:47]</a>.

## Impact on Health and Longevity

### Mortality Rates
A 2009 Harvard study identified inadequate intake of marine omega-3 sources (EPA and DHA) as one of the top six preventable causes of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54">[20:54]</a>. It was calculated that approximately 84,000 deaths per year were attributable to insufficient dietary EPA and DHA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07">[21:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19">[21:19]</a>. This figure is comparable to the 82,000 deaths per year attributed to trans fats, highlighting the significant public health impact of omega-3 deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25">[21:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47">[21:47]</a>. Globally, about 80% of people do not get enough EPA and DHA, and in the U.S., this figure is as high as 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:08">[35:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:15">[35:15]</a>.

### [[role_of_omega3_in_longevity_and_health | Longevity]]
Studies on the [[omega3_index | omega-3 index]] (measuring EPA and DHA levels in red blood cell membranes) show a strong correlation with life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31">[26:31]</a>. Most people in the U.S. have an [[omega3_index | omega-3 index]] of less than 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13">[27:13]</a>. Research indicates that individuals with an [[omega3_index | omega-3 index]] of 8% have a five-year increased life expectancy compared to those with an [[omega3_index | omega-3 index]] of 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23">[27:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30">[27:30]</a>.

Remarkably, a study found that smokers with a high [[omega3_index | omega-3 index]] (8%) had the same life expectancy as non-smokers with a low [[omega3_index | omega-3 index]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01">[28:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13">[28:13]</a>. This suggests that the detrimental effects of smoking on mortality were comparable to the absence of sufficient omega-3s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19">[28:19]</a>.

### Cellular Function and Inflammation
Omega-3 fatty acids accumulate in cell membranes, influencing the function of transporters and receptors embedded within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37">[28:37]</a>. For example, glucose transporters at the blood-brain barrier are impaired when DHA is deficient, leading to reduced glucose uptake into the brain <a class="yt=" data-t="28:47">[28:47]</a>.

A key benefit of omega-3s is their role in resolving inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03">[29:03]</a>. Metabolites of EPA and DHA, known as specialized pro-resolving molecules (SPMs) like mericins, protectins, and resolvins, efficiently resolve inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07">[29:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11">[29:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17">[29:17]</a>. Chronic low-level inflammation (inflammaging) is a significant driver of the aging process itself, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21">[29:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27">[29:27]</a>. Omega-3s improve inflammatory processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37">[30:37]</a>.

### [[omega3_fatty_acids_and_brain_health | Brain Health]]
Omega-3s, particularly DHA, are crucial for [[omega3_fatty_acids_and_brain_health | brain health]] throughout the lifespan, from infancy to old age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02">[25:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:23">[35:23]</a>. Studies show that mothers who consume fish during pregnancy have children with better neurodevelopmental outcomes and higher intelligence, suggesting [[omega3_fatty_acids_and_brain_health | omega-3 benefits for brain development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:15">[32:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50">[32:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04">[33:04]</a>. Even in the presence of mercury in fish, omega-3s appear to protect against neurotoxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07">[32:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:44">[32:44]</a>.

### [[omega3s_impact_on_muscle_health_and_muscle_preservation | Muscle Health and Preservation]]
Emerging research highlights a new role for omega-3s in [[omega3s_impact_on_muscle_health_and_muscle_preservation | muscle mass]] and [[anabolic_potential_of_omega3_fatty_acids | sensitizing muscle to amino acids]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51">[30:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59">[30:59]</a>. Chris McGlory's work suggests that omega-3s play a role in preventing [[role_of_omega3_in_muscle_disuse_atrophy | muscle disuse atrophy]] through an [[anabolic_potential_of_omega3_fatty_acids | anabolic]] mechanism, distinct from their anti-inflammatory effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10">[31:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16">[31:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20">[31:20]</a>. It is thought to involve [[omega3s_effects_on_muscle_protein_synthesis and mitochondrial function | effects on muscle protein synthesis]], possibly by sensitizing muscle to amino acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26">[31:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31">[31:31]</a>.

## Dietary Sources and Supplementation
The best way to obtain EPA and DHA is through dietary sources like fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines, which are also generally low in contaminants like mercury and PCBs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47">[31:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52">[31:52]</a>. While fish contain contaminants, studies suggest that the omega-3 fatty acids themselves offer protection against their negative effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02">[32:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:13">[32:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:37">[33:37]</a>.

For those who don't consume enough fish, supplementation is a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:09">[34:09]</a>.
*   **Dosage**: 1.5 to 2 grams of supplemental omega-3s daily can potentially increase an [[omega3_index | omega-3 index]] from 4% to 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18">[34:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:25">[34:25]</a>. Prescription forms like Lovaza or Vascepa (purified EPA) are deemed very safe at 4 grams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31">[34:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:38">[34:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47">[34:47]</a>. Omega-3s have the safety profile of a nutrient but are pharmacologically active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52">[34:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00">[35:00]</a>.
*   **Form and Quality**:
    *   **Triglyceride form**: Generally more [[bioavailability_of_omega3_forms | bioavailable]] and better incorporated into cell membranes compared to ethyl ester forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:29">[36:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:42">[36:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:54">[36:54]</a>. Ethyl ester forms should be taken with food, ideally a higher fat meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:43">[36:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:47">[36:47]</a>.
    *   **Oxidation Status**: Fish oil is prone to oxidation. Quality supplements use isolation protocols (e.g., under liquid nitrogen) to minimize oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05">[37:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:10">[37:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17">[37:17]</a>.
    *   **Contaminants**: Reputable third-party testing sites, such as the International Fish Oil Standards (IFOS) website, provide data on oxidation status, PCBs, and mercury levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:20">[37:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26">[37:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28">[37:28]</a>. Due to purification processes, contaminants are less of a concern in supplements compared to whole fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07">[38:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:10">[38:10]</a>. The [[benefits_of_omega3_fatty_acids | benefits of omega-3s]] in reducing inflammation are considered to outweigh any potential harm from trace contaminants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:02">[39:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07">[39:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16">[39:16]</a>.

It is recommended to measure your [[omega3_index | omega-3 index]] to determine your status and monitor the effectiveness of supplementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04">[20:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08">[20:08]</a>.

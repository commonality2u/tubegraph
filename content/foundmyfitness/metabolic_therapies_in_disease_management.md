Metabolic therapies, including fasting and fasting-mimicking diets, are emerging as powerful interventions for managing a variety of human diseases by leveraging the body's inherent self-repair and regeneration mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Dr. Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology and Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California and Director of the Longevity Institute, has significantly contributed to understanding these effects on aging, lifespan, and healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Fasting and Fasting-Mimicking Diets (FMDs)
Dr. Longo's research focuses on periodic fasting and specifically on [[caloric_restriction_mimetics_and_their_potential_therapeutic_benefits | fasting-mimicking diets]] (FMDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These diets are designed to "trick the system" into believing it is fasting, even while consuming a specific composition of nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. A typical FMD consists of a diet low in protein and sugar, and high in healthy fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Fasting vs. Caloric Restriction
[[caloric_restriction_mimetics_and_their_potential_therapeutic_benefits | Caloric restriction]] (CR) involves a consistent reduction of calories (e.g., 20% to 30%) without full fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Periodic fasting and FMDs, however, are more extreme and are designed to "orchestrate a lot of genes" to achieve specific effects like increased protection and stem cell activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

A key distinction is the role of refeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While the restriction phase of fasting activates stem cells, it is the refeeding period that triggers the rebuilding and regeneration of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This coordinated effect of fasting and refeeding cycles is absent in continuous [[caloric_restriction_mimetics_and_their_therapeutic_benefits | caloric restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Fasting as a "Normal" State
> Valter Longo views fasting not as a stressor, but as a "normal" environment that organisms have evolved to experience, enabling a "shielded mode" for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. He proposes a "program A" (starvation/shielded mode) and "program B" (growth/reproduction) framework, where the environment dictates which program the body adopts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Action

### Cellular Regeneration and Immune System Rejuvenation
Prolonged fasting (e.g., 48-72 hours in animals) leads to a decrease in white blood cell populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This reduction is primarily due to apoptosis (programmed cell death) rather than [[potential_therapeutic_approaches_to_manage_cellular_senescence | autophagy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. For instance, in mice, about 40% of white blood cells are destroyed during a four-day fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Upon refeeding, these populations are rapidly rebuilt, representing one of the most powerful regenerative programs since birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

This process has implications for human aging, particularly in combating immunosenescence, the age-related decline in immune function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Fasting has been shown to return lymphocyte numbers to more youthful levels and normalize the myeloid-to-lymphoid cell ratio, effectively rejuvenating the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This could help mitigate age-related susceptibility to infections and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Inflammation as a Marker of Aging
While chronic inflammation is consistently observed in aging populations and linked to mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, Longo suggests that aging causes inflammation, rather than inflammation being the primary driver of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Metabolic therapies, such as FMDs, have been shown to decrease inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6 in both mice and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This reduction in inflammation indicates that the body's systems are being reset to a more youthful state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### IGF-1 Pathway
[[Role of ketones in chronic diseases | Proteins and amino acids]] activate two major pro-aging pathways: the growth hormone IGF-1 axis and tyrosine kinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. Reducing these pathways is associated with increased longevity and reduced disease incidence, as observed in mice with a knocked-out growth hormone receptor and in humans with similar genetic mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>.
*   **Fasting:** Lowers IGF-1, promoting cellular protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.
*   **Refeeding:** Increases IGF-1, driving regeneration, muscle growth, and brain cell growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>.

## Applications in Disease Management

### Cancer
Fasting and FMDs show potential in cancer therapy by inducing:
*   **Differential Stress Resistance (DSR):** Normal cells enter a protective, resistant mode during starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.
*   **Differential Stress Sensitization (DSS):** Cancer cells, due to their oncogenic programming and dependence on high nourishment, cannot enter this protective mode and become more vulnerable to chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. They become "desperate" when nutrients like glucose and amino acids are low, trying to increase translation instead of shutting down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.
*   **Anti-Warburg Effect:** Fasting lowers glucose, forcing cancer cells to rely on oxidative phosphorylation via mitochondria for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. This can lead to increased [[role_of_ketones_in_chronic_diseases | reactive oxygen species]] production, making the cancer cells vulnerable to suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.
*   **Immune System Modulation:** Fasting can make cancer cells more immunogenic, improving their recognition and elimination by immune cells, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.

Clinical trials in cancer patients have shown that fasting before or after chemotherapy can protect normal cells from damage while sensitizing cancer cells to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
> [!IMPORTANT] Combination Therapy
> Studies in mice show that combining starvation/FMDs with chemotherapy leads to cancer-free survival, a result rarely seen with either intervention alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. This highlights the importance of integrating conventional and scientifically-backed metabolic therapies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

### Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Autoimmune Diseases
In mouse models of MS, FMDs destroy autoimmune white blood cells and activate stem cells to generate new, non-autoimmune cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. FMDs also reduce inflammation around the spinal cord, allowing progenitor cells to regenerate myelin and rebuild the spinal cord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>.

In a human clinical study, a single week of FMD followed by a Mediterranean diet showed better outcomes for MS patients than six months of a continuous ketogenic diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.

### Other Diseases
Metabolic therapies, including FMDs, are being explored for a range of other conditions:
*   **Diabetes:** Clinical trials are underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   **Cardiovascular Disease:** Tested clinically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.
*   **Crohn's Disease:** Anecdotal success with FMDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Diseases:** Mouse studies are ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>.

## Practical Considerations
For healthy individuals seeking longevity benefits, Longo suggests a flexible approach combining [[benefits_of_timerestricted_eating_and_metabolic_health | time-restricted eating]] (e.g., within a 12-hour window) and meal frequency adjusted to individual needs (e.g., two meals a day for overweight individuals, three for underweight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. This approach aims for compliance by aligning with existing habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

For deeper effects like stem cell regeneration and sustained ketosis (burning visceral fat and [[therapeutic_benefits_of_ketone_supplementation | ketone bodies]]), a 14-hour overnight fast is generally not enough, as the body primarily burns glycogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. A prolonged FMD (e.g., five days) is typically required to induce these deeper metabolic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.

FMDs facilitate fat loss, particularly visceral fat, while preserving or rebuilding lean body mass, making them appealing even to athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>.
*   **Exercise:** Combining FMDs with [[metabolic_adaptations_and_mitochondrial_biogenesis_through_exercise | exercise]], especially weight training, is crucial to send signals to muscles for rebuilding and prevent loss of lean body mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>.

### Safety and Availability
Fasting and FMDs are powerful interventions that require caution, especially for individuals with existing diseases, those taking medications, or those who are underweight or anorexic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. Consultation with a doctor is recommended to assess suitability and potential interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

For broader availability, Dr. Longo founded L-Nutra (l-nutra.com), which produces a clinically tested FMD product called ProLon FMD (fmd.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>. Physicians are increasingly recommending these products to patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Pharmaceutical Interventions for Aging
> Longo expresses caution regarding pharmaceutical drugs designed to intervene in central cellular pathways (e.g., metformin activating AMP kinase), especially for healthy individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>. While such drugs may offer benefits, the long-term side effects of continuously perturbing core biological systems are not fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. He advocates for interventions supported by long-term human observational data, such as genetic mutations affecting growth hormone pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Metabolic interventions like FMDs are poised to become standard practice in doctor's offices worldwide within the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>. Their potential to allow the body to heal itself marks a significant shift from a drug-centered mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>.

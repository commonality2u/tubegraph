Dr. Rhonda Patrick, a PhD holder focused on the aging process and disease prevention, highlights sauna use as a modality she believes will become part of standard care for preventing and treating cardiovascular conditions and promoting longevity within the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. She advocates for spending at least 20 minutes in a hot sauna a couple of times a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Emerging Research on Sauna Bathing
Over the past few decades, compelling research, including observational studies, prospective studies, interventional trials, and mechanistic studies, indicates that [[Health benefits of sauna use | sauna bathing improves overall health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

### Finnish Sauna Studies
Much of the largest prospective research on [[Sauna use and cardiovascular health benefits | sauna use and cardiovascular health benefits]] originates from Eastern Finland, utilizing data from the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, an ongoing prospective study that began in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

Studies from this cohort show dose-dependent effects based on frequency and duration of sauna use:
*   **Sudden Cardiac Death**:
    *   Using the sauna 2-3 times a week was associated with a 22% lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
    *   Using it 4-7 times a week led to a 63% lower risk compared to once a week users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
    *   Spending at least 11 minutes in the sauna resulted in a 7% lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
    *   Spending 20 minutes or more showed a 50% reduction in sudden cardiac death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
*   **Coronary Heart Disease Related Death**:
    *   2-3 times a week use showed a 23% lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
    *   4-7 times a week use showed a 43% lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
*   **Fatal Cardiovascular Mortality**:
    *   2-3 times a week use was linked to a 27% lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
    *   4-7 times a week use was linked to a 50% lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Stroke Risk**:
    *   2-3 times a week use was associated with a 14% lower stroke risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
    *   4-7 times a week use was associated with a 60% lower stroke risk in both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.
*   **Hypertension**:
    *   Using the sauna 4-7 times a week showed a 50% reduction in the risk of hypertension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
    *   A single 30-minute Finnish sauna exposure has been shown to lower blood pressure and improve arterial compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

Finnish saunas are typically around 174°F (79°C) with up to 20% humidity, achieved by throwing water on hot rocks to create steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. A duration of at least 20 minutes was key for robust effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. More frequent use (4-7 times a week) consistently yielded stronger effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

### Far Infrared Ray (Waon) Therapy
Another type of sauna, Waon therapy, uses far infrared rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. These saunas are typically cooler, around 140°F (60°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>, with longer durations (around 45 minutes) and daily frequency over 2-3 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. Unlike Finnish saunas that heat ambient air, far infrared saunas heat the body directly through thermal radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

Randomized trials using Waon therapy have shown benefits for heart disease management:
*   Patients with chronic heart failure who underwent 2-3 weeks of daily far infrared sauna treatment experienced improved endurance, heart size, and disease status compared to control groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   Patients with ischemic heart disease treated with Waon therapy for three weeks showed improved vascular endothelial function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

## Physiological Overlap Between Sauna Use and Exercise
The beneficial effects of sauna and heat stress on the cardiovascular system stem from their physiological similarities to physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
When in a sauna:
*   Skin temperature increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.
*   Blood flow shifts from organs to the skin (50-70% redistribution) to facilitate sweating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
*   Heart rate increases up to 150 beats per minute, equivalent to moderate physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.
*   Stroke volume remains the same, but cardiac output increases by 60-70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

A study in *Complementary Therapies of Medicine* found that a 25-minute sauna session produced identical effects on heart rate and blood pressure as a 25-minute session on a stationary bike at 100 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. Both activities caused an immediate increase in heart rate and blood pressure during the session, followed by a decrease below baseline levels immediately after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

### Effects on the Autonomic Nervous System
Sauna use also mirrors the effects of physical activity on the autonomic nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.
*   A single 30-minute Finnish sauna session lowered heart rate after the session and increased heart rate variability, indicating improved capacity of the heart to respond favorably under stressful conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
*   This effect, including increased parasympathetic activity, has been replicated in studies using Waon therapy, particularly in individuals with at least one cardiovascular risk factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

Long-term sauna use has been shown to improve blood pressure, left ventricular function, vascular compliance, and endothelial function—all improvements also observed with physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.

## Broader Health and Longevity Benefits
Beyond cardiovascular health, sauna use has broader implications for health span and longevity.

### All-Cause Mortality and Age-Related Diseases
The Kuopio study also examined all-cause mortality:
*   Men using the sauna 2-3 times a week had a 27% lower risk of all-cause mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.
*   This risk dropped by 40% for those using it 4-7 times a week compared to once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

[[Sauna use and depression | Sauna use]] has also been linked to a lower risk of age-related diseases like Alzheimer's disease and dementia, potentially due to improved vascular health and other mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>:
*   2-3 times a week use showed a 20% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.
*   4-7 times a week use showed a 60% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.

### Role of Heat Shock Proteins
One key mechanism is the increase in heat shock proteins, a family of chaperone proteins evolutionarily conserved across species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. Heat is one of the most robust ways to increase their expression and activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>.

Heat shock proteins are vital for:
*   Maintaining the proper 3-dimensional structure of proteins within cells, essential for their function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>.
*   Preventing the aggregation of damaged proteins, which can form plaques and play a causal role in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's, alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's) and some cardiovascular diseases (e.g., atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathy, heart failure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>.
*   Slowing muscular atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>. A recent study showed that individuals exposed to heat during two weeks of leg immobilization had 37% less muscle atrophy compared to a sham control group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

Heat shock proteins also play a role in human longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>. Individuals with a specific functional single nucleotide polymorphism in the heat shock protein 70 gene, which makes the chaperone protein more efficient, live longer on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>. For those without this genetic advantage, sauna use is a way to increase heat shock proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>. Healthy individuals sitting in a dry sauna at 163°F (73°C) for 30 minutes can increase their heat shock proteins by 50%, with levels remaining elevated for about 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>. Heat-acclimated individuals (frequent sauna users or physically active people) show a sooner and more robust heat shock protein response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>.

### Lowering Inflammation
Sauna use can improve overall longevity by lowering inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>. Inflammation plays a major role in aging and age-related diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>. Sauna bathing has consistently been shown to:
*   Lower C-reactive protein in a dose-dependent manner (more frequent and longer duration, the more robust the effect) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>.
*   Increase anti-inflammatory biomarkers like IL-10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>. These effects are consistent with those of physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>.

## Additional Benefits
*   **Brain Function and Mood**: Sauna improves brain function and increases endorphins, similar to physical activity, leading to a mood-enhancing effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. One randomized controlled trial showed that a single exposure to elevated core body temperature had an antidepressant effect lasting weeks in people with major depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:00">[23:14:00]</a>.
*   **Detoxification**: Certain heavy metals like mercury and cadmium are better excreted through sweat than through urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>.

## Safety and Practical Advice
Sauna use is generally safe for healthy individuals and those with stable cardiac disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>.

### Compliance
Sauna presents a more appealing option for individuals who are sedentary and find it difficult to engage in physical activity, as it is perceived as a "spa treatment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>. Unbeknownst to them, sitting in a sauna mimics moderate aerobic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:56:00">[24:56:00]</a>.

### Hydration
It is crucial to rehydrate after a sauna session, as a person typically loses about 0.5 kilograms of sweat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>.

### Contraindications
*   **Alcohol**: Never consume alcohol before or during sauna use, as it has been linked to deaths in case reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>.
*   **Low Blood Pressure**: Elderly people prone to low blood pressure should be cautious due to sauna's significant blood pressure-lowering effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>.
*   **Recent Myocardial Infarction and Certain Heart Conditions**: Recent myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and severe aortic stenosis are also contraindications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>.

### Duration and Acclimation
While 20 minutes is a key duration for the studies mentioned, individuals new to sauna use can start with shorter durations (e.g., 5 minutes) and gradually increase as they acclimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>. In Finland, people often break up their sauna sessions by cooling off (e.g., jumping in cold water or resting at room temperature) before re-entering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>.

### Finnish vs. Infrared Saunas
For home use, a Finnish sauna is personally preferred by Dr. Patrick due to its higher heat and humidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>. Infrared saunas, though convenient, cheaper, and less of a fire hazard, typically require longer durations to achieve similar physiological effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>.

### Additive Effects with Other Health Practices
There is evidence for an [[Benefits of sauna combined with exercise | additive effect]] between physical activity and sauna use, leading to improved mitochondrial function in muscle tissue that is more pronounced in physically active individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:45:00">[27:45:00]</a>. While there is no direct data proving an additive effect with fasting or time-restricted eating, these practices affect different molecular mechanisms and pathways important for healthy aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:00">[28:44:00]</a>.

### Alternatives to Sauna
Other modalities for increasing core body temperature include steam showers and hot baths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:11:00">[33:11:00]</a>. Hot baths have shown similar effects to dry saunas on the endocrine system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a>. For optimal heat stress benefits, it's best to stay submerged in water during a hot bath rather than cooling off parts of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[33:42:00]</a>.

### Age Limit
In Finland, children use saunas but for much shorter durations (e.g., 5 minutes) compared to adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:35:00">[34:35:00]</a>. More resources on special populations (elderly, children, pregnant individuals) and heart conditions can be found on Dr. Patrick's website, *foundmyfitness.com* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.

## Other Tools for Improving Health Span
Beyond sauna, other practices that offer significant health span benefits include:
*   **Time-Restricted Eating**: Eating all food within a specific window (e.g., 6-11 hours) and fasting for the remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>. This is often easier for people to adopt than complete dietary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>. It activates stress response pathways that aid in dealing with aging stresses, such as clearing cellular debris and dysfunctional organelles (like mitochondria), leading to cellular rejuvenation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:33:00">[37:33:00]</a>. It also leverages the body's peak insulin sensitivity in the morning, aligning food intake with circadian rhythms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:10:00">[38:10:00]</a>.
*   **Prolonged Fasting**: Fasting for at least 48 hours, as researched by Dr. Valter Longo, can activate molecular pathways similar to those triggered by a fasting-mimicking diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[39:30:00]</a>.
    *   Studies have shown benefits for autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>.
    *   Pilot studies suggest a 48-hour water fast is safe and may sensitize cancer cells to death while protecting normal cells from chemotherapy/radiation toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>. This occurs because normal cells activate stress response pathways during fasting, becoming more resilient, while cancer cells, with their mutations, are unable to do so and die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[41:10:00]</a>.
    *   In animal studies, prolonged fasting causes organs to shrink due to the death of damaged old cells, followed by a refeeding phase that triggers stem cell proliferation, replacing lost cells with healthy new ones, leading to an "amazing rejuvenation process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:36:00">[42:36:00]</a>. This has implications for autoimmune diseases, as dysfunctional immune cells are preferentially killed and replaced by healthy ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>.
*   **Broccoli Sprouts**: Mentioned as another important way to improve health span <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:18:00">[44:18:00]</a>.

Caloric Restriction Mimetics (CRMs), also referred to as fasting mimetics, are compounds that induce similar biochemical changes in cells as starvation or [[Caloric restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | fasting]] would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. They aim to achieve the health benefits associated with [[caloric_restriction_intermittent_fasting_and_their_biological_effects | caloric restriction]] or [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | fasting]] without requiring strict dietary adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Action

CRMs primarily induce autophagy by stimulating deacetylation reactions in cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. This process occurs through a final common pathway of protein hypoacetylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. The cytosolic pool of Acetyl-CoA is a central metabolite that determines the level of protein acetylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. A reduction in Acetyl-CoA in the cytosol causes deacetylation of cellular proteins, leading to a multi-pronged induction of major subpathways of the autophagic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

CRMs can achieve this deacetylation in three main ways:

1.  **Inhibition of Acetyl-CoA Generation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>:
    *   The enzyme ATP citrate lyase is crucial for generating cytosolic Acetyl-CoA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.
    *   Pharmacological compounds or substances that inhibit this enzyme cause Acetyl-CoA depletion, deacetylation, and autophagy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
2.  **Inhibition of Protein Acetyltransferases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>:
    *   These enzymes transfer acetyl moieties from Acetyl-CoA to lysine residues in proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   Specific inhibitors of acetyltransferases, such as EP300, which is important for autophagy regulation, can cause deacetylation and autophagy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>.
3.  **Activation of Deacetylases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>:
    *   These enzymes remove acetyl groups from proteins, leading to hypoacetylation and autophagy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.

As a side effect of deacetylation reactions, inhibition of mTOR and activation of AMP Kinase are usually observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. These pathways are connected and contribute to the overall autophagic response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Examples of Fasting and Caloric Restriction Mimetics

### Hydroxycitrate
Hydroxycitrate inhibits ATP citrate lyase, leading to Acetyl-CoA depletion, deacetylation, and autophagy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

### Spermidine
Spermidine is a natural compound found in the nuclei of various cells, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>. It is particularly abundant in fermented foods like natto, durian fruit, and fermented cheese, and contributes to their distinctive smells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>. Spermidine can also be produced by the human microbiota in the intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.

Spermidine induces autophagy by inhibiting protein acetyltransferases like EP300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>. Studies in mice have shown that spermidine can be taken up via food or drinking water and induces autophagy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. It has also been shown to reduce weight gain in mice on high-fat diets, though the precise autophagy-dependent mechanisms are still being elucidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>. Specific bacterial strains that overproduce polyamines, including spermidine, have been linked to reducing the development of colon cancer and aging in studies by a Japanese group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

### Resveratrol
Resveratrol, a compound found in red wine, induces autophagy by activating deacetylases, which remove acetyl groups from proteins and cause hypoacetylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.

### Coffee (Polyphenols)
Coffee, specifically its polyphenols, can induce autophagy independent of caffeine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>. A study in mice showed that a non-toxic dose of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee administered continuously in drinking water magnificently induced autophagy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. Heavy coffee consumption has been linked to major health-promoting effects, including a reduction in most cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

## Applications and Benefits

### Autophagy Induction
CRMs are designed to induce autophagy, a cellular process of self-digestion and recycling, which is observed in the context of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, adaptation to changing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, and avoidance of cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. By stimulating general autophagy, particularly through activating nutrient sensors like AMP kinase, inhibiting mTOR, or provoking deacetylation, CRMs can increase the cellular demand for self-cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. This allows the autophagic machinery to preferentially sequester and destroy slightly damaged or aging portions of the cell, such as protein aggregates or dysfunctional mitochondria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. This preferential cleaning may explain why autophagy stimulation can act as a mechanism against aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

### Synergy with Cancer Therapies
CRMs, including spermidine, hydroxycitrate, and resveratrol, have been shown to enhance the anti-cancer immune response when combined with chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. This enhancement contributes to the long-term efficacy and durability of the treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.

The mechanism involves the requirement of autophagy for stressed cells to release ATP into the microenvironment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. Extracellular ATP acts as a dangerous signal perceived by purinergic receptors on immune cells, particularly myeloid cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. Autophagy, especially when occurring before cell death, can attract myeloid cells and initiate an immune response against tumor antigens during early oncogenic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. Therefore, autophagy is crucial for certain steps of immunosurveillance, which is decisive for therapeutic outcomes in cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>. Inhibiting autophagy or destroying extracellular ATP can abolish the favorable interaction between CRMs and chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. Similarly, removing T-cells from the system can eliminate tumor growth reduction induced by chemotherapy combined with CRMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.

## Current Research and Future Outlook

While CRMs have shown promise in preclinical models, particularly in mice, human clinical studies in this field are limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>. For instance, it is known that CRMs like spermidine can induce autophagy in mice even with a high-fat diet, but this has not been sufficiently studied in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.

Developing non-invasive, clinically relevant biomarkers for autophagy is an ongoing challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. While methods exist to measure autophagy in circulating white blood cells (leukocytes) by detecting the redistribution of LC3 via immunofluorescence or biosensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, this technology is not yet widely available in standard clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. More work is needed to make such assessments practical for routine clinical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

## Personal Practice of Dr. Guido Kroemer

Dr. Guido Kroemer, a leading expert in autophagy, practices a regimen that incorporates elements of [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | fasting]] and CRMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>. He typically eats one meal per day, which is dinner, and includes cheese and wine, leveraging the spermidine content in cheese and resveratrol in wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. He notes that inhibiting acetyltransferase (by spermidine) and activating deacetylase (by resveratrol) would have a synergistic effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. Additionally, he practices prolonged [[Calorie restriction and fasting as interventions for aging | fasting]] twice a year for five days without food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>, and also engages in exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>. During non-eating periods, he drinks coffee, recognizing the autophagy-inducing polyphenols in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.

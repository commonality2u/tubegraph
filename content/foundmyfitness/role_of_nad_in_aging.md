Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) is a crucial molecule in the field of aging, with its related precursor molecules, nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), often referred to as NAD boosters [00:00:06]. NAD is considered one of the most important molecules, as life would cease to exist without it [00:00:25].

## NAD Levels and Aging

[[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels decrease with age]] [00:01:14]. This decline across various tissues is associated with many hallmarks of aging, including:
*   Loss of proteostasis [00:01:25]
*   [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_its_role_in_cellular_aging | Mitochondrial dysfunction]] [00:01:27]
*   Glucose intolerance [00:01:29]
*   Insulin insensitivity [00:01:32]
*   Cellular senescence [00:01:32]
*   Altered epigenetics [00:01:34]

### Why NAD Decreases with Age
The complete reason for NAD decline with age is still an open question, but known factors include:
*   Chronic [[role_of_inflammation_in_aging | inflammation]] and immune activation, which consume NAD, tend to increase with age [00:02:20].
*   An increased need for DNA repair [00:02:28] places an immense demand on the NAD pool [00:02:30].
*   The body's ability to produce and recycle NAD decreases with age [00:02:33].

## [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | NAD's Involvement in Energy Metabolism and DNA Repair]]

NAD plays a critical role in energy metabolism, as it is essential for producing energy [00:03:38]. It participates in redox reactions crucial for the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids, and the formation of ATP [00:03:45]. Both oxidized (NAD) and reduced (NADH) forms are vital, requiring cells to maintain massive concentrations of both [00:04:05].

NAD also acts as a cofactor for many enzymes, meaning it binds to and activates them to perform their functions [00:04:23]. Several NAD-required enzymes are found inside the mitochondria, contributing to energy generation [00:04:38]. NAD also acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy production from glucose outside the mitochondria, a process known as glycolysis [00:04:49]. For instance, red blood cells, which lack mitochondria, rely solely on glycolysis for energy, with NAD playing a key role [00:05:01].

### DNA Damage Mitigation
NAD is essential for repairing DNA damage [00:05:14] as it is a cofactor for PARP1, one of the most important enzymes in DNA repair [00:05:19]. Excessive DNA damage and subsequent PARP1 activation can significantly decrease NAD levels to 20-30% of normal [00:05:27].

The ability to repair DNA damage is critical for longevity [00:05:38]. Centenarians have significantly higher PARP1 activity than younger individuals [00:05:43]. PARP1 activity has also been correlated with maximum lifespan in mammals, with higher activity linked to longer lifespans [00:05:55]. This suggests that genomic stability, which relies on NAD and PARP1, is very important for longevity [00:06:18].

### Sirtuin Activation
NAD is required to activate sirtuins, a family of highly conserved enzymes involved in health span and longevity across multiple organisms [00:06:27]. Sirtuins regulate various metabolic processes, including stress response and lifespan modulation, primarily through epigenetic regulation [00:06:36]. They use NAD to remove acetyl groups from cellular proteins, controlling gene activation related to:
*   Energy metabolism [00:06:55]
*   [[role_of_autophagy_in_aging_and_agerelated_diseases | Autophagy]] [00:06:57]
*   Circadian rhythm [00:06:58]
*   DNA repair [00:07:00]
*   Cell survival [00:07:00]

When cellular energy levels are low (e.g., during exercise, fasting, or caloric restriction), NAD levels and the NAD to NADH ratio rise, activating sirtuin expression and activity [00:07:04]. Resveratrol, a compound found in red grapes, is a potent sirtuin-activating compound thought to contribute to its beneficial effects on health span [00:07:23].

## [[effects_of_nad_decline_with_age | Effects of NAD Decline with Age]]

As NAD becomes depleted across various tissues like the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart—which have high metabolic demands—these tissues may not function properly [00:07:40]. [[effects_of_nad_decline_with_age | NAD depletion has been associated with hallmarks of aging]], such as:
*   Decreased [[role_of_autophagy_in_aging_and_agerelated_diseases | autophagy]] [00:08:03]
*   Increased DNA damage [00:08:08]
*   Increased [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_its_role_in_cellular_aging | mitochondrial dysfunction]] [00:08:10]
*   Dysregulated metabolism [00:08:11]

NAD depletion may predispose organisms to a variety of age-related diseases, including:
*   Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) [00:08:18]
*   Cardiovascular disease [00:08:22]
*   Muscle atrophy [00:08:24]
*   Increased susceptibility to infections due to the immune system's high NAD requirement [00:08:27]

## Boosting NAD Levels

NAD levels naturally increase under conditions that promote health span, such as exercise, fasting, and lifelong caloric restriction [00:08:34]. NAD restoration through various methods has been shown to increase lifespan in lower-level organisms (yeast, worms) and rodents [00:08:50].

### Dietary Sources and Recycling
NAD can be synthesized in the body from dietary sources like:
*   The amino acid tryptophan (found in salmon, spinach, nuts) [00:02:51]
*   Three forms of niacin (vitamin B3), including nicotinamide (niacinamide), nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide riboside (found in lean meats, legumes, veggies) [00:02:59]

However, dietary sources are not the major source of NAD, as the body's demand far exceeds what can be consumed [00:03:17]. The primary source of NAD is a recycling mechanism called the NAD salvage pathway [00:03:22]. This pathway converts nicotinamide (a byproduct of NAD consumption) into nicotinamide mononucleotide and then into NAD [00:10:07].

There are two important considerations for the salvage pathway:
1.  Nicotinamide has been shown to inhibit sirtuin activity, which is not beneficial for longevity [00:10:33].
2.  The enzyme that converts nicotinamide into nicotinamide mononucleotide is subject to feedback inhibition by NAD levels [00:10:46]. This means that above a certain NAD concentration, nicotinamide will not be further converted to NAD, remaining as nicotinamide, which can inhibit sirtuins [00:10:52].

### NAD Boosters: Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)
NR and NMN are found in low concentrations in many foods and are also available as supplements [00:11:29]. These are called [[effects_of_nad_boosters_and_their_impact_on_aging | NAD boosters]] because, in supplement form, they have been shown to be well tolerated at high doses and can effectively raise NAD levels, ameliorating age-associated diseases in rodents [00:11:38].

#### Animal Studies
*   **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)**:
    *   Oral administration at high doses can counteract an obesogenic diet by improving insulin sensitivity [00:12:01].
    *   It can improve endurance and strength [00:12:09].
    *   High doses can reverse [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_its_role_in_cellular_aging | mitochondrial damage]], increase mitochondrial biogenesis, and reverse muscular atrophy [00:12:12].
    *   Positive effects on the brain include increased neurogenesis, decreased cognitive deterioration, reduced amyloid beta production, and increased synaptic plasticity [00:12:24].
*   **Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)**:
    *   High-dose injection can counteract an obesogenic diet and improve metabolic health markers [00:12:48].
    *   High-dose injection can improve heart function and cognition/memory in animals with neurodegenerative disease [00:12:59].
    *   Long-term dietary administration of NMN mitigated age-associated physiological decline in mice, showing improved skeletal muscle function, [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_its_role_in_cellular_aging | mitochondrial function]], increased energy expenditure, increased bone density, and decreased insulin resistance [00:13:10]. These benefits were dose-dependent [00:13:41].

#### [[potential_health_benefits_and_risks_of_nad_supplementation | Potential Risks: Cancer]]
A recent study showed that NMN could accelerate cancer growth in mice with a specific type of pancreatic cancer where pro-inflammatory senescent cells drive tumor growth [00:14:03]. Injected NMN significantly increased precancerous and cancerous lesions [00:14:15]. This effect is linked to senescent cells, which secrete pro-inflammatory molecules and promote growth signaling, with NAD potentially making these senescent cells more tumorigenic [00:14:31]. While this study focused on NMN and a specific cancer type, it is possible NR could show similar results [00:15:24]. Long-term animal studies are needed to confirm these findings [00:15:52].

#### Dosage Translation and Bioavailability
Translating animal study doses to humans is complex.
*   **NR**: Many rodent studies used very high oral doses (400 mg/kg body weight), which translates to a human equivalent of approximately 2.6 grams per day for a 180-pound person [00:16:17]. This is higher than doses clinically tested in humans [00:16:48].
*   **NMN**: Most animal studies used high injected doses (around 500 mg/kg body weight), which is hard to translate [00:16:54]. Oral doses used in long-term aging studies (100-300 mg/kg body weight) translate to 653 mg to 2 grams per day for a 180-pound person, with higher benefits at the higher dose [00:17:10].

A key concern is whether NR or NMN can reach other tissues intact and directly form NAD without going through the salvage pathway, which is subject to feedback inhibition [00:18:01].
*   Isotope tracer studies in animals showed that at low oral doses (50 mg/kg body weight), NR and NMN produced very low levels of directly made NAD only in the liver, with negligible levels in kidneys, muscles, or the brain [00:19:11].
*   Higher oral doses of NR (200 mg/kg) showed no difference in direct NAD formation outside the liver but increased salvage pathway-derived NAD in kidneys, muscle, and brain [00:20:08].
*   Intravenously administered NR or NMN produced directly formed NAD in the liver, kidney, and muscle in a dose-dependent manner [00:20:51]. However, only salvage-derived NAD was detected in the brain, suggesting neither NR nor NMN directly cross the blood-brain barrier [00:21:09].

This data suggests that even at high oral doses, NR and NMN might primarily be converted to nicotinamide, which is then transported to other tissues and forms NAD via the salvage pathway [00:21:42]. However, very high oral doses might still be beneficial due to sufficient NAD levels from the salvage pathway [00:22:50]. Intravenous administration seems to allow direct NAD formation in multiple tissues, bypassing feedback inhibition and leading to higher NAD concentrations [00:23:00].

### Direct NAD Administration
NAD itself has poor oral bioavailability, primarily being digested into nicotinamide and its precursors before absorption [00:24:06]. While intravenous NAD infusion may bypass digestion, no mammalian NAD transporter has been identified, and extracellular NAD is not widely taken up by tissues [00:24:34]. However, injected NAD has been shown to raise NAD levels in some brain regions and the heart, offering protection against cardiac hypertrophy [00:24:44].

## Human Clinical Data

There is currently no published evidence of oral NMN supplementation in humans [00:25:50]. However, two randomized placebo-controlled trials have shown that oral NR can increase NAD levels in white blood cells in a dose-dependent manner [00:25:54].

*   **Study 1**: An 8-week study with 120 healthy adults (60-80 years old) [00:26:04].
    *   A 250 mg daily dose of NR combined with pterostilbene (a sirtuin activator) increased whole blood NAD levels by 40% after 4 weeks [00:26:16].
    *   A 500 mg double dose increased NAD levels by 90% [00:26:35].
    *   The lower dose group showed reduced diastolic blood pressure and lower levels of liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (a marker of liver damage) [00:26:41]. It's difficult to determine if NR, pterostilbene, or both were responsible for these effects [00:26:51].
*   **Study 2**: A 6-week study with 60 middle-aged and older adults (55-79 years old) [00:27:03].
    *   A 500 mg dose of NR twice daily (1 gram total) was well tolerated and increased NAD levels in white blood cells by 60% [00:27:13].
    *   Participants experienced non-statistically significant improvements in blood pressure and aortic stiffness, possibly due to dose size or small sample size [00:27:26].
    *   NR had no effects on metabolic function, motor function, or exercise capacity [00:27:39].

These human studies indicate that oral NR can raise NAD levels in whole blood and white blood cells, but the highest dose tested (1 gram per day) is still significantly lower than the human equivalent doses that showed benefits in animal studies [00:27:51]. Long-term safety studies in humans are still needed [00:28:23].

## Supplement Stability

NR and NMN can break down into nicotinamide over time, especially in high humidity or heat [00:28:27]. This is a concern because supplemental nicotinamide may reduce sirtuin activation [00:28:36]. Keeping these supplements cold helps maintain stability, and ensuring they come from a reputable manufacturer can minimize degradation [00:28:42].

## Conclusion

NAD is vital for survival, primarily obtained through recycling [00:29:01]. Normal aging and daily living can cause [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels to decline]], leading to metabolic and [[mitochondrial_dysfunction_and_its_role_in_cellular_aging | mitochondrial dysfunction]], increased DNA damage, and other age-related problems [00:29:10]. [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels can be increased]] through lifestyle factors like exercise or fasting, and by NAD boosters such as NR and NMN [00:29:22].

While animal studies on [[effects_of_nad_boosters_and_their_impact_on_aging | NAD boosters]] show promising health benefits, including mitigating age-related decline, [[potential_health_benefits_and_risks_of_nad_supplementation | concerns remain]], particularly regarding potential acceleration of cancer growth in specific contexts [00:29:31]. The data from human studies is limited, primarily showing NR's ability to raise NAD levels in white blood cells [00:29:35]. Much more research is needed to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of NAD boosters in humans [00:29:39].

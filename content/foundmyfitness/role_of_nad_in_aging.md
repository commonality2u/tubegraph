Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a crucial molecule for life, so essential that without it, life would cease to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In recent years, NAD and its precursor molecules, such as nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), have become highly relevant to the field of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These precursors are often referred to as NAD boosters and are available as consumer supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## NAD Levels and Aging

One of the primary reasons for the interest in NAD is that its levels decrease with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This decline across multiple tissue types is associated with many [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | hallmarks of aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These hallmarks include:
*   Loss of proteostasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   [[Mitochondrial dysfunction and aging | Mitochondrial dysfunction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   Glucose intolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Insulin insensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   [[Cellular senescence and its role in aging | Cellular senescence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   [[Role of epigenetics in aging | Altered epigenetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

When NAD levels decline, tissues like the brain, immune cells, and muscle tissue, which require NAD for energy, may not function properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Why NAD Levels Decrease with Age

The exact reason why NAD levels decrease with age is still an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. However, some contributing factors are known:
*   **Increased Consumption**: Chronic inflammation and immune activation, which consume NAD, tend to increase with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The increased need for [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | DNA repair]] due to age also places immense demand on the NAD pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Decreased Production/Recycling**: The body's ability to produce and recycle NAD also declines with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Multifaceted Roles of NAD

NAD plays multiple critical roles in cellular function and health:

### Energy Metabolism
NAD is central to [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism and_dna_repair | energy metabolism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. It participates in redox reactions, alternating between its oxidized (NAD+) and reduced (NADH) forms, which are crucial for the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids and the formation of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Cells need to maintain massive concentrations of both NAD+ and NADH for these linked reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. NAD also acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy production inside and outside the mitochondria, such as in glycolysis, which is the primary energy source for cells like red blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### DNA Repair
NAD is vital for mitigating [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | DNA damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It is a cofactor for PARP1, a crucial enzyme involved in repairing DNA damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Excessive DNA damage and subsequent PARP1 activation can significantly decrease NAD levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The ability to repair DNA damage is important for longevity; centenarians have higher PARP1 activity than younger individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Higher PARP1 activity has been correlated with maximum lifespan in mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Sirtuin Activation
NAD is required to activate sirtuins, a family of enzymes involved in longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Sirtuins are highly conserved and play roles in healthspan and longevity in various organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. They regulate metabolic processes, stress response, and modulate lifespan through [[role_of_epigenetics_in_aging | epigenetic regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Sirtuins use NAD to remove acetyl groups from cellular proteins, controlling the activation of genes involved in [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism and_dna_repair | energy metabolism]], [[role_of_autophagy in_aging_and_disease | autophagy]], circadian rhythm, and cell survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. When cellular energy levels are low (e.g., during exercise, fasting, or caloric restriction), NAD levels rise, signaling sirtuin activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Consequences of NAD Depletion

NAD depletion is associated with multiple [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | hallmarks of aging]], including decreased [[role_of_autophagy in_aging_and_disease | autophagy]], increased [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | DNA damage]], [[Mitochondrial dysfunction and aging | mitochondrial dysfunction]], and dysregulated metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This depletion may predispose organisms to various [[effects_of_nad_levels_on_agerelated_diseases | age-related diseases]], such as:
*   Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>
*   Cardiovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>
*   Muscle atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>
*   Increased susceptibility to infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>

## Boosting NAD Levels

NAD levels can be influenced by lifestyle factors and supplementation.

### Lifestyle and Diet
NAD levels naturally increase under conditions that promote healthspan, such as exercise, fasting, and caloric restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. NAD can be synthesized in the body from dietary sources like the amino acid tryptophan (found in salmon, spinach, nuts) and three forms of niacin (vitamin B3), including nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide riboside (found in lean meats, legumes, veggies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### The NAD Salvage Pathway
Dietary sources are not the major source of NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The body requires such large quantities of NAD that it would be impossible to consume enough from the diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The primary source of NAD is through a recycling mechanism called the NAD salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This pathway converts nicotinamide (a byproduct of NAD consumption) back into nicotinamide mononucleotide and then into NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

However, there are important considerations for the salvage pathway:
*   Nicotinamide has been shown to inhibit sirtuin activity, which is undesirable for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   The enzyme that converts nicotinamide into nicotinamide mononucleotide is subject to feedback inhibition by NAD levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This means that at a certain concentration of NAD, nicotinamide will no longer be converted to NAD, potentially leading to an accumulation of nicotinamide that inhibits sirtuins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_nad_boosting_supplements | NAD Boosting Supplements]]

Nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) are popular as NAD boosters because they can be converted into NAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. They are found in low concentrations in foods but are also available as supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

#### Animal Studies on NAD Boosters
*   **NR and NMN**: At very high doses, these precursors have been shown in animal studies to improve the aging of multiple tissues and cell types, including the heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and stem cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)**: Studies show NR can counteract obesogenic diets by improving insulin sensitivity, improve endurance and strength, reverse [[Mitochondrial dysfunction and aging | mitochondrial damage]], increase mitochondrial biogenesis, and reverse muscular atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. In the brain, NR has increased neurogenesis, decreased cognitive deterioration, reduced amyloid-beta production, and increased synaptic plasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)**: Injections of high-dose NMN have countered obesogenic diets, improved metabolic health markers, improved heart function, and enhanced cognition and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Long-term dietary administration of NMN mitigated age-associated physiological decline in mice, improving skeletal muscle and [[Mitochondrial dysfunction and aging | mitochondrial function]], increasing energy expenditure and bone density, and decreasing insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

#### Potential Concerns: Cancer and Senescence
A recent study showed that NMN accelerated cancer growth in mice with a specific type of pancreatic cancer where pro-inflammatory [[cellular_senescence and_its_role_in_aging | senescent cells]] drive tumor growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. This effect was dependent on senescent cells, which can disrupt normal tissue functions and contribute to cancer progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. NAD appears to increase the tumorigenic quality of these senescent cells, likely due to its role in energy metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. While this doesn't mean NR or NMN supplementation causes cancer generally, it highlights the need for long-term animal studies to confirm safety in diverse contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

#### Dose Translation and Bioavailability
Translating animal study doses to humans presents challenges. Many rodent studies used very high oral doses of NR (e.g., 400 mg/kg body weight), which translates to approximately 2.6 grams per day for a 180-pound person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. NMN animal studies often used even higher doses (500 mg/kg body weight), typically injected, making direct translation difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

Bioavailability is another concern. Oral NR or NMN may not directly reach other tissues intact to form NAD, appearing to be mostly transported to the liver at lower doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Instead, they may be converted into nicotinamide, which is then transported to other tissues and subsequently converted into NAD via the salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This is significant because NAD produced from the salvage pathway is subject to feedback inhibition, limiting how high NAD levels can be raised in tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Intravenous administration of NR or NMN has shown more direct NAD production in liver, kidney, and muscle in a dose-dependent manner, but not in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

### Direct NAD Administration
Taking or injecting NAD directly is also challenging due to its poor oral bioavailability; it is primarily digested into precursors like nicotinamide before absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. While intravenous NAD infusion may bypass digestion, no mammalian NAD transporter has been identified, and extracellular NAD is not consistently taken up into tissues except possibly the brain and heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. High-dose injected NAD has shown increased NAD levels in some brain regions and the heart, offering protection against cardiac hypertrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

## Human Clinical Data

As of the transcript's date, there is no published evidence of oral NMN supplementation in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. However, two randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that oral nicotinamide riboside can increase NAD levels in white blood cells in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

*   One 8-week study involving 120 healthy adults (60-80 years old) showed that 250 mg daily of NR and pterostilbene (a sirtuin activator) increased whole blood NAD levels by 40% in 4 weeks, and 500 mg increased it by 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. The lower dose also showed reduced diastolic blood pressure and lower liver enzyme levels, though it's unclear if this was due to NR, pterostilbene, or both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   Another trial with 60 middle-aged and older adults (55-79 years old) demonstrated that 1 gram of NR per day (500 mg twice daily) for six weeks was well-tolerated and increased NAD levels in white blood cells by 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. This study saw non-statistically significant improvements in blood pressure and aortic stiffness, but no effects on metabolic function, motor function, or exercise capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

The highest dose tested in humans thus far is 1 gram per day, which is significantly lower than the human equivalent doses (around 2.6 grams/day) that showed benefits in animal studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. While short-term clinical studies indicate oral NR is safe, no long-term human studies have been conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

> [!caution] Storage of Supplements
> NR and NMN can break down into nicotinamide over time, especially in high humidity or heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. This is problematic because supplemental nicotinamide may reduce sirtuin activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. It's recommended to keep these supplements cold and ensure they come from a reputable manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

NAD is indispensable for survival, playing critical roles in [[nad_and_its_role_in_energy_metabolism and_dna_repair | energy metabolism]], [[role_of_dna_damage_and_repair_in_aging | DNA repair]], and [[nad_levels_aging_and_sirtuin_activity | sirtuin activation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Its decline with age contributes to metabolic and [[Mitochondrial dysfunction and aging | mitochondrial dysfunction]], increased DNA damage, and other problems associated with aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. While lifestyle factors like exercise and fasting can increase NAD, [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_nad_boosting_supplements | NAD boosters]] like NR and NMN show promise, predominantly in animal studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. The long-term efficacy and safety of these supplements in humans remain open questions, necessitating further research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

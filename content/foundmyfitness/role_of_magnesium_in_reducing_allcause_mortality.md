Magnesium is identified as a "low hanging fruit" and an easy, immediate action individuals can take to reduce their risk of age-related diseases and improve overall health [00:20, 01:38, 08:26]. It is considered an essential mineral [08:35].

## Prevalence of Magnesium Inadequacy
Approximately 50% of the U.S. population does not achieve adequate [[importance_of_magnesium_in_the_diet | magnesium]] intake [08:38, 08:45]. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for an adult is, on average, about 400 milligrams per day [08:51, 08:54]. Physically active adults, especially those who exercise frequently or use saunas, may excrete [[magnesium_deficiency_and_its_health_implications | magnesium]] through sweat and consequently require 10% to 20% more than the RDA [09:04, 09:11, 09:15].

## Biological Functions
[[magnesiums_role_in_metabolic_processes_and_aging | Magnesium]] serves as an essential cofactor for over 300 different enzymes in the human body [09:32, 09:37]. These enzymes are crucial for various processes, including:
*   **DNA Repair:** Enzymes responsible for repairing daily DNA damage require [[magnesiums_role_in_metabolic_processes_and_aging | magnesium]] to function properly [09:38, 10:13]. This repair is vital for preventing dysfunctional cells and oncogenic mutations that can lead to cancer [10:04, 10:08].
*   **DNA Synthesis:** The replication of DNA, necessary for making new cells such as blood, immune, and skin cells, depends on enzymes like DNA polymerases, which require [[magnesiums_role_in_metabolic_processes_and_aging | magnesium]] for proper function [10:18, 10:29, 10:34]. Ensuring genomic stability is crucial for preventing age-related diseases like cancer [11:37, 11:41].

## Impact on Mortality and Disease Prevention
Observational studies, while having potential confounding factors, suggest a strong association between [[magnesiums_impact_on_brain_health_and_aging | magnesium]] levels and mortality rates:
*   Individuals with the highest [[magnesiums_role_in_metabolic_processes_and_aging | magnesium]] levels have a 40% lower all-cause mortality and a 50% lower cancer mortality compared to those with the lowest levels [11:00, 11:05, 11:11].
*   One study indicated that for every 100 milligram decrease in [[importance_of_magnesium_in_the_diet | magnesium]] intake, there was a 24% increase in pancreatic cancer incidence [11:14, 11:18, 11:25].

This highlights the critical role of [[magnesiums_role_in_metabolic_processes_and_aging | magnesium]] in maintaining DNA integrity and preventing cancer, an age-related disease [11:32, 11:41].

## Dietary Sources and Supplementation
Widespread [[magnesium_deficiency_and_its_health_implications | magnesium deficiency]] is common because modern diets often lack sufficient intake of key [[importance_of_magnesium_in_the_diet | magnesium-rich]] foods [11:54, 11:58].
*   **Dietary Sources:** [[importance_of_magnesium_in_the_diet | Magnesium]] is found at the center of the chlorophyll molecule, making dark leafy greens a high source [12:02, 12:07, 12:09]. Other good sources include legumes, almonds, and oats [12:16, 12:19, 12:22]. Many people do not consume enough of these daily [12:24].
    *   One example for increasing intake is a smoothie with cooked kale, chard, strawberries, blueberries, and avocado for breakfast [12:47, 12:52, 12:53, 12:57].
*   **Supplemental Magnesium:** [[magnesium_supplements_and_their_effectiveness | Supplemental magnesium]] is another option to reach adequate levels [12:29, 13:35, 13:40].
    *   Common forms with good bioavailability include [[magnesium_supplements_and_their_effectiveness | magnesium]] glycinate, [[magnesium_supplements_and_their_effectiveness | magnesium]] malate, and [[magnesium_supplements_and_their_effectiveness | magnesium]] citrate [13:16, 13:27, 13:30, 13:32, 13:34]. Magnesium dioxide is noted as not very bioavailable [13:23, 13:26].
    *   Higher doses of [[magnesium_supplements_and_their_effectiveness | magnesium]] can cause gastrointestinal problems [12:38, 12:40, 12:43]. A personal example given is taking 125 milligrams of [[magnesium_supplements_and_their_effectiveness | magnesium]] glycinate daily [13:11, 13:16].
    *   Electrolyte drinks can also help replace lost [[magnesiums_role_in_muscle_function_and_cramps | magnesium]] after physical activity or sauna use [13:46, 13:51, 13:52, 13:56].

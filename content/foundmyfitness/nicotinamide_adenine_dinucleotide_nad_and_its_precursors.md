[[NAD and its role in energy metabolism and DNA repair | Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)]] is a crucial molecule found in nearly every life form on Earth, essential for survival alongside ATP and amino acids [00:13:22]. It plays a fundamental role in energy metabolism, including the metabolization of glucose and fatty acids, and is required by mitochondria [00:13:00]. Beyond energy, NAD is vital for activating sirtuins and DNA repair enzymes like PARP [00:13:12].

## Role of NAD in Health and Aging

NAD is considered one of the body's most important molecules, sensed by the body to determine environmental conditions and trigger appropriate survival or growth responses [00:13:22]. Its pathways have existed for over 3 billion years [00:14:20].

### NAD Levels and Aging
[[Role of NAD in aging | NAD levels naturally decrease with age]] [00:15:02]. For instance, a 50-year-old might have half the NAD levels of a 20-year-old [00:15:06]. This decline is hypothesized to play a causal role in the aging process [00:14:40]. As NAD levels fall, the effectiveness of sirtuins — enzymes that repair the body and maintain cellular health — is reduced, making the body less efficient at self-repair and energy production [00:15:10].

Furthermore, activated immune cells and the DNA repair process (via PARPs) are significant drains on NAD. As people age and accumulate more DNA damage and inflammation, this creates a negative feedback loop where more NAD is consumed, exacerbating its decline [00:17:26]. This can lead to mitochondrial decay and a loss of cellular identity [00:16:55].

### Regulation of NAD Levels
NAD levels fluctuate significantly depending on diet, exercise, and circadian rhythms [00:11:17]. They tend to rise during the day and fall after large meals [00:11:28]. Exercise and fasting are beneficial because they trigger longevity genes, including sirtuins, which depend on NAD for their function [01:39]. Low insulin and IGF-1 levels, often resulting from calorie restriction or intermittent fasting, also stimulate sirtuin production, linking these metabolic pathways to NAD and longevity [00:09:32]. Interestingly, NAD itself drives the circadian clock, rather than being merely regulated by it [00:12:29].

## NAD Precursors: Boosting NAD Levels

To counteract the age-related decline in NAD, researchers investigate NAD precursors, often referred to as "NAD boosters" [00:11:11]. The body constantly recycles NAD through the salvage pathway, which starts with nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3 [00:36:59].

### [[Nicotinamide Riboside and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide as NAD Boosters | Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)]]
NMN is an immediate precursor to NAD [00:37:54]. When ingested, NMN is taken up by a specific transporter and converted into NAD within the cell in a single step, which locks it inside as a larger molecule [00:37:56]. This conversion step is carried out by an enzyme called NAMPT, which increases in activity under stress and calorie restriction [00:38:17].

In animal studies, NMN has shown remarkable effects:
*   Raises NAD levels in mice [00:39:20].
*   Increases endurance [00:55:45].
*   Improves memory and slows the advancement of Alzheimer's-like conditions [00:51:02].
*   Helps restore blood flow and regrow the vascular system in muscle, with early results suggesting similar benefits in the brain [00:51:33].
*   Delayed tissue aging in multiple organs in normal mice [00:59:36].
*   Preliminary lifespan studies in mice show significantly different outcomes for NMN-treated groups, with improvements in frailty and heart function [01:00:16].

NMN is generally more expensive and harder to synthesize than NR [01:01:23]. It is sensitive to light, heat, and humidity, and should be kept cold (freezer or fridge) to prevent degradation into nicotinamide, which can inhibit sirtuins and DNA repair [00:57:55]. David Sinclair personally takes about a gram of NMN every morning, finding it provides a physiological boost and helps with jet lag or lack of sleep [01:04:22].

### [[Nicotinamide Riboside and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide as NAD Boosters | Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)]]
NR is a smaller molecule than NMN, lacking a phosphate group [00:39:01]. When taken, the body must first add a phosphate to convert it to NMN, and then link two molecules to form NAD [00:39:04]. Both NR and NMN have been shown to raise NAD levels in animals and humans [00:39:20].

However, some studies suggest differences in their efficacy:
*   In head-to-head animal studies, NMN has been shown to increase endurance, while NR did not at comparable doses [00:55:45].
*   One study found that only NMN was effective in a mitochondrial disease model in animals where NAD boosts were crucial [00:56:09].
*   Clinical trials with NR have had mixed results. While they raised NAD levels, a high dose (1,000 mg/day) did not show statistically significant improvements in endurance or other endpoints, although it did show a trending improvement in the vascular system [00:54:31]. This particular study also reported side effects like rashes and flushing [01:01:02]. It's speculated that some NR studies may have used doses below the body's clearance threshold [00:53:40].

Similar to NMN, NR supplements should be stored in cold, dark conditions due to their instability and potential degradation into nicotinamide, which can inhibit sirtuins [00:57:55].

### Future Directions for NAD Boosters
Researchers are developing "super NAD boosters" — timed-release prodrugs that are significantly more effective than current NMN or NR formulations [00:56:47]. These advanced molecules aim to treat conditions like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's by increasing NAD levels. Clinical trials are underway for these new compounds, with early safety studies and forthcoming phase two studies investigating effects on muscle strength and endurance in humans [00:57:04].

## Connections to Other Longevity Pathways
The increase in NAD levels during fasting and exercise is critical because it stimulates sirtuins, which are key [[NAD levels aging and sirtuin activity | longevity genes]] [00:01:44]. These sirtuins, first identified in yeast and worms, are present in almost all life forms and are responsible for repairing the body and slowing aging [00:01:34].

The relationship between NAD, sirtuins, and the aging process is further highlighted by the [[effects_of_nad_levels_on_agerelated_diseases | information theory of aging]], which suggests that aging is a loss of information regulation over time, particularly related to the epigenome [00:19:56]. Sirtuins are intimately linked to this epigenetic clock, and restoring NAD levels is a strategy to help cells regain their youthful identity and reset the epigenome [02:08:47].

[[Role of Specific Nutrients in Cellular Function | Resveratrol]], a molecule found in stressed plants like grapes, also activates sirtuins and works synergistically with NAD [00:15:54]. Resveratrol acts as an "accelerator pedal" for sirtuins, making them work faster, while NAD provides the "fuel" [00:15:54]. Resveratrol has shown promising results in animal studies, particularly in preventing [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_nad_boosting_supplements | cardiovascular disease]] and reducing oxidative stress [00:45:55]. It also appears to be important for activating autophagy, a cellular clean-up process, through its effect on sirtuins and protein acetylation [00:49:25]. Dr. Sinclair personally takes a gram of trans-resveratrol daily with fat to aid absorption [00:43:56].

The intricate network of longevity pathways, including sirtuins, AMP kinase (metformin pathway), and mTOR (rapamycin pathway), respond to the body's energetic status, often sensed through molecules like NAD, ATP, and amino acids [00:13:39]. Activating these ancient pathways seems to have profound beneficial effects on health and longevity [00:14:06].

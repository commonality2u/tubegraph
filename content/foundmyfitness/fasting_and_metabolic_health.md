Valter Longo, a Professor of Gerontology and Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California and Director of the Longevity Institute, has made significant contributions to understanding the effects of [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] and other diets on human aging, lifespan, and health span biomarkers, as well as their role in metabolic therapies for human diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">00:00:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">00:00:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">00:00:09</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">00:00:13</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">00:00:19</a>. His work primarily investigates interventions that extend longevity safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">00:01:07</a>.

## Fasting vs. Caloric Restriction

While [[Intermittent fasting | time-restricted eating]] (e.g., eating within a 12-hour window) aligns with circadian rhythms and is important for various [[Dietary practices and metabolic health | metabolic factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">00:00:28</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">00:00:36</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">00:00:42</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">00:00:48</a>, Longo's research distinguishes between [[Caloric restriction intermittent fasting and their biological effects | caloric restriction]] (CR) and periodic [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] or [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | fasting-mimicking diets]] (FMDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">00:01:16</a>.

*   **Caloric Restriction (CR)**: Involves a continuous, permanent restriction of 20% to 30% of daily calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">00:03:04</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">00:03:11</a>. Historical human studies, such as those in Biosphere 2, showed participants became very stressed and thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">00:01:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">00:02:02</a>. Longo aimed to find something equally powerful but more accessible for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">00:02:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">00:02:13</a>.
*   **Periodic Fasting/Fasting-Mimicking Diets (FMDs)**: These are more extreme interventions designed to "trick the system" into thinking it's fasting, orchestrating gene changes to increase protection and turn on [[Fasting and stem cell regeneration | stem cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">00:01:16</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">00:01:23</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">00:03:16</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">00:03:24</a>.

One critical difference is the **refeeding phase**:
> "Most people think of the restriction as what's working, but it turns out, as we've shown in a number of papers, that is the refeeding that is doing most of the work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">00:03:57</a>
This cycle of fasting and refeeding is crucial for processes like regeneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">00:04:16</a>, whereas CR lacks this refeeding component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">00:04:21</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">00:04:25</a>.

## Mechanisms of Fasting's Metabolic Effects

Fasting induces a "shielding" or "protected mode" in normal cells, making them more resistant to various stressors, including chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">00:19:53</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">00:20:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">00:20:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">00:20:25</a>.

### Cellular Processes
*   **Apoptosis (Programmed Cell Death)**: During starvation, the body eliminates unneeded cells through apoptosis. In mice, about 40% of white blood cells are destroyed during a four-day fast, then rebuilt within a few days of refeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">00:05:41</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">00:05:48</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">00:06:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">00:06:10</a>. This is a powerful regeneration program, similar to what occurs after birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">00:06:14</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">00:06:21</a>.
*   **Autophagy**: The clearing away of damaged cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">00:04:56</a>. While autophagy occurs during fasting, the primary mechanism of cell reduction in the immune system is apoptosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">00:05:19</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">00:05:23</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">00:05:48</a>.
*   **Organ Shrinkage and Regeneration**: Prolonged fasting can cause organs like the liver and the immune system to become much smaller, followed by regeneration during refeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">00:06:47</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">00:06:53</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">00:06:57</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">00:14:05</a>. The body itself does the work, with fasting merely signaling the need to kill cells and refeeding signaling the need to rebuild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">00:07:03</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">00:07:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">00:07:13</a>.

### Metabolic Shift
*   **Ketosis**: By day two of an FMD, the body switches to a ketogenic mode, burning visceral fat as a major energy source, and the brain shifts from burning sugar to burning ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">00:40:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">00:40:27</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">00:40:30</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">00:40:34</a>.
*   **IGF-1 and Growth Hormone Pathway**: Proteins and amino acids activate the growth hormone/IGF-1 axis and tyrosine kinase pathways, both recognized as powerful pro-aging pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">01:04:22</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">01:04:27</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">01:04:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">01:04:39</a>. Fasting lowers IGF-1, while refeeding increases it, driving regeneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">01:10:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">01:10:09</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">01:10:15</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">01:10:19</a>. People with mutations in the growth hormone receptor, such as the Ecuadoreans studied, show extended lifespan and significantly reduced incidence of cancer and diabetes, despite unhealthy lifestyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">01:04:04</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">01:05:15</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">01:05:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">01:05:30</a>. Similar effects are seen in mice with growth hormone receptor knockouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">01:04:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">01:04:55</a>.

## Fasting and Health Outcomes

### [[Impact of fasting on immune system and aging | Immune System and Aging]]
Fasting holds implications for human aging by addressing immunosenescence, the age-related decline in immune function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">00:07:19</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">00:07:25</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">00:07:31</a>.
*   **Lymphocyte Regeneration**: Studies in older mice showed that fasting caused lymphocyte numbers to return to more youthful levels, and the ratio of myeloid cells to lymphocytes shifted towards a younger profile, indicating a "rejuvenation of the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">00:08:02</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">00:08:41</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">00:08:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">00:09:01</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">00:09:09</a>. This is relevant as immunosenescence increases susceptibility to infections and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">00:09:18</a>.
*   **Inflammation**: Fasting-mimicking diets have been shown to decrease inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6 in mice and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">01:13:08</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">01:13:13</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">01:13:18</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">01:13:21</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">01:13:28</a>. While inflammation is a consistent biomarker of healthy aging, Longo suggests that aging itself is the cause of inflammation, rather than inflammation being the primary driver of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">01:11:28</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">01:11:35</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">01:11:41</a>.

### [[Fasting and cancer therapy | Cancer Therapy]]
Longo's research has identified two key effects of fasting related to cancer treatment:
1.  **Differential Stress Resistance (DSR)**: Fasting protects normal cells from the damaging effects of chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">00:19:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">00:19:25</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">00:19:29</a>. Normal cells enter a "shielding mode" in response to starvation, making them resistant to toxins like chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">00:19:53</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">00:20:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">00:20:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">00:20:25</a>.
2.  **Differential Stress Sensitization (DSS)**: Fasting sensitizes cancer cells to be killed by chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">00:19:30</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">00:19:35</a>. Cancer cells, adapted to high-nutrient environments (Warburg effect – relying on glucose), become "desperate" and vulnerable when glucose, amino acids, and growth factors are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">00:21:10</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">00:21:16</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">00:21:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">00:21:25</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">00:22:22</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">00:22:28</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">00:28:35</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">00:28:39</a>. They may attempt to switch to oxidative phosphorylation, which produces reactive oxygen species they are not equipped to handle, leading to cell suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">00:29:43</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">00:29:57</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">00:30:02</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">00:30:16</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">00:30:18</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">00:30:23</a>.

This dual effect means that combining fasting or FMDs with chemotherapy can lead to cancer-free survival in mice, an outcome rarely achieved with either intervention alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">00:23:16</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">00:23:23</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">00:23:28</a>. It represents a coordinated, multi-level approach that could disarm cancer cells and make them more susceptible to the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">00:30:35</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">00:30:43</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">00:31:18</a>.

> "Fasting was something that was normal for human beings, kinda like sleep. And then, maybe it was utilized for protection. And then, eventually when we stopped doing it, we lost this feature, we lost this help that the fasting had always given us. And maybe, that also caused us to be now, you know, exposed to this very high incidence of diseases that we earlier did not have." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">00:32:04</a>

### Multiple Sclerosis
In studies on multiple sclerosis, [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | FMDs]] caused destruction of autoimmune white blood cells, activated [[Fasting and stem cell regeneration | stem cells]] to generate new, non-autoimmune cells, reduced inflammation around the spinal cord, and allowed progenitor cells to rebuild myelin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">00:42:25</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">00:42:32</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">00:42:37</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">00:42:40</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">00:42:43</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">00:42:52</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">00:43:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">00:43:13</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">00:43:20</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">00:43:24</a>. A single week of [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | FMD]] followed by a Mediterranean diet showed better outcomes than six months of a continuous ketogenic diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">00:45:05</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">00:45:14</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">00:45:19</a>.

### Weight Management and Body Composition
Fasting, particularly FMDs, can lead to a specific loss of visceral fat with minimal or temporary loss of lean body mass, as the muscle is rebuilt during refeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">01:13:11</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">01:13:18</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">01:13:22</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">01:13:30</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">01:13:35</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">01:13:38</a>. This makes it appealing for athletes interested in optimizing body composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">01:13:43</a>.

### [[Fasting and exercise adaptations | Exercise]]
Exercise is highly beneficial. It can cause muscle damage followed by repair, leading to muscle building. While perhaps not as potent as fasting in terms of a large-scale regenerative process, consistent exercise contributes to cumulative small regenerative effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">01:11:40</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">01:11:45</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">01:11:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">01:11:52</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">01:11:59</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">01:12:04</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">01:12:12</a>. Weight training is particularly important to prevent loss of lean body mass during dietary restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">01:12:41</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">01:12:49</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">01:12:55</a>.

## Practical Applications

To make powerful metabolic interventions like [[different fasting methods and their effects | fasting]] more accessible and compliant for the general population, Longo advocates for flexible approaches.

### Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD)
The [[Fastingmimicking diet and longevity | FMD]] typically involves a period of four days to one week or longer of a diet that is low in protein, low in sugar, and high in healthy fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">00:02:21</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">00:02:28</a>. This structured approach, often provided as a pre-packaged "medicine-like" box of foods, significantly improves patient compliance compared to full water-only fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">00:15:38</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">00:15:42</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">00:15:49</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">00:15:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">00:16:01</a>. FMDs are currently being tested in various clinical trials for conditions like cancer, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">00:16:19</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">00:16:24</a>.

### Meal Frequency and Timing
Longo emphasizes flexibility in [[Dietary practices and metabolic health | dietary practices]] to ensure long-term adherence. He suggests a "two-meal-a-day program" within a 12-hour (or less) time window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">00:33:12</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">00:33:18</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">00:33:23</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">00:33:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">00:33:39</a>. This approach can help control weight and visceral fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">00:33:53</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">00:33:56</a>. The goal is to provide clear, simple rules that people can follow consistently throughout their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">00:34:02</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">00:34:08</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">00:37:35</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">00:37:42</a>.

### Integration with Traditional Medicine
Longo believes that these metabolic interventions will become standard in medical practice within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">00:17:31</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">00:17:38</a>. He advocates for combining powerful alternative/integrative medicine with traditional medicine, as each alone may not be as effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">00:23:51</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">00:23:59</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">00:24:05</a>. However, he stresses caution, especially when treating healthy individuals, due to the unknown long-term side effects of pharmaceutical interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">00:59:06</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">00:59:55</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">01:00:03</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">01:00:14</a>.

> "People don't understand that, you know, that both of them are very important, and when you combine it, particularly the alternative integrative medicine that's got a deep scientific foundation, when you combine it, now you have a very powerful system, you know, in your hands." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">00:23:59</a>

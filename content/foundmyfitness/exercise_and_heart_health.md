[[Exercise and metabolic health | Exercise]] should be considered a fundamental part of personal hygiene, akin to brushing teeth or eating breakfast, rather than an optional add-on [00:00:00]. It is crucial for maintaining overall health [00:00:17].

## Impact of Sedentary Behavior
Research has shown that even short periods of inactivity can significantly impact the body's physical capabilities.
*   **Dallas Bed Rest Study** A very influential study, the Dallas Bed Rest Study, initially conducted in the mid-1960s, placed five young men on [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | bed rest]] for three weeks [00:02:07]. The study revealed that three weeks of [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | bed rest]] negatively impacted the body's ability to do physical work more than 30 years of [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | aging]] [00:00:22].
    *   **Physiological Changes** The heart loses about 1% of its muscle mass per week during [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | bed rest]], and muscles also atrophy [00:00:30], [00:00:34], [00:04:46]. Blood vessels tend to shrink and contract to meet reduced demands, leading to a "shrinking and atrophy of the circulation" [00:05:00], [00:05:07], [00:05:14].
    *   **Maximal Oxygen Uptake (VO2 Max)** A key physiological parameter measured was maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), which represents the body's maximum capacity to take in, transport, and utilize oxygen for physical work [00:03:40]. This is considered the exercise physiologist's marker of fitness [00:03:55].
    *   **Reversibility** After three weeks of [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | bed rest]], subjects underwent two months of training. Unfit individuals quickly returned to or exceeded their baseline fitness [00:05:52]. Fitter individuals took the full two months to recover, and some didn't fully return to their prior peak [00:06:00], [00:06:04]. Recovery requires a gradual build-up of training [00:06:36].
*   **COVID-19 Pandemic Implications** The principles observed in [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | bed rest]] studies were echoed during the COVID-19 pandemic [00:06:42].
    *   Athletes who underwent brief quarantine and then quickly returned to monitored training showed a very low incidence of long COVID symptoms (0.06% out of 1,600 athletes in one study) [00:07:33], [00:07:37], [00:07:52]. This suggests that prompt return to physical activity after forced inactivity can be protective [00:08:20].
    *   This applies to people who didn't get severely ill; those with significant heart, lung, or brain injury from COVID-19 require different management [00:09:07].

## Cardiac [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | Aging]] and Sedentary Lifestyle
A major question is how much of normal [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | aging]] of the heart is due to becoming sedentary [00:13:36].
*   **Heart Mass and Compliance** The heart loses about 1% of its muscle mass per week in [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | bed rest]] [00:12:40], and can shrink by up to 25% in prolonged inactivity [00:13:06], [00:13:08]. The heart's "stretchiness" or compliance, which is its ability to accommodate blood, decreases with [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | aging]], similar to skin or a rubber band losing elasticity [00:14:54], [00:15:02], [00:15:07].
*   **Research on Sedentary vs. Active Seniors**
    *   A study compared healthy sedentary older adults to elite masters athletes (who trained almost daily for much of their lives) [00:14:10], [00:14:32].
    *   The hearts of elite masters athletes were "indistinguishable from healthy 30-year-olds" in terms of compliance [00:16:56], [00:16:57]. This suggests a lifetime of endurance training can prevent age-related cardiovascular stiffening [00:17:03], [00:17:08].
*   **Reversibility of Cardiac [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | Aging]]**
    *   A year of intense [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]] training in healthy, sedentary 70-year-olds improved fitness but did not change heart structure [00:21:12], [00:21:16], suggesting it might be "too late" to reverse structural [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | aging]] at that stage [00:21:41].
    *   However, a two-year study in "late middle-agers" (50-65 years old) showed that sustained, high-intensity training (4-5 days/week) was able to reverse the effects of sedentary [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | aging]] on heart compliance [00:21:52], [00:22:15], [00:22:22]. The heart's youthfulness was mostly restored [00:23:04], [00:23:07].

## Optimal [[impact_of_exercise_intensity_on_cardiovascular_health_and_longevity | Exercise]] Dose for Heart Health
For preserving youthful cardiovascular structure and function, research indicates a specific dose:
*   **Frequency**: Two to three days of [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]] per week over a lifetime had no protective effect against [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | aging]] [00:18:59]. Four to five days a week, however, achieved most of the benefit seen in competitive athletes [00:19:07], [00:19:11]. This "optimal dose" of physical activity, sustained over a lifetime, should be part of one's personal hygiene [00:19:21], [00:19:24], [00:45:12], [00:45:21].
*   **Timing of Intervention**: The heart starts to stiffen in early middle age (35-50) and then atrophy in late middle age (50-65) [00:20:09], [00:20:18], [00:20:31]. The "sweet spot" for effective intervention to reverse sedentary [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | aging]] is the late middle age period (50-65 years) [00:21:55].
*   **Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)**: AGEs contribute to tissue stiffening, including in blood vessels and the heart, and accumulate with [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | aging]] [00:23:27], [00:24:08], [00:24:10]. A study found that an AGE inhibitor alone did not help sedentary humans, but in combination with [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | training]], it resulted in a roughly 15-year reduction in apparent vascular age in 70-year-olds [00:24:40], [00:24:50], [00:25:05], [00:25:08], [00:25:15], [00:25:21]. This suggests [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]] (stretching blood vessels and heart) is enhanced by reducing AGEs [00:28:25], [00:28:33].

## Benefits of [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | Exercise]] Beyond Cardiac Structure
Even if one starts [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | training]] in their 70s and cannot reverse cardiac structure, many other significant benefits exist [00:29:37]:
*   **Endothelial Function**: [[Exercise and metabolic health | Exercise]] improves the function of the endothelium, the inner lining of arteries, allowing blood vessels to relax and expand as needed [00:29:46], [00:30:04], [00:30:11], [00:30:27]. Damage to the endothelium from factors like cholesterol, hypertension, and smoking contributes to atherosclerotic disease [00:30:14], [00:30:22].
*   **Autonomic Control**: [[Exercise and metabolic health | Exercise]] favorably alters the autonomic nervous system's control of circulation, increasing parasympathetic (rest and digest) tone and optimizing sympathetic (fight or flight) response [00:30:40], [00:30:58], [00:31:00], [00:31:13], [00:31:20]. This can be protective against sudden cardiac death [00:32:07], [00:32:27].
*   **Preservation of Aerobic Power (VO2 Max)**: [[Exercise and metabolic health | Exercise]] helps preserve aerobic power, which is crucial for maintaining functional capacity and delaying the point at which daily activities become maximal efforts [00:33:03], [00:33:06], [00:33:11], [00:33:17], [00:34:12]. Maintaining a high VO2 max extends "health span" [01:19:19], [01:21:18].
*   **Other Benefits**:
    *   May be protective against certain cancers (e.g., breast and colon cancer) [02:24:00], [02:24:27], [02:52:21].
    *   Helps prevent and manage [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | diabetes]] [02:52:50], [02:52:53].
    *   Increases blood flow to the brain and has a modest effect on preventing dementia [02:52:58], [02:53:01].
    *   Preserves mitochondrial function, the energy-producing organelles in various organs [02:51:14], [02:51:22], [02:51:24], [02:51:27], [02:51:30], [02:51:33].

## [[impact_of_exercise_intensity_on_cardiovascular_health_and_longevity | Exercise]] Prescription for Life
An ideal [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]] strategy incorporates various types of training and emphasizes consistency [00:40:11], [00:40:13], [00:40:15], [00:40:19].
*   **Components**:
    *   **One long session (at least an hour)**: Should be enjoyable (e.g., walking, cycling, dancing) [00:41:31], [00:41:35], [00:41:37].
    *   **One high-intensity session (e.g., 4x4)**: Four minutes at 95% max effort followed by three minutes of recovery, repeated four times [00:38:07], [00:38:14], [00:41:53], [00:41:56]. The intensity should be "as hard as you can go" for the duration, needing to be ready to stop at the end, but also ready to go again after recovery [00:38:22], [00:38:24], [00:38:26], [00:38:31].
    *   **Two to three moderate intensity sessions (at least 30 minutes)**: At an intensity where you can talk but not sing [00:41:00], [00:40:01], [00:42:19], [00:42:22].
    *   **One to two days of strength training**: This can include lifting weights, Pilates, or strength yoga [00:42:27], [00:42:29], [00:42:30], [00:42:34], [00:42:36].
*   **Training for Health vs. Performance**: The goal of [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]] should be clearly identified [00:43:03], [00:43:10]. Training for health and longevity (e.g., maintaining fitness and function) differs from training for competitive performance (e.g., competing in an Iron Man) [00:42:57], [00:43:13], [00:43:16], [00:43:18], [00:43:20], [00:43:25]. No athlete does "just one thing"; variety is key for adaptation and compliance [00:39:26], [00:40:11], [00:41:16], [00:41:19], [01:21:39].

## Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Longevity
Higher cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 max) correlates with lower mortality risk [00:44:53], [00:44:57].
*   **VO2 Max Components**: VO2 max is a function of cardiac output (how much blood the heart pumps) and the arterial-venous oxygen difference (how much oxygen is extracted by muscles) [00:47:17], [00:47:20], [00:47:37]. Cardiac output, in turn, depends on heart rate and stroke volume (blood pumped per beat) [00:47:51], [00:47:53].
*   **Stroke Volume Importance**: The biggest physiological difference between a sedentary person and an elite athlete is the athlete's larger stroke volume due to a heart that is "nice and stretchable and compliant" [00:48:52], [00:48:54], [00:48:57], [00:49:00], [00:49:02], [00:49:05], [00:49:07]. This directly links [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]]-induced cardiac adaptations (larger, more compliant heart) to improved fitness and health [00:49:20], [00:49:24], [00:49:26], [00:49:28], [00:49:30], [00:49:33].
*   **"Non-Responders"**: The concept of "non-responders" to [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]] is often misleading. Most people who don't show fitness improvements from standard guidelines may just need an increased or varied training dose [01:02:08], [01:02:12], [01:02:22], [01:02:24], [01:02:27], [01:03:06]. A study showed zero non-responders when the training dose was appropriately adjusted [01:03:29], [01:03:32].

## [[impact_of_exercise_intensity_on_cardiovascular_health_and_longevity | Training Intensity]] and Heart Rate Zones
Higher intensity [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]] generally leads to greater benefits in improving maximal aerobic power, but also carries higher acute risks (though still relatively small for fit individuals) [00:36:08], [00:36:10], [00:36:13], [00:36:16], [00:36:27], [00:36:30], [00:37:09], [00:37:12], [00:37:15].
*   **Heart Rate Zones (Example)**: A common five-zone model for [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | training]] intensity based on heart rate, often referencing ventilatory thresholds and lactate levels:
    *   **Zone 1 (Recovery)**: Below Zone 2, for easy efforts (e.g., <130 BPM) [01:46:14], [01:46:18].
    *   **Zone 2 (Moderate)**: About 20 BPM below Zone 3 (e.g., 130-150 BPM). Exercise where you can talk but are slightly short of breath [00:39:50], [00:39:53], [01:46:05], [01:46:10].
    *   **Zone 3 (Threshold/Maximal Steady State)**: The highest level sustainable for a prolonged period (e.g., 150-160 BPM) [01:45:27], [01:45:30], [01:45:31], [01:45:34], [01:45:38], [01:45:41], [01:45:44], [01:45:46].
    *   **Zone 4 (Critical Power)**: Highest intensity sustainable without failure or drift towards VO2 Max (e.g., 160-170 BPM) [01:46:40], [01:46:43], [01:46:46].
    *   **Zone 5 (Maximal)**: At VO2 Max (e.g., 170-180 BPM) [01:48:06], [01:48:09], [01:48:11], [01:48:12].

## Strength vs. Endurance Training Adaptations
*   **Traditional View (Morgan Roth Hypothesis)**:
    *   **Strength Training**: Characterized by high afterload (pressure on the heart due to constricted blood vessels during intense muscle contraction, which can raise systolic blood pressure to 400 mmHg or higher) [01:13:04], [01:13:07], [01:13:16], [01:13:21], [01:13:40], [01:13:42], [01:13:45], [01:13:55]. The heart adapts by thickening its walls (concentric hypertrophy) to reduce wall stress [01:14:38], [01:14:41], [01:14:44], [01:14:46], [01:14:55].
    *   **Endurance Training**: Characterized by massive increases in blood flow and venous return to the heart [01:15:23], [01:15:27]. The heart adapts by getting larger and more muscular, accommodating larger stroke volumes (eccentric hypertrophy), which is important for cardiorespiratory fitness [01:15:29], [01:15:30], [01:15:32], [01:15:35], [01:15:48], [01:15:59], [01:16:01], [01:16:03].
*   **Combined Training**: Many sports (e.g., rowing, skate skiing, CrossFit) involve a combination of both static (strength) and dynamic (endurance) components, leading to adaptations that incorporate both types of hypertrophy and very large hearts [01:16:26], [01:16:31], [01:16:33], [01:16:36], [01:16:39], [01:16:55], [01:16:57], [01:17:03], [01:17:06], [01:29:02], [01:29:08], [01:29:12], [01:29:14].
*   **Recommendation**: Strength-trained athletes should incorporate endurance training for long-term health, and athletes in sports requiring repetitive bursts of strength can enhance performance by including endurance work [01:20:10], [01:20:13], [01:20:15], [01:20:28], [01:20:30], [01:21:05], [01:21:08], [01:21:11].

## [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | Exercise]] and Blood Pressure
[[Exercise and metabolic health | Exercise]] is a key lifestyle modification for managing hypertension [01:31:35], [01:31:39].
*   **Mechanisms**: Dynamic [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]] (like running) causes local relaxation of blood vessels in working muscles while constricting vessels elsewhere, optimizing blood flow to active tissues [01:31:42], [01:31:46], [01:31:50], [01:32:08], [01:32:11], [01:32:15], [01:32:20], [01:32:23], [01:33:14], [01:33:16], [01:33:21], [01:33:24]. This sustained vasodilation helps reduce overall vascular resistance, a major component of blood pressure [01:33:57], [01:34:00], [01:34:02], [01:34:04], [01:34:06], [01:34:10], [01:34:21], [01:34:25].
*   **Isometric Exercise**: Recent studies on isometric [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]] (static holds) and blood pressure are contradictory to established data, and it is not recommended to switch primary blood pressure management to these types of exercises based on current evidence [01:34:50], [01:34:54], [01:34:57], [01:35:00], [01:35:02], [01:35:07], [01:35:09].
*   **Comprehensive Approach**: For hypertension, lifestyle changes (reducing salt and alcohol, ensuring adequate sleep, addressing sleep apnea) are foundational, but medication is often necessary for significant and sustained reduction [01:31:28], [01:31:31], [01:31:33], [01:31:35], [01:35:13], [01:35:16], [01:35:18], [01:35:19], [01:36:18], [01:36:20], [01:36:22], [01:36:25], [01:36:28], [01:36:31], [01:36:33], [01:36:36], [01:36:38], [01:36:41], [01:36:43], [01:36:45], [01:36:49], [01:36:52], [01:36:54], [01:36:56], [01:37:00]. Mild or early-stage hypertension, especially in younger individuals, may be reversible with lifestyle changes [01:37:10], [01:37:13], [01:37:15], [01:37:18], [01:38:13], [01:38:16], [01:38:19], [01:38:22], [01:38:24], [01:38:27], [01:38:30], [01:38:32].

## Recovery and Overtraining
Recovery is an essential part of [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | training]] [01:38:51], [01:38:55].
*   **Overtraining Syndrome**: Athletes often fall into a vicious cycle of overtraining if they try to compensate for poor performance by simply [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | training]] harder [01:39:01], [01:39:04], [01:39:10], [01:39:12], [01:39:14], [01:39:17], [01:39:19].
*   **Importance of Easy Sessions**: To reap the benefits of [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | training]] stimuli, the body needs to be allowed to recover and adapt [01:40:39], [01:40:43], [01:40:47], [01:40:53], [01:40:59], [01:41:02], [01:41:05], [01:41:08], [01:41:10], [01:41:14], [01:41:17], [01:41:18], [01:41:21], [01:41:23], [01:41:25], [01:41:30], [01:41:33]. Good coaches always incorporate easy sessions after high-intensity ones, and athletes should have a day off or engage in low-stress activities [01:41:40], [01:41:43], [01:41:48], [01:41:51], [01:41:53], [01:41:55], [01:41:58], [01:42:01], [01:42:03], [01:42:05], [01:42:08], [01:42:10], [01:42:13].
*   **Monitoring Recovery**: Early morning resting heart rate is a good indicator of recovery and can signal overtraining if it climbs [01:42:42], [01:42:44], [01:42:48], [01:42:51], [01:42:53], [01:42:55], [01:42:57], [01:43:03], [01:43:04], [01:43:06], [01:43:10], [01:43:12], [01:43:15], [01:43:17], [01:43:19], [01:43:21], [01:43:24], [01:43:26], [01:43:28], [01:43:30].
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**: While often discussed, direct measurement of HRV from consumer devices is generally unreliable as a training indicator because it is highly sensitive to breathing rate and other uncontrolled factors [01:50:11], [01:50:14], [01:50:16], [01:50:19], [01:50:20], [01:50:24], [01:50:28], [01:50:31], [01:50:35], [01:50:38], [01:50:41], [01:50:44], [01:50:47], [01:50:49], [01:50:52], [01:50:54], [01:50:57], [01:50:59], [01:51:01], [01:51:03], [01:51:05], [01:51:08], [01:51:10], [01:51:11], [01:51:13], [01:51:16], [01:51:18], [01:52:15], [01:52:17], [01:52:19], [01:52:23], [01:52:26], [01:52:28], [01:52:30], [01:52:32], [01:52:34], [01:52:37], [01:52:40], [01:52:41], [01:52:44], [01:52:46], [01:52:47], [01:52:50], [01:52:53], [01:52:55], [01:52:58], [01:53:01], [01:53:03], [01:53:06], [01:53:09], [01:53:12], [01:53:14], [01:53:17], [01:53:20], [01:53:21], [01:53:24], [01:53:26], [01:53:28], [01:53:30], [01:53:33], [01:53:37], [01:53:40], [01:53:45], [01:53:48], [01:53:50], [01:53:54], [01:53:57], [01:53:59], [01:54:01], [01:54:04], [01:54:07], [01:54:10], [01:54:13], [01:54:16], [01:54:18], [01:54:22], [01:54:25], [01:54:28], [01:54:31], [01:54:33], [01:54:35], [01:54:38].

## Sex Differences in Cardiovascular Performance
Fundamental biological differences exist between men and women, primarily due to the androgenic effects of testosterone, which influences muscle mass, fat, blood volume, heart size, and skeletal muscle power output [01:55:20], [01:55:21], [01:55:45], [01:55:47], [01:55:49], [01:55:52], [01:55:54], [01:55:57], [01:56:00], [01:56:02], [01:56:04], [01:56:08]. These differences become most pronounced after puberty [01:58:08], [01:58:10], [01:58:12], [01:58:14], [01:58:17], [01:58:21]. While women have extraordinary protection against cardiovascular disease due to estrogen and progesterone before menopause, this protection diminishes afterward [01:59:13], [01:59:16], [01:59:18], [01:59:21], [01:59:24], [01:59:51], [01:59:53], [01:59:55], [01:59:59], [02:00:01], [02:00:03], [02:00:06], [02:00:09], [02:00:12], [02:00:14]. Women should not assume they need less [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]] than men to achieve cardiovascular benefits; adaptation to [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | exercise]] is largely similar across sexes [01:59:42], [01:59:47], [01:59:49], [02:01:01], [02:01:03], [02:01:05], [02:01:32], [02:01:35], [02:01:38], [02:01:41]. However, women may see their heart size plateau earlier during [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | training]] compared to men, likely due to testosterone effects [02:01:44], [02:01:47], [02:01:49], [02:01:51], [02:01:53], [02:01:55].

## [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | Extreme Exercise]] and Cardiovascular Health
[[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | Extreme exercise]] can be defined as more than 10 hours a week of activity [02:03:00], [02:03:02], [02:03:06], [02:03:09], [02:03:10], [02:03:13], [02:03:16], [02:03:19], [02:03:21], [02:03:24], [02:03:26], [02:03:30], [02:03:34], [02:03:40], [02:03:43], [02:03:46], [02:03:48], [02:03:51], [02:03:53].
*   **Coronary Plaque Calcium**: Calcium is a "footprint of atherosclerosis," indicating the presence of hardening of the arteries [02:05:25], [02:05:27], [02:05:28], [02:05:30].
    *   **"Soft" vs. "Calcified" Plaque**: Calcified plaques are less likely to rupture and cause heart attacks; the concern is primarily with non-calcified or "soft" plaque [02:06:02], [02:06:04], [02:06:06], [02:06:09], [02:06:11], [02:06:14], [02:06:17], [02:06:18], [02:06:21], [02:06:23], [02:06:26].
    *   **[[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | Exercise]] and Plaque**: Studies have shown that higher volume [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | exercise]] in male athletes can be associated with more total plaque and more calcified plaque [02:06:55], [02:06:59], [02:07:02], [02:07:04]. However, these plaques tend to be calcified, suggesting [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | exercise]] might stabilize plaque and make it more rupture-resistant, contributing to lower mortality risk despite the presence of plaque [02:07:07], [02:07:09], [02:07:11], [02:07:13], [02:11:52], [02:11:54], [02:11:57].
    *   **Intensity vs. Duration**: Recent findings suggest that higher intensity [[impact_of_exercise_intensity_on_cardiovascular_health_and_longevity | exercise]] is likely more protective against calcium accumulation, while very long duration [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | exercise]] may be more calcium-inducing [02:12:24], [02:12:27], [02:12:29], [02:12:33], [02:12:37], [02:12:41], [02:12:46], [02:12:48], [02:12:51], [02:12:54].
*   **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)**: While increasing physical activity generally reduces the risk of AFib, there is a point (typically beyond 5-10 hours/week) where [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | extreme endurance exercise]] can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation [02:14:12], [02:14:16], [02:14:17], [02:14:20], [02:14:22], [02:14:23], [02:14:26], [02:14:28], [02:14:31], [02:14:35], [02:14:37], [02:14:38]. This is partly due to the heart's atria dilating under high cardiac output and rapid heart rate during prolonged [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | exercise]], which can create a "damming effect" at the valves [02:14:41], [02:14:44], [02:14:47], [02:14:50], [02:14:53], [02:14:56], [02:14:58], [02:15:00], [02:15:02], [02:15:05], [02:15:06], [02:15:08], [02:15:10], [02:15:15], [02:15:17], [02:15:21], [02:15:23], [02:15:25], [02:15:27], [02:15:29], [02:15:32], [02:15:34], [02:15:38], [02:15:41], [02:15:43], [02:15:45], [02:15:47], [02:15:49], [02:15:51], [02:15:53], [02:15:56], [02:15:58], [02:16:01], [02:16:02], [02:16:04], [02:16:07], [02:16:12], [02:16:14], [02:16:19], [02:16:21], [02:16:24], [02:16:26]. While AFib increases stroke risk in the general population, it's not clear if this risk is the same for athletes, who often have fewer other risk factors [02:17:56], [02:17:58], [02:18:00], [02:18:03], [02:18:04], [02:18:06], [02:18:08], [02:18:11], [02:18:15], [02:18:18], [02:18:21], [02:18:22].
*   **Life Expectancy**: There is no strong evidence that [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | extreme exercise]] prolongs life [02:22:01], [02:22:04], [02:22:05], [02:22:09], [02:22:11], [02:22:13], [02:22:15], and it is not recommended for the purpose of living longer [02:22:01]. While studies on very high [[effects_of_extreme_exercise_on_cardiovascular_health | exercise]] volumes have shown no increase in mortality [02:23:01], [02:23:03], [02:23:05], [02:23:07], [02:23:08], [02:23:10], [02:23:13], [02:23:16], [02:23:18], [02:23:20], [02:23:21], [02:23:23], [02:23:25], [02:23:27], [02:23:32], [02:23:34], [02:23:37], at older ages, factors like joints and muscles often become the limiting factors for extreme activity, not just the cardiovascular system [02:21:26], [02:21:30], [02:21:33], [02:21:35], [02:21:37], [02:21:41], [02:21:45]. The focus should shift to [[exercise_and_metabolic_health | healthspan]] over lifespan in extreme old age [02:23:48], [02:23:51], [02:23:53].

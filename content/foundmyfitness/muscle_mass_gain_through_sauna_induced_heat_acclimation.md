Heat acclimation, a process also referred to as hypothermic conditioning, can induce physiological adaptations that aid in the acquisition of muscle mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14">[01:14]</a>. [[sauna_as_a_complement_to_exercise | Sauna use]] is a primary method for achieving heat acclimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01">[01:01]</a>.

## How Heat Acclimation Promotes Muscle Hypertrophy

Muscle hypertrophy, the increase in muscle cell size, primarily depends on increasing protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05">[04:05]</a>. While exercise is a known inducer of muscle hypertrophy by increasing net protein synthesis, it also increases oxidative stress, which leads to protein degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10">[04:10]</a>. Therefore, anything that can combat oxidative stress during exercise will result in a net increase in protein synthesis and thus muscle hypertrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27">[04:27]</a>.

Heat acclimation promotes muscle hypertrophy through three main mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">[04:37]</a>:
1.  Induction of heat shock proteins (HSPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43">[04:43]</a>
2.  Boosting growth hormone levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45">[04:45]</a>
3.  Improving insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48">[04:48]</a>

### Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

Heat shock proteins are induced by heat exposure, serving as a prime example of hormesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50">[04:50]</a>. HSPs repair damaged proteins, prevent protein oxidation by scavenging free radicals, and increase endogenous antioxidants like glutathione, thereby contributing to a net increase in protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01">[05:01]</a>.

Acclimating the body to heat can lead to a higher baseline expression of HSPs and a more robust induction during subsequent elevations in core body temperature, such as during physical exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20">[05:20]</a>. In a study involving rats, hypothermic conditioning resulted in a significant induction of HSPs, correlating with 30% more muscle regrowth compared to controls after 7 days of immobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>.

### Growth Hormone (GH)

The anabolic effects of growth hormone are well-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56">[05:56]</a>. For instance, growth hormone administration to endurance athletes for 4 weeks led to 50% less protein oxidation and degradation, promoting muscle hypertrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00">[06:00]</a>.

[[effects_of_sauna_use_on_growth_hormone_and_prolactin | Sauna use]] can significantly impact growth hormone levels, with effects depending on temperature, time spent, and frequency of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11">[06:11]</a>.
*   Two 20-minute sauna sessions a day at 80°C can double growth hormone levels over baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18">[06:18]</a>.
*   The frequency of [[sauna_use_and_its_effects_on_growth_hormone_and_insulin_sensitivity | sauna use]] can have profound effects on growth hormone levels, highlighting the physiological adaptations that occur from hypothermic conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27">[06:27]</a>.
*   Two 1-hour daily sauna sessions at 80°C for 7 consecutive days resulted in a 16-fold increase in growth hormone levels over baseline in men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41">[06:41]</a>.

### Insulin Sensitivity

Heat acclimation can also promote muscle growth by improving insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10">[07:10]</a>. Insulin is anabolic because it reduces protein degradation, similar to heat shock proteins and growth hormone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14">[07:14]</a>. Whole-body hypothermia has been shown to reduce insulin resistance and improve [[sauna_use_and_its_effects_on_growth_hormone_and_insulin_sensitivity | insulin sensitivity]] in an obese diabetic mouse model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23">[07:23]</a>.

## Summary of Muscle Gain Benefits

Heat acclimation through [[sauna_as_a_complement_to_exercise | sauna use]] improves muscle hypertrophy by preventing protein degradation and increasing net protein synthesis through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46">[11:46]</a>:
*   Inducing the expression of heat shock proteins, which also arise from a hormetic response associated with improved [[effects_of_sauna_bathing_on_longevity | longevity]] in lower organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55">[11:55]</a>.
*   Increasing the release of growth hormone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03">[12:03]</a>.
*   Improving insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08">[12:08]</a>.

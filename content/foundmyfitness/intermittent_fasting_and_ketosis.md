Dr. Dom D'Agostino, an associate professor at the University of South Florida and research scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, specializes in metabolic therapies including [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diets]] and [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | ketone supplements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. He notes that the term "keto" has exploded in popularity, becoming more of a brand and less recognized as a distinct metabolic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Understanding Ketosis and the Ketogenic Diet

A [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] is defined by an objective biomarker: elevated ketones in the blood, urine, or breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. If ketones are not elevated (hyperketonemia), one is technically not on a [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. To achieve therapeutically significant levels of ketones, it's necessary to increase fat intake, significantly drop carbohydrates, and moderate protein consumption, which results in a very high-fat diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Types of Ketogenic Diets

There are variations of the [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>:
*   **Classical Ketogenic Diet (4:1 or 5:1 ratio)**: This is typically 80-90% fat with one part protein and carbohydrates combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. It is used clinically for pediatric epilepsy, sometimes in extreme 5:1 cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. For example, a 4:1 ratio could mean 400 grams of fat to 90 grams of protein and 10 grams of carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Modified Ketogenic Diet / Modified Atkins / Low Glycemic Index Therapy (1:1 to 1.5:1 ratio)**: This is a more liberal version, where the ratio of fat to combined protein and carbohydrates is around 1:1 or 1.5:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This approach can produce a mild state of [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] and may be suitable as a lifestyle diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. An example of a 1:1 diet might be 200 grams of fat, 150 grams of protein, and 50 grams of carbohydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

Both classical and modified [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diets]] have anti-seizure effects, and benefits can be seen even with low ketone levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Dr. Eric Kossoff from Johns Hopkins developed a modified Atkins diet for adult epilepsy around 2007-2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## The Relationship Between Fasting and Ketosis

A [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] generates [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] primarily by suppressing insulin, similar to how [[intermittent_fasting | fasting]] works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. When a person [[intermittent_fasting | fasts]], insulin is suppressed, liver glycogen is depleted, and the beta-oxidation of fatty acids is accelerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This over-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver leads to the production of acetyl-CoA, which then condenses into acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. A classical [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] (80-90% fat with minimal carbohydrates) can mimic this state of [[intermittent_fasting | fasting]] by keeping insulin and IGF-1 low, and moderating protein to suppress mTOR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

For individuals starting a [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] for lifestyle rather than clinical reasons, easing into it by titrating carbohydrates down over four to six weeks is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This gradual approach improves compliance and reduces side effects like sleep disruption, lipid abnormalities, and elevated triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. [[caloric_restriction_intermittent_fasting_and_their_biological_effects | Calorie restriction]] can also mitigate negative aspects associated with high-fat diets, making the transition easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

### Measuring Ketosis

Ketones can be measured in blood, urine, and breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Urine strips** are a good initial semi-quantitative tool to confirm if someone is in [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:50">[02:31:50]</a>.
*   **Blood ketone meters** (like Keto-Mojo) provide precise measurements of beta-hydroxybutyrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:59">[02:31:59]</a>.
*   **Breath acetone meters** (like Readout Health Biosense) are good for tracking [[fasting_and_metabolic_health | fat oxidation]] and are more stable, indicating fat loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:48">[02:29:48]</a>. Acetone levels also correlate with seizure control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:25">[02:31:25]</a>.
*   **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)** can act as a proxy for adherence to a [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]], as the glucose trace should be relatively flat with minimal excursions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:46">[02:32:46]</a>.

The **Glucose Ketone Index (GKI)**, calculated as glucose over ketones in millimolar concentration, is also a useful metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:42">[02:28:42]</a>. Achieving a GKI of one by [[intermittent_fasting | fasting]] for 72 hours (e.g., glucose at 3 mmol/L and ketones at 3 mmol/L) is believed to induce and maximize autophagy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:59">[02:28:59]</a>.

## Exogenous Ketones

[[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | Exogenous ketones]] are supplements that elevate bioidentical ketone bodies in the blood and tissues, offering a way to achieve [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] without strict dietary adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. They contain calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

### Types of Exogenous Ketones
*   **Ketone Esters**: These formulations can lead to a very rapid and significant spike in beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. A rapid spike can cause a counter-regulatory release of insulin, which may shut down natural ketone production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. Very high doses (e.g., 30-50 ml of pure ketone ester) can drop glucose into hypoglycemic ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.
*   **Ketone Salts**: These are beta-hydroxybutyrate bound to electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. Electrolytes and MCTs can delay gastric absorption, leading to a slower, sustained elevation of ketones, which is preferred to avoid insulin spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
*   **MCT Oils/Powders**: Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a type of fat that can be metabolized into ketones in the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. MCTs can boost and extend the sustainment of [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] when combined with ketone esters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.

Dr. D'Agostino suggests that keeping [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | exogenous ketones]] within an elevation of 1 to 3 millimolar is optimal for most purposes, as levels above 3 millimolar can lead to metabolic acidosis and a pH drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>.

## Benefits and Applications of Ketosis

### Neurological Disorders
The [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] remains the only widely accepted application for epilepsy and metabolic disorders like glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. [[ketosis_and_its_effects | Ketosis]] works through multiple synergistic mechanisms for anti-seizure effects, including elevating adenosine, activating ketone receptors, anti-inflammatory pathways, and increasing GABAergic tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | Exogenous ketones]] have shown remarkable anti-seizure, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective effects in animal models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. Dr. D'Agostino personally witnessed [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | exogenous ketones]] acutely stop tremors in a patient with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's-like symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:20">[01:50:20]</a>.

### Metabolic Health
The [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] can optimize metabolic parameters and glycemic variability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>. [[ketosis_and_its_effects | Ketosis]] helps manage type 2 diabetes and weight loss, partly because ketones have a satiating effect on the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:18">[01:47:18]</a>. The brain can metabolize ketones, preventing an energetic crisis even with low glucose, which helps with adherence to [[caloric_restriction_intermittent_fasting_and_their_biological_effects | calorie restriction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:29">[01:47:29]</a>.

### Exercise Performance and Anti-Catabolic Effects
While [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketones]] may have a small effect on general aerobic performance, they excel in preserving performance resilience in extreme environments, such as hyperoxia or hypoxia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>. The combination of [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | ketones]] and caffeine is a powerful ergogenic aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:29">[01:19:29]</a>. Chronically, [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | exogenous ketones]] may facilitate adaptive responses to exercise by suppressing chronic inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>.

[[ketosis_and_its_effects | Ketones]] help prevent muscle loss during [[intermittent_fasting | fasting]] periods or [[caloric_restriction_intermittent_fasting_and_their_biological_effects | limited food availability]] by providing alternative energy to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:38]</a>. They reduce the liberation of gluconeogenic amino acids like alanine from skeletal muscle, thus having anti-catabolic effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. [[ketosis_and_its_effects | Ketones]] also work through anti-inflammatory pathways, mitigating inflammation-induced muscle wasting seen in conditions like cachexia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.

### Cancer Prevention and Treatment
Research suggests that a [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] (especially if calorie-restricted) can put metabolic stress on cancer cells, stimulate cancer cell death, and make tumors more sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:08">[02:04:08]</a>. It also protects normal cells and augments the immune system's ability to attack cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:26">[02:04:26]</a>. Some studies show that [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diets]] can suppress spontaneous tumors in rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:56">[02:16:56]</a>. The therapeutic efficacy for cancer is primarily through insulin suppression and limiting glucose availability, rather than ketones directly treating cancer cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:06">[02:12:06]</a>.

### Other Potential Benefits
*   **Reduced Anxiety**: Individuals have reported lower anxiety levels while in [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] from [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diets]] or [[intermittent_fasting | fasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.
*   **Migraine Management**: Both the [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] and [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | ketone supplements]] have been anecdotally reported to manage chronic migraines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:52">[01:56:52]</a>. This may involve increased GABAergic tone, altered brain blood flow, and anti-inflammatory effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:10">[01:57:10]</a>.
*   **Autoimmune Disease**: Preliminary evidence suggests [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diets]] and [[intermittent_fasting | fasting]] may help with autoimmune conditions, possibly by modulating the immune system and reducing intestinal permeability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:57">[02:00:57]</a>.

## Considerations and Personal Experiences

### Diet and Lifestyle Adherence
*   **Calorie Counting**: Even on a [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]], tracking calories and macronutrients, at least initially, is important because the caloric density of a [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] can be 50% higher than standard diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Fiber and Phytonutrients**: Incorporating fibrous vegetables and healthy fats (monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, MCTs) is crucial for digestion, protein assimilation, and preserving the gut microbiome on a [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:20">[01:44:20]</a>. Cooked greens can have a higher glycemic impact than raw greens due to ruptured cell walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>.
*   **Protein Intake**: Large amounts of protein, like whey protein, can cause an insulin response and kick a person out of [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>.
*   **Order of Eating**: Eating foods in a certain order or combination can impact glycemic response and continually suppress insulin signaling to maintain [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:45">[01:59:45]</a>.
*   **Chronic vs. Cyclical Ketosis**: Chronic [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] may not be ideal for most people unless managing a specific disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>. Dr. D'Agostino believes in relative changes and uses [[intermittent_fasting | intermittent fasting]] (2-3 times a week) and a modified [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] for optimal benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>. The concept of a fasting-mimicking diet for a few days a month (Dr. Valter Longo) also supports this cyclical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.
*   **Carnivore Diet**: While it is a form of [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] and can be beneficial for some, its long-term optimality is questionable due to lack of fiber and phytonutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:43">[02:18:43]</a>.

### Biomarkers to Monitor
When starting a [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]], it's important to titrate carbohydrates down and monitor blood work, including glucose levels, to check for hypoglycemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>. Lipids (triglycerides, LDL) should also be monitored as they can elevate, especially if not calorie-restricting initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>. Nutrient deficiencies, like selenium deficiency, have been linked to serious conditions (e.g., cardiomyopathy) in severe [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diets]], emphasizing the need for appropriate food choices or supplementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:09">[02:06:09]</a>.

### Genetic Considerations
For individuals with the APOE4 allele (about a quarter of the population), an extremely high-fat [[ketogenic_diet_and_its_metabolic_benefits | ketogenic diet]] is probably not ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:22">[02:25:22]</a>. A more moderate approach with carbohydrate restriction, lots of fiber, phytonutrients, and monounsaturated fats is suggested, potentially supplemented with [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | exogenous ketones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:38">[02:25:38]</a>.

### Supplements
Dr. D'Agostino takes [[exogenous_ketones_and_their_uses | ketone salts]] with electrolytes daily, along with creatine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and taurine, to help boost [[ketosis_and_its_effects | ketosis]] and address potential deficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>. He also emphasizes omega-3s (DHA, EPA) and magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>. Vitamin D supplementation is also mentioned, noting the importance of reliable brands and individual needs possibly influenced by genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.

It is important to be cautious with "keto-marketed" products, as many can contain hidden sugars or ingredients that cause blood glucose spikes, despite being labeled "keto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:29">[02:38:29]</a>.

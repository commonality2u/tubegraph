Cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, collard greens, bok choy, packed oi, watercress, land cress, radish, daikon, and wasabi, are known for their health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Research shows profound associations between cruciferous vegetable consumption and a reduced risk of cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. A 2011 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that people in the top 20% of vegetable consumption had a 16% reduction in all-cause mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This effect was even more substantial for the top 20% of cruciferous vegetable consumers, who experienced a 22% reduction in all-cause mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Cancer Prevention
Numerous studies highlight the role of cruciferous vegetables, and specifically [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]], in cancer prevention:
*   **Prostate Cancer** Men consuming three to five servings of cruciferous vegetables per week had a 40% decreased risk of prostate cancer compared to those eating less than one serving per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Bladder Cancer** Men who ate two or more half-cup servings of broccoli per week had a 44% lower incidence of bladder cancer than those who ate less than one serving each week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Lung Cancer** Smokers who consumed at least 4.5 servings of raw cruciferous vegetables per month showed a 55% reduction in lung cancer risk compared to those who consumed less than 2.5 servings per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Breast Cancer** Women who ate cruciferous vegetables at least once a week saw a 17% to 50% decrease in breast cancer risk, with the highest reduction for daily consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The variation in these studies may relate to preparation methods (fresh vs. frozen) which affect the bioavailability of active compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Role of Isothiocyanates, Especially Sulforaphane
The most likely candidates for these effects are isothiocyanates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. These compounds are formed from glucosinolates by an enzyme called myrosinase, which is activated when cruciferous plant tissue is crushed, chopped, or chewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Myrosinase is inactivated by prolonged heat, such as sustained boiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

[[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | Sulforaphane]] stands out among isothiocyanates due to its potency and extensive scientific scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. It is formed from a glucosinolate known as glucoraphanin (or sulforaphane glucosinolate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The best source of glucoraphanin and sulforaphane is likely [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprouts]], which can contain up to 100 times more glucoraphanin than mature broccoli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Sprouting is an inexpensive process that can be done at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Action for Cancer Prevention
[[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | Sulforaphane]] reduces cancer risk and kills cancer cells through multiple pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>:

### Phase One Biotransformation Enzymes
Sulforaphane deactivates a family of enzymes known as phase one biotransformation enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. These enzymes convert pro-carcinogens into active carcinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. By deactivating them, sulforaphane can prevent the formation of DNA adducts, a type of DNA damage that leads to cancer after exposure to certain carcinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This may explain why increased cruciferous vegetable consumption can lower lung cancer risk in smokers, as tobacco smoke is rich in carcinogens that form DNA adducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Phase Two Detoxification Enzymes (Nrf2 Pathway)
Sulforaphane also activates Phase two detoxification enzymes, which help excrete harmful compounds from the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This effect is mediated via the Nrf2 pathway, for which [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] is the most potent naturally occurring inducer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Nrf2 controls hundreds of genes, including those that activate phase two detoxification enzymes like glutathione S-transferase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. These enzymes deactivate pro-carcinogenic agents and transform them into water-soluble conjugates that can be excreted in urine and bile, also lowering DNA damage, inflammation, and reactive oxygen species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Consumption of Brussels sprouts (300 grams/day) increased circulating glutathione S-transferase by about 1.4-fold and decreased oxidative DNA damage by 28% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

#### Carcinogen Excretion
A notable study demonstrated that [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] and its precursor glucoraphanin significantly increase the excretion of benzene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Participants who drank a daily broccoli sprout beverage (containing ~262.5 mg glucoraphanin and ~7.1 mg sulforaphane, equivalent to ~135 grams of fresh [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprouts]]) increased their rate of benzene excretion by 61% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Benzene is a carcinogen found in automobile exhaust, air pollution, and cigarette smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

The broccoli sprout drink also increased the excretion of acrolein, another airborne carcinogen found in pollution and formed when carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. A beverage with 27 mg of sulforaphane led to a 50% increase in excretion of acrolein, croton aldehyde, ethylene oxide, and benzene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

Another study showed that an isothiocyanate found in watercress can detoxify NNK, a tobacco-specific lung carcinogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Smokers eating 57 grams of watercress with each meal for three days showed a 35% increase in excretion biomarkers indicating NNK inactivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

> "Consumption of cruciferous vegetables, including watercress, but perhaps especially [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprouts]] since they are so rich in sulforaphane, is a powerful way to detoxify and excrete harmful compounds that we are exposed to on a daily basis, but even more so if you're a smoker." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>

## Cancer Treatment and Progression
[[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | Sulforaphane]] also shows promise in slowing cancer progression:

*   **Bladder Cancer Mortality** People with bladder cancer who consumed just four servings of raw broccoli per month had a 57% reduction in bladder cancer mortality and a 43% reduction in all-cause mortality compared to those who had only one serving per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Prostate Cancer Biomarkers** Clinical trials have investigated the effects of [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] from [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprouts]] on prostate cancer treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Men given 60 milligrams of sulforaphane per day (from ~140 grams of fresh [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprouts]]) experienced an 86% slowing of the doubling rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a cancer biomarker, compared to placebo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. A lower dose of 35 milligrams of sulforaphane increased the average PSA doubling time by 57% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. These effects appear to be dose-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Breast Tissue Accumulation** In a 2007 pilot study, [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] was detected in human breast tissue after consuming broccoli sprout extract containing ~37 milligrams of sulforaphane (equivalent to ~85 grams of fresh [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprouts]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   Breast tissue also showed increased levels of NQO1, a gene that makes an enzyme with protective functions, including detoxification and protecting the tumor suppressor gene p53 from degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This occurred within one hour of consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Over 50% of adult cancers have a mutated or broken p53 gene, highlighting its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
    *   In mice, [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] has been shown to inhibit the growth of breast cancer stem cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Inflammation and Aging
[[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | Sulforaphane]]'s ability to lower inflammation is crucial, as chronic inflammation is a driver of aging and linked to cancer and other age-related diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
*   Cruciferous vegetable consumption (14 grams per kg body weight daily) decreased circulating levels of IL-6 (an inflammatory cytokine) by 20% in healthy individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
*   A [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprout]] powder (containing ~40 mg [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]], equivalent to ~100 grams of fresh sprouts) reduced TNF-alpha by 11% and C-reactive protein by 16% in people with type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   High consumers of cruciferous vegetables (top 20%) had a 25% reduction in circulating IL-6 and a 12.6% reduction in TNF alpha compared to low consumers (bottom 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

## Dosage and Bioavailability
Only about 20% of glucoraphanin is bioavailable and converted into [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. The myrosinase enzyme, which converts glucoraphanin to sulforaphane, is heat-sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>. Prolonged heating or boiling of cruciferous vegetables inactivates myrosinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.

While gut bacteria can produce myrosinase, their efficiency varies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>.
To maximize sulforaphane production:
*   Consuming [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprouts]] with [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprout]] powder can increase sulforaphane absorption almost two-fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. Mustard seed can also be an effective supplemental source of myrosinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.
*   Light steaming (3-4 minutes) or heating mature broccoli to 60°C (140°F) for 10 minutes, or [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprouts]] to 70°C (158°F) for 10 minutes, can increase sulforaphane production by deactivating epithiospecifier protein, which prevents its formation, while leaving myrosinase activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. Increasing the temperature too much inactivates myrosinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

For a target dose of 60 milligrams of [[sulforaphane_and_its_health_benefits | sulforaphane]] per day (shown to reduce prostate cancer biomarker doubling rate by 86%), approximately 140 grams (fresh weight) of [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprouts]] may be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. For 40 milligrams of sulforaphane (linked to reductions in triglycerides and oxidized LDL), about 100 grams of fresh [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprouts]] may be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.

### Goitrogenic Concerns
Some studies suggest that isothiocyanates can compete with iodine for transport into the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. However, most evidence indicates this is primarily a concern under conditions of severe iodine deficiency, which is uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>. Healthy individuals given a dose of isothiocyanates roughly equivalent to 70 grams of [[supplementation_and_natural_sources_of_sulforaphane | broccoli sprouts]] showed no negative effects on thyroid hormones or liver toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>. The evidence for the usefulness of isothiocyanates is considered too strong to dismiss them as anti-nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.

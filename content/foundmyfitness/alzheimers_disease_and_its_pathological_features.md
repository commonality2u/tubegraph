## Introduction
Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of cognitive decline, ultimately leading to dementia [00:01:14]. The understanding of this disease has been evolving for over 100 years since Alois Alzheimer's publications in 1906 and 1907 [00:02:15].

## Pathological Hallmarks
By definition, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau tangles in the brain [00:01:21]. These are considered the two main pathological hallmarks [00:01:31].

However, the presence of these markers does not fully explain the cause of the disease [00:01:36]. It is possible to observe conditions that look virtually identical to Alzheimer's without amyloid plaques, and conversely, amyloid plaques can be present without corresponding cognitive decline [00:01:40]. This suggests that amyloid is a marker, but an imperfect one [00:01:50].

## Evolving Understanding of Amyloid Beta
Amyloid has historically been "vilified" and is recognized as a neurotoxin with toxic effects [00:02:26]. However, the surprising discovery has been that amyloid also functions as a protectant [00:02:36].

Amyloid is produced by the brain in response to specific insults [00:02:41]:
*   **Antimicrobial Agent** Professor Rudy Tanzi and Professor Robert Moir showed that amyloid is an antimicrobial [00:02:47].
*   **Divalent Metal Binder** Professor Ashley Bush demonstrated that amyloid is a good binder of divalent metals like copper, zinc, and iron [00:02:55].
*   **Response to Trophic Support Reduction** Amyloid production is also a response to a reduction in trophic support, leading to a change in signaling [00:03:07].

Therefore, amyloid formation is a protective response to various insults and metabolic changes [00:03:16]. While its production increases the risk for a degenerative process, many individuals produce amyloid as a successful protective measure without experiencing the "downsizing" of the brain network [00:03:29]. [[new_paradigms_for_understanding_alzheimers_and_dementia | New paradigms for understanding Alzheimers and dementia]] suggest that when inflammation is present on top of amyloid production, outcomes tend to be worse [00:03:40].

## Types of Alzheimer's Disease
Dr. Dale Bredesen's research has identified 36 contributing factors to Alzheimer's, which largely break down into a few categories [00:03:52]:

### Type 1: Inflammatory or "Hot" Alzheimer's
This type is characterized by inflammation, often triggered by pathogens [00:04:00]. This inflammation can arise from:
*   A leaky gut [00:04:06]
*   Specific bacteria like *P. gingivalis* [00:04:08] or *Borrelia* (Lyme disease) [00:04:12]
*   Exposure to fungi [00:04:15]
The amyloid response in this type is likened to "napalm" â€“ it kills "bad guys" but simultaneously reduces the brain's "arable soil," leading to a downsizing of the neural network [00:04:22]. This type was recognized by Ayurvedic physicians thousands of years ago as dementia related to "hot" or inflammatory states [00:04:51].

### Type 2: Atrophic or "Cold" Alzheimer's
This type is associated with a decrease in trophic (growth and support) factors [00:05:04], which corresponds to what Ayurvedic physicians called "dryness" [00:05:07]. Essential trophic factors include:
*   Nerve growth factor (NGF) [00:05:12]
*   Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [00:05:14]
*   Hormones like estradiol, testosterone, pregnenolone, progesterone, and thyroid [00:05:15]
*   Vitamin D [00:05:19]
These factors are critical for synaptogenesis (the formation of synapses) [00:05:24]. In Alzheimer's, there is a shift in the ratio of synaptoblastic (making and storing synapses) to synaptoclastic (pulling back and reorganizing synapses) activity [00:05:30]. This leads to a downsizing of the neural network when it cannot be adequately supported [00:06:16].

### Type 1.5: Glycotoxic Alzheimer's
This subtype exhibits features of both inflammatory (Type 1) and atrophic (Type 2) Alzheimer's [00:06:36]. It arises from insulin resistance, leading to changes in cellular signaling due to chronically high insulin [00:06:50]. This affects the response to insulin, which normally acts as a supportive trophic factor [00:07:14]. Additionally, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) form due to elevated blood glucose (measured by hemoglobin A1C), triggering an inflammatory response [00:07:26]. This creates a combined inflammatory and atrophic state [00:07:37]. This type reflects the [[alzheimers_disease_and_insulin_resistance | connections between insulin resistance and Alzheimers disease]] and the [[effect_of_inflammation_and_insulin_resistance_on_alzheimers | effect of inflammation and insulin resistance on Alzheimers]].

### Type 3: Toxic or "Vile" Alzheimer's
This type is a response to various toxins [00:07:41]:
*   **Metalotoxins** (e.g., mercury) [00:07:46]
*   **Organic Toxins** (e.g., DDE, found in health and beauty aids) [00:07:48]
*   **Biotoxins** (e.g., mycotoxins like trycothesinson, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin, gliotoxin produced by molds such as *Stachybotrys*, *Aspergillus*, and *Penicillium*) [00:07:52]
Individuals with Type 3 often present at a younger age (late 40s to mid-50s), are frequently women, and are often [[the_genetic_role_of_apoe_e4_in_alzheimers_disease | ApoE4]] negative (unless homozygous for [[the_genetic_role_of_apoe_e4_in_alzheimers_disease | ApoE4]]) [00:12:34]. Their presentation is typically non-amnestic, involving executive dysfunction, calculation problems, visual perception issues, or word-finding difficulties (primary progressive aphasia) [00:08:52]. This presentation is often seen in younger individuals and [[the_genetic_role_of_apoe_e4_in_alzheimers_disease | ApoE4]]-negative individuals [00:09:14].

A prominent characteristic of Type 3 is often a low serum zinc level, a high copper-zinc ratio, and low triglycerides, although the reasons for these specific metabolic changes are not fully understood [00:09:33]. Zinc deficiency is common globally and can be influenced by factors like poor gastric acidity, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, and copper piping [00:10:20]. A high copper-zinc ratio has been linked to dementia for over 30 years [00:10:55].

### Type 4: Vascular Component & Type 5: Traumatic Component
These types are also recognized, though they are considered related to the primary types of inflammation, trophic support, and toxin exposure [00:07:52].

### Overlap of Types
While distinct types exist, most people exhibit a mixture of these categories. Rarely do individuals have a purely single type (e.g., purely Type 1.5, 1, or 2) [01:01:56]. Over 50% of evaluated cases show at least some indication of Type 3 (toxin exposure) [01:02:12].

## Role of Tau Tangles
Phosphorylated tau tangles are also a defining feature of Alzheimer's [00:01:21]. Tau phosphorylation allows tau to detach from microtubules, leading to a rapid collapse of cellular structure [01:00:09]. This process makes sense in a mode where the brain is attempting to "pull back" or reorganize its structure [01:00:16]. Similar to amyloid, tau is considered a mediator of the pathophysiology, not the ultimate cause [01:00:35]. Its phosphorylation is driven by genetic factors, pathogens, toxins, metabolic changes, and trauma [01:00:42].

## Biomarkers for Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Risk
For a "cognoscopy" (a comprehensive cognitive assessment), various [[biomarkers_for_cognitive_decline_and_alzheimers_risk | biomarkers for cognitive decline and Alzheimers risk]] are measured to understand individual risk factors and causes of cognitive decline [00:16:07]:
*   **Genetic Factors**: [[the_genetic_role_of_apoe_e4_in_alzheimers_disease | ApoE4]] status is critical [00:16:28].
*   **Inflammation**: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) [00:20:30].
*   **Methylation**: Homocysteine (optimal levels are less than 7, not 13) [00:20:37]. High homocysteine is linked to more rapid decline in cerebral grey matter and hippocampal volume [00:20:47].
*   **Glycotoxicity/Insulin Sensitivity**: Fasting insulin (optimally less than 5), hemoglobin A1C, and fasting glucose [00:21:54].
*   **Trophic Support**: Vitamin D (optimal levels), pregnenolone, progesterone, estradiol, testosterone, free T3, and inferring BDNF and NGF levels from lifestyle (e.g., exercise) [00:23:04].
*   **Toxin Exposure**: Testing for metalotoxins (e.g., mercury), organic toxins (e.g., DDE), and biotoxins (e.g., mycotoxins via urinary tests or home mold tests like ERMI) [00:25:36].

## Amyloid Clearance and its Impairment
The brain has multiple ways to clear amyloid, including:
*   Insulin-degrading enzyme [00:45:05]
*   Neprilysin [00:45:06]
*   Macrophage clearance [00:45:07]
*   The glymphatic system [00:45:08], which is actively involved in sweeping out waste during [[connections_between_sleep_and_alzheimers_disease | sleep]] [00:31:52].

However, in Alzheimer's patients, there's a phenomenon where immune cells (macrophages) are poor at phagocytosing (eating and getting rid of) amyloid [00:43:24]. This suggests that affected individuals are in a state where they are "literally trying to keep the amyloid around" [00:43:32]. This state is linked to either a pro-inflammatory (high M1, low M2 macrophages) or an atrophic (low overall macrophage activity) state, both of which hinder amyloid resolution [00:44:21]. Resolution of inflammation, often facilitated by omega-3 fatty acids and derived molecules like resolvins, is crucial for proper amyloid clearance [00:46:32].

Failed clinical trials targeting amyloid plaques have highlighted the challenge of simply removing amyloid without addressing the underlying causes [00:56:20]. While amyloid is a mediator of pathophysiology, it is also a protectant [00:56:56]. Removing amyloid is beneficial only after the root causes of its production are addressed [00:57:09].

Hydrolyzed collagen powder is an ingredient added to smoothies, not primarily for essential amino acids like leucine, which is not abundant in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37">[12:37]</a>. Instead, it is valued for its high content of non-essential amino acids, specifically glycine and proline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40">[12:40]</a>. These amino acids are crucial for the body's production of collagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46">[12:46]</a>.

## Composition and Role of Collagen
Collagen constitutes approximately 25% to 35% of the total protein in the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55">[12:55]</a>. It is highly abundant in various connective tissues, including:
*   Ligaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02">[13:02]</a>
*   Tendons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02">[13:02]</a>
*   Cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02">[13:02]</a>
*   Skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02">[13:02]</a>
*   Blood vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05">[13:05]</a>
*   Muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05">[13:05]</a>
*   The gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05">[13:05]</a>
*   Dentin in teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07">[13:07]</a>

Glycine makes up about 35% of collagen, while proline, along with hydroxyproline, accounts for approximately 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48">[12:48]</a>. The body continuously produces new collagen to repair connective tissue damaged by daily wear and tear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10">[13:10]</a>.

## Absorption and Distribution
Research, including a study using radio-labeled hydrolyzed collagen fed to mice, indicates that ingested hydrolyzed collagen is absorbed in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34">[13:34]</a>:
1.  **Degraded Amino Acids**: Some collagen is broken down into individual amino acids and absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48">[13:48]</a>.
2.  **Intact Peptides**: Some collagen is absorbed fully intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55">[13:55]</a>.
Notably, intact collagen has been shown to accumulate in cartilage over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57">[13:57]</a>.

## Roles of Specific Amino Acids in Hydrolyzed Collagen

### Proline
Proline, which is very abundant in hydrolyzed collagen, serves multiple functions:
*   **Energy Production**: It can be converted into glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate, which mitochondria then use to produce ATP (energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04">[14:04]</a>. This pathway is particularly active during catabolic conditions, such as when glucose levels are very low, leading to proline release from connective tissue for energy generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20">[14:20]</a>.
*   **Wound Healing**: Proline may have a significant role in wound healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34">[14:34]</a>. Levels of proline at a wound site can increase by 50% above plasma levels ten days after an injury, suggesting active transport to aid in the healing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36">[14:36]</a>.

### Glycine
Glycine, another abundant amino acid in hydrolyzed collagen powder, also possesses interesting properties:
*   **Anti-inflammatory Signaling**: Glycine has been identified as an anti-inflammatory signaling molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02">[15:02]</a>.
*   **Neurotransmitter**: It functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07">[15:07]</a>.

Further studies are anticipated to fully elucidate whether the glycine from hydrolyzed collagen powder contributes to these functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16">[15:16]</a>.

From: [[foundmyfitness]] <br/> 

Dr. Ronda Patrick discusses how [[deliberate_heat_exposure_and_cardiovascular_benefits | acclimating the body to heat]], a process she terms **hypothermic conditioning**, can induce physiological adaptations with numerous positive effects on endurance performance, muscle mass acquisition, and brain function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This approach can offer benefits similar to certain growth factors without the associated risks of high levels of growth hormone (GH) or supra-physiological levels of GH therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Relation to Growth Hormone (GH) and IGF-1

Previously, the speaker discussed the performance-longevity trade-off associated with growth hormone (GH) and IGF-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While IGF-1 has positive effects linked to youth, such as decreasing fat, increasing lean muscle mass, improving verbal memory, boosting neurogenesis (growth of new brain cells), and promoting muscle repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, genetically engineered animals with high GH or IGF-1 levels often have substantially shortened lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Hypothermic conditioning aims to achieve many of these positive effects without the risks associated with high GH levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Enhancements in Endurance Performance

[[deliberate_heat_exposure_and_cardiovascular_benefits | Heat acclimation]] through sauna use can significantly improve endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>:

*   **Increased Blood Flow to Muscles**: It enhances blood flow to skeletal muscles, delivering more glucose, esterified fatty acids, and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This reduces the reliance on local glycogen stores, which are often depleted during [[vigorous_exercise_and_adaptations | endurance training]] (the feeling of "hitting a wall") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. [[deliberate_heat_exposure_and_cardiovascular_benefits | Heat acclimation]] can reduce the need to rely on glycogen stores by 40-50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Reduced Cardiovascular Strain**: It increases blood flow to the heart, lowering cardiovascular strain and heart rate for a given [[vigorous_exercise_and_adaptations | exercise]] workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This allows physical activity to be sustained for longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Improved Thermoregulation**: [[deliberate_heat_exposure_and_cardiovascular_benefits | Heat acclimation]] increases blood flow to the skin and activates the sympathetic nervous system, allowing sweating to occur at a lower core body temperature and be maintained longer, thus lowering core body temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. It also releases norepinephrine, a vasodilator, which aids in more efficient heat dissipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Endurance Gains Study

In one study, male runners who used a sauna for 30 minutes twice a week after their workouts increased their running time until exhaustion by 32% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This was accompanied by a 7% increase in plasma volume and a 3.5% increase in red blood cell count, thought to be a compensatory mechanism for increased plasma volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Benefits for Muscle Hypertrophy

[[deliberate_heat_exposure_and_cardiovascular_benefits | Heat acclimation]] through sauna use can positively affect muscle hypertrophy (gaining muscle mass) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Muscle hypertrophy primarily involves increasing the size of muscle cells by boosting protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. While [[vigorous_exercise_and_adaptations | exercise]] increases net protein synthesis, it also leads to oxidative stress and protein degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Heat acclimation helps combat oxidative stress, resulting in a net increase in protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Three ways heat acclimation increases muscle hypertrophy:

1.  **Induction of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)**: Heat induces a robust production of HSPs, which is a prime example of hormesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. HSPs repair damaged proteins, prevent protein oxidation by scavenging free radicals, and increase endogenous antioxidants like glutathione, leading to a net increase in protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Acclimating to heat also results in higher basal expression of HSPs and a more robust induction during later core body temperature elevations (e.g., during [[vigorous_exercise_and_adaptations | exercise]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. One study in rats showed that hypothermic conditioning led to robust HSP induction, correlating with 30% more muscle regrowth after 7 days of immobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
2.  **Boosting Growth Hormone Levels**: The anabolic effects of growth hormone (GH) are well-known; for instance, GH administration to [[vigorous_exercise_and_adaptations | endurance athletes]] for 4 weeks resulted in 50% less protein oxidation and degradation, thus increasing muscle hypertrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Sauna use also affects GH levels, depending on temperature, time, and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   Two 20-minute sauna sessions a day at 80°C can double GH levels over baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   Two 1-hour daily sauna sessions at 80°C for 7 consecutive days resulted in a remarkable 16-fold increase in GH levels over baseline in men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
3.  **Improving Insulin Sensitivity**: Insulin is anabolic as it decreases protein degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. [[wholebody_hyperthermia_protocols | Whole-body hypothermia]] has been shown to reduce insulin resistance and improve insulin sensitivity in an obese diabetic mouse model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Heat stress, which boosts GH in humans, has also been shown to increase lifespan by about 15% in flies and worms, possibly due to hormesis inducing genes and proteins like HSPs that improve longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Positive Effects on Brain Function

Intermittent [[deliberate_heat_exposure_and_cardiovascular_benefits | heat exposure]] and [[deliberate_heat_exposure_and_cardiovascular_benefits | heat acclimation]] offer significant benefits to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, including:

*   Increased neurogenesis (growth of new brain cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
*   Improved learning and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>
*   Improved focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>

Sauna-induced hypothermia profoundly affects norepinephrine and prolactin levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. In one study, individuals in a sauna until exhaustion experienced a 310% increase in norepinephrine and a 10-fold increase in prolactin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Norepinephrine**: Helps with focus and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. [[deliberate_heat_exposure_and_cardiovascular_benefits | Heat acclimation]] also increases the biological capacity to store norepinephrine for later release, relevant for disorders like ADHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Prolactin**: Important for myelin growth, which increases the efficiency of electrical activity in the brain and aids in repairing nerve cell damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)

[[deliberate_heat_exposure_and_cardiovascular_benefits | Heat stress]] also increases neurogenesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Hypothermia combined with [[vigorous_exercise_and_adaptations | exercise]] increases the expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) even more than [[vigorous_exercise_and_adaptations | exercise]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. BDNF, often called "Miracle Grow for brain cells," promotes the growth of new brain cells and the survival of existing neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. It also increases neuronal plasticity, crucial for learning and retaining new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Furthermore, BDNF has been shown to decrease depression and anxiety associated with early life stressful events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, and can be released from muscle cells to promote muscle repair and growth of new muscle tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## The "Runner's High" Mechanism

The "runner's high" or general post-[[vigorous_exercise_and_adaptations | exercise]] high is not solely due to endorphins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. While endorphins (beta endorphins) are part of the body's natural mu-opioid painkiller system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, the kappa-opioid system's counterpart is dynorphin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Dynorphin causes feelings of dysphoria (the opposite of endorphin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The discomfort from intense [[vigorous_exercise_and_adaptations | exercise]], [[deliberate_heat_exposure_and_cardiovascular_benefits | heat stress]], or spicy foods is due to dynorphin release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This dynorphin release sensitizes the mu-opioid receptors to the feel-good endorphin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Hypothermia from sauna use increases dynorphin levels and subsequently, endorphin levels, even more than [[vigorous_exercise_and_adaptations | exercise]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

Hypothermic conditioning through sauna use, whether alongside or independent of [[vigorous_exercise_and_adaptations | exercise]], is a valuable tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It induces stress to build stress tolerance, suggesting caution and common sense in its application, especially considering individual body chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

It has been shown to:
*   **Improve endurance** by increasing nutrient delivery to muscles, reducing reliance on glycogen stores, improving cardiovascular mechanisms and heart rate, and enhancing thermoregulatory mechanisms to lower core body temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Improve muscle hypertrophy** by preventing protein degradation and causing a net increase in protein synthesis through:
    *   Inducing heat shock proteins, which also result from a hormetic response linked to longevity in lower organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
    *   Increasing growth hormone release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
    *   Improving insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Positively affect the brain** by increasing:
    *   Norepinephrine release and storage, important for focus and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
    *   Prolactin, which aids in brain function through myelination and nerve cell repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
    *   BDNF, which increases the growth of new brain cells, is important for learning and memory, and helps decrease depression and anxiety associated with early stressful events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   Increase dynorphin expression, sensitizing the body to the "feel-good" endorphin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Additionally, [[deliberate_heat_exposure_and_cardiovascular_benefits | heat stress]] has been shown to increase the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (also known as heat shock protein 32), which protects against the toxic effects of rhabdomyolysis in rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

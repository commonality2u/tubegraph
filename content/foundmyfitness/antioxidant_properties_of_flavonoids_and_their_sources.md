[[Role of plant phytochemicals in health | Flavonoids]] are compounds naturally produced by most plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. They exhibit potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, contributing to overall health and protection against various age-related diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Sources
Common dietary sources of flavonoids include:
*   **Apple Peel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>: Contains specific flavonoids such as quercetin and epicatechin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Blueberries** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>: Rich in anthocyanins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Antioxidant Properties
Flavonoids offer significant protection against cellular damage through several mechanisms:
*   **Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Scavenging** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>: Flavonoids are highly effective at sequestering reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced within cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cellular Protection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>: By neutralizing ROS, they protect cells from various types of damage, including:
    *   [[Impact of antioxidants on DNA damage and cancer | DNA damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
    *   Damage to lipids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
    *   Damage to proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
    These types of damage contribute to the development of diseases of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Activation of Detoxification Enzymes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>: Flavonoids activate Phase two detoxification enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. These are a host of enzymes that serve as antioxidant enzymes and are related to anti-inflammatory processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This mechanism is similar to how [[Sulforaphanes Role in Antiaging and Inflammation Reduction | isothiocyanates]] function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Inflammation Reduction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>: Flavonoids help lower inflammation by inhibiting genes that activate inflammatory pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

In summary, flavonoids are crucial for lowering oxidation and inflammation in the body through these general mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

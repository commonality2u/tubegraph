Cancer is a complex disease where a comprehensive understanding of its initiation and progression is still developing, especially when compared to [[Cardiovascular disease and prevention | cardiovascular disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. This means that while prevention strategies are important, aggressive screening plays a crucial role in improving outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:01">[21:10:01]</a>.

## Cancer Risk Factors
Age is the greatest non-modifiable risk factor for cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:38">[02:08:38]</a>. The leading modifiable risk factor for cancer globally and in the U.S. is smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:55">[02:08:55]</a>. After smoking, [[obesity and cancer | obesity]] is the second largest modifiable risk factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:50">[02:16:50]</a>.

### Obesity and Cancer
Obesity's link to cancer is primarily due to the environment of growth factors and inflammation it creates, rather than just the excess adiposity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:42">[02:09:42]</a>. This includes:
*   **Hyperinsulinemia** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:44">[02:09:44]</a>
*   **Chronically elevated IGF** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>
*   **Inflammatory environment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:53">[02:09:53]</a>

Fat accumulation becomes problematic when it escapes subcutaneous storage depots and surrounds organs (visceral fat), or accumulates in the liver, heart, pancreas, or kidneys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:29">[02:10:29]</a>. Even a small amount of fat in these places can significantly increase cardiometabolic disease risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>. Visceral fat is highly correlated with increased cancer risk, and specific inflammatory cytokines are associated with visceral fat and cancer incidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.

## Importance of Early Detection
Unlike [[Cardiovascular disease and prevention | cardiovascular disease]], which has a clearer understanding of its pathogenesis, [[Cancer development and its relationship with cellular senescence | cancer]] is still largely a "big black box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:51">[02:12:51]</a>. Many individuals who lead perfectly healthy lives and avoid known risk factors still develop cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:01">[02:13:01]</a>. Since modifiable risk factors don't account for even half of cancer cases, aggressive screening becomes critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:42">[02:13:42]</a>.

The fundamental truth about cancer is that treating it in an early stage leads to a better outcome than treating it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:25">[02:14:25]</a>. For example, a person with Stage III colon cancer (spread to lymph nodes, but not visibly beyond) who receives standard chemotherapy has a 65% chance of being alive in 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:24">[02:15:24]</a>. If that same patient has visible metastatic disease in the liver (Stage IV) after surgery, none of them will be alive in 5 years, despite receiving the same chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:46">[02:15:46]</a>. This drastic difference applies to all cancers: the more cancer cells and heterogeneity of mutations, the harder it is to treat and evade the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:04">[02:16:04]</a>. Catching cancer as early as possible minimizes the disease burden for treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:39">[02:16:39]</a>.

## Cancer Screening Modalities
Aggressive cancer screening involves weighing the benefits against the risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:12">[02:14:12]</a>. Key considerations include:
*   **Economic Cost:** Many aggressive screening methods are outside standard insurance coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:31">[02:18:31]</a>.
*   **Emotional Cost of False Positives:** Understanding the sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive value of tests is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:22">[02:19:22]</a>. High positive predictive value means the test is likely accurate if positive, and high negative predictive value means it's likely accurate if negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:03">[02:20:03]</a>.

### Specific Screening Tests

#### Breast Cancer
*   **Mammography:** Has a sensitivity of ~90% and specificity of ~85% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, but the pre-test probability for a young woman is low, leading to poor positive/negative predictive values in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">[02:21:17]</a>. Mammography is good at seeing calcified lesions but bad at non-calcified lesions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:09">[02:22:09]</a>.
*   **Ultrasound and MRI:** MRI is good at seeing non-calcified lesions and is not affected by dense glandular tissue in younger women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:19">[02:22:19]</a>. Combining tests increases positive and negative predictive value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:28">[02:22:28]</a>.
*   **Radiation Concern:** Mammography has incredibly low radiation exposure, comparable to a fraction of the environmental exposure in a year or significantly less than older CT scans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:39">[02:33:39]</a>. Avoiding mammograms due to radiation fears, especially for women with a 1 in 8 lifetime risk, is not justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:17">[02:35:17]</a>.
*   **Screening Recommendations (No family history/risk factors):** Start mammogram and ultrasound at age 40, potentially mammogram annually and ultrasound every six months (staggered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:02">[02:25:02]</a>. Stage I breast cancer is often non-fatal, while Stage IV is uniformly fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:38">[02:25:38]</a>.

#### Colon Cancer
*   **Colonoscopy:** Considered a test with 100% sensitivity and very high specificity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:44">[02:22:44]</a>. The risk of harm (dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, sedation, perforation, bleeding) is physical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:55">[02:22:55]</a>. Recent studies show it is very safe in good hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:36">[02:23:36]</a>.
*   **Screening Recommendations (No family history/risk factors):** Start at age 40, then every 3-5 years depending on findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:20">[02:24:20]</a>.

#### Lung Cancer
*   **Low-dose CT scan:** Justified for former or current smokers, as 85% of lung cancers occur in these groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:30">[02:32:30]</a>. It best detects small cell, large cell, and squamous cell cancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:06">[02:33:06]</a>.
*   **MRI:** Recommended for non-smokers to detect adenocarcinoma, avoiding radiation exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:14">[02:33:14]</a>.
*   Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally and in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:38">[02:32:38]</a>.

#### Liquid Biopsies
*   Tests like Grail's Galleri look for cell-free DNA in the blood to detect cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:36">[02:26:36]</a>.
*   They analyze known cancer mutations (e.g., KRAS, p53), DNA fragment length, and most importantly, methylation patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>.
*   Methylation patterns can indicate the likelihood of cancer and the tissue of origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:52">[02:27:52]</a>.
*   Grail tests have high specificity (unlikely to give a false positive) but lower sensitivity for early-stage (Stage I/II) breast cancer overall (around 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:12">[02:29:12]</a>. However, for aggressive breast cancers (ER/PR negative), sensitivity increases significantly to 75-80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:17">[02:30:17]</a>. This implies they are catching the cancers that "matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:51">[02:30:51]</a>.
*   Liquid biopsies are particularly good for blood cancers (leukemias, myeloma) due to the higher concentration of cell-free DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:45">[02:36:45]</a>.
*   Currently, liquid biopsies are often used in combination with morphology tests (MRI, ultrasound, mammography) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:11">[02:31:11]</a>. The hope is that someday, only a liquid biopsy will be needed, followed by morphologic surveys if positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:31">[02:31:31]</a>.
*   These tests typically cost around $900-$1000 and usually require a doctor's order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:10">[02:37:10]</a>.

## Cancer Prevention Strategies (Lifestyle)

While screening is crucial, preventive lifestyle factors remain important for [[Prevention and risk factors of cancer through exercise | cancer prevention and treatment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:47">[02:08:47]</a>.

### Metabolic Health
*   Maintaining metabolic health is crucial for cancer prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:27">[02:28:27]</a>.
*   **Glucose Regulation:** Elevated glucose levels are chronically toxic to small vessels, contributing to microvascular damage in eyes, kidneys, heart, and brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>. Elevated insulin levels are damaging to large blood vessels (aorta, iliac, carotid arteries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:06">[01:45:06]</a>. As glucose levels rise, the body produces more insulin to overcome cellular [[obesity and cancer | insulin resistance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:30">[01:45:30]</a>. Postprandial hyperinsulinemia is a "metabolic harbinger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:53">[01:45:53]</a>.
*   **Dietary Choices:**
    *   **Carbohydrate Restriction:** Most effective for triglyceride reduction, which is a proxy for insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. Refined and starchy carbohydrates specifically affect this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.
    *   **Saturated Fat Consumption:** Impacts cholesterol synthesis and inhibits the sterol regulatory binding protein in the liver, leading to fewer LDL receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.
    *   **Individual Variability:** Response to saturated fat intake varies; some individuals show no adverse lipid changes, while others see their lipids go "haywire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. Swapping saturated fat with monounsaturated fat can fix lipid problems in about half of hyper-responders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.
*   **Energy Balance:** Crucial for managing insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:20">[01:46:20]</a>.
*   **Sleep:** Acute and chronic sleep disruptions impair glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:28">[01:47:28]</a>.
*   **Stress Management:** Hypercortisolemia contributes to insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Exercise and adequate sleep aid in balancing cortisol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:59">[02:11:59]</a>.

### Exercise
*   [[Prevention and risk factors of cancer through exercise | Exercise]] is likely the single most important factor for increasing insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>.
*   Muscle contraction directly increases glucose transporters to the cell surface in an insulin-independent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:20">[01:42:20]</a>.
*   Even [[exercise_during_cancer_treatment | exercise during cancer treatment]] can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:15">[02:17:15]</a>.
*   **Metabolic Flexibility:** The capability to shift between using glucose and fatty acids as fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:31">[01:53:31]</a>. This is enhanced by Zone 2 training, where individuals can utilize fatty acids for oxidative phosphorylation under increasing demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>.
*   **VO2 Max:** A key metric of health and longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:36">[02:06:36]</a>. Studies show that being in the top 2.5% of VO2 max compared to the bottom 25% is associated with a 400% lower all-cause mortality risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:11">[02:07:11]</a>.
*   **Training Ratio:** World-class endurance athletes typically train with an 80/20 split: 80% Zone 2 training and 20% high-intensity interval training (V2 Max) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:50">[01:55:50]</a>. Zone 2 builds aerobic base, while V2 Max training improves capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:21">[01:56:21]</a>.

## Hormones and Cancer Risk

### Female Hormones (Menopause and HRT)
Menopause involves a rapid decline in estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:15">[02:38:15]</a>. This leads to:
*   **Short-term:** Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats), brain fog, sleep disturbances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:49">[02:39:49]</a>.
*   **Long-term:** Sexual changes (vaginal atrophy, dryness, reduced libido), and significant bone density destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:50">[02:40:50]</a>. Bone mineral density declines sharply after menopause, increasing the risk of falls and fractures later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:48">[02:41:48]</a>.

#### Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)
HRT is often justified to alleviate symptoms and mitigate long-term risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:18">[02:42:18]</a>.
*   **The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study:** This 2001-2002 study was largely misinterpreted, leading to a widespread misconception that HRT increases breast cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:42">[02:42:42]</a>.
    *   The study used conjugated equine estrogen (CE) and synthetic progestin (MPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:28">[02:45:28]</a>.
    *   Women in the CE + MPA group showed a 0.1% higher absolute risk of breast cancer (5 cases per 1000 women vs. 4 in placebo), which was a 25% relative increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:24">[02:46:24]</a>. However, there was no difference in breast cancer mortality, even with 19-year follow-up data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:16">[02:47:16]</a>.
    *   The CE-alone group actually had a *lower* incidence and mortality of breast cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:58">[02:47:58]</a>. This suggests MPA, not estrogen, was the culprit for the slight increase in breast cancer incidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:28">[02:48:28]</a>. MPA is rarely used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:51">[02:48:51]</a>.
    *   The study population was considerably older (7-10 years post-menopause on average) and generally unhealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:54">[02:45:54]</a>.
*   **Modern HRT:**
    *   Uses bioidentical hormones (estradiol, estriol, micronized oral progesterone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:49">[02:50:49]</a>.
    *   Oral estrogen is largely avoided due to a small but non-zero risk of hypercoagulability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:50">[02:52:50]</a>.
    *   Preferred delivery methods: topical estradiol patches (e.g., Vivelle Dot) or occasionally pellets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:08">[02:53:08]</a>.
    *   Progesterone is given orally (100-200mg daily) or via IUD to prevent endometrial hyperplasia if the uterus is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:50">[02:44:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:02">[02:49:02]</a>.
    *   Dosage aims to bring FSH levels down to about 25, which is lower than pre-menopausal levels but sufficient for symptom relief and bone preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:05">[02:58:05]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Early HRT:** Initiating HRT at the time of menopause does not increase the risk of heart disease or breast cancer; in fact, it reduces the risk of heart disease, dementia, and preserves bone mineral density. It is either protective or neutral on cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:02">[03:01:02]</a>.
    *   Late initiation (e.g., 10+ years post-menopause) *may* be counterproductive for Alzheimer's disease risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:14">[02:59:14]</a>. Early initiation appears beneficial for APOE4-positive women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:26">[02:59:26]</a>.
*   **Testosterone in Women:** Important for libido, orgasmic function, arousal, and maintaining muscle mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Replacement aims for levels seen in a woman's 30s-40s (about 1/10th of a typical male dose) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>.

### Male Hormones (Testosterone Replacement Therapy - TRT)
*   Male testosterone levels decline gradually starting in the 20s-30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:39">[03:20:39]</a>.
*   "Low T" is a combination of symptoms (reduced libido, energy, mood) and biochemical levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:08">[03:21:08]</a>. Direct measurement of free testosterone is an estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** Can improve libido, energy, mood, insulin sensitivity, muscle mass, and exercise recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:15">[03:23:15]</a>.
*   **Prostate:** TRT does *not* increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer; lower testosterone is associated with a higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>. However, it can potentially increase prostate size (BPH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:23">[03:27:23]</a>.
*   **Other Side Effects:** Can drive hair loss (in susceptible individuals) and increase acne, typically seen with supraphysiologic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:32">[03:27:32]</a>. Strategies like 5-alpha reductase inhibitors can block testosterone conversion to DHT, which drives hair loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:14">[03:28:14]</a>.
*   **Cardiovascular Risk:** A large study showed a slight short-term increase in cardiovascular events in high-risk men on TRT, possibly due to increased blood pressure, which vanished at 2-3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:50">[03:28:50]</a>. It's important to manage other risk factors, like blood pressure, before initiating TRT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:32">[03:29:32]</a>.
*   **Administration:** Injections are generally preferred over gels for more consistent levels, ideally twice a week at a lower dose (e.g., 40-50mg twice weekly for a total of 80-100mg/week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:19">[03:26:19]</a>.

## Key Biomarkers and Functional Tests (Relevance to Cancer Prevention/Risk)

*   **APOB:** While primarily a marker for [[Cardiovascular disease and prevention | atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease]], managing it contributes to overall metabolic health, which is relevant to cancer prevention. The concentration of all APOB particles is the best predictor of atherosclerosis risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
*   **Glucose Regulation:**
    *   **Fasting blood glucose:** 100 mg/dL is on the cusp of being too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>.
    *   **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c):** Lower is better, even outside the diabetic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:10">[01:49:10]</a>. An A1c of 5% (average blood glucose ~100 mg/dL) is associated with better outcomes than 5.5% (average blood glucose ~115 mg/dL), both considered normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:12">[01:50:12]</a>.
    *   **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs):** Can track average blood glucose, postprandial spikes, and variability, giving indirect insights into insulin secretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:08">[01:51:08]</a>.
*   **Mitochondrial Function:**
    *   **Zone 2 Training with Lactate Production:** Considered the best measurement of mitochondrial function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. It involves exercising at an intensity where lactate levels remain below ~2 mmol/L, indicating efficient oxidative phosphorylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.
    *   **VO2 Max Test (CPET):** Measures oxygen consumed (VO2) and carbon dioxide produced (VCO2) during exercise, and their ratio (RQ or RER) indicates fat vs. carbohydrate oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:56">[01:59:56]</a>. Peak fat oxidation and the wattage at which it occurs are important metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.
*   **Cholesterol Synthesis Markers:**
    *   **Desmosterol:** A proxy for brain cholesterol synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. Very low levels (below 0.8 mg/dL) are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a>.
    *   **Lathosterol:** A proxy for peripheral cholesterol synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>.
    *   These are specialized measurements not typically found in standard labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>.
*   **Vitamin D:** Avoiding vitamin D deficiency is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:22">[03:12:22]</a>. There is cross-talk between vitamin D and estrogen in regulating genes, suggesting vitamin D may compensate for some effects of low estrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:20">[03:05:20]</a>. Optimal levels (e.g., 50-60 ng/mL or higher) are still debated but associated with lower all-cause mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:31">[03:08:31]</a>.
*   **Homocysteine:** Elevated homocysteine impairs the clearance of ADMA and SDMA, which directly and indirectly inhibit nitric oxide synthase, impacting blood vessel function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:15">[03:35:15]</a>. Supplementing with B vitamins (e.g., methylfolate) and cocoa flavanols can lower homocysteine and improve blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:46">[03:33:46]</a>.
*   **Blood Pressure:** Aim for 120/80 mmHg or better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:46">[03:29:46]</a>. Losing weight and exercising can significantly improve blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:24">[03:30:24]</a>. Automated home blood pressure cuffs, used consistently at rest following a 5-minute protocol, provide the most accurate readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:28">[03:36:28]</a>.

## Personal Health Optimization
For personal longevity, comprehensive health optimization often involves:
*   **Sleep:** Consistent bedtime/wake time (e.g., 10 PM - 6 AM resulting in 7.5 hours of sleep), using cooling mattress covers (e.g., Eight Sleep), avoiding activating content before bed, and utilizing supplements like glycine, ashwagandha, and magnesium L-threonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:27">[03:32:27]</a>.
*   **Nutrition:** Focus on energy balance and high protein intake (e.g., 40-50g protein four times a day). Avoiding "junk" food is a primary tenet. Stop eating at least 3 hours before bed to improve sleep quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:02">[03:46:02]</a>.
*   **Alcohol:** No biochemical benefit at any dose, but social benefits may exist. Limiting intake (e.g., 0-8 drinks per week, no more than 2 in a day) and consuming earlier in the evening can mitigate negative impacts on sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:56">[03:47:56]</a>.
*   **Exercise:** Daily exercise, including ~4 hours of Zone 2 cardio and one higher-intensity V2 Max workout per week, plus four strength training sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:02">[03:49:02]</a>.

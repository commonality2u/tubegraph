Hormesis refers to the exposure to a low level of something that, at very high levels, could be toxic or detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. The principle of hormesis states that applying a small amount of stress activates beneficial genes in the body, where the positive activation of these genes outweighs the small amount of stress applied, resulting in a net beneficial effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. Throughout human evolution, people were naturally exposed to these intermittent types of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. However, modern living has reduced this exposure, which is believed to have a detrimental effect on [[epigenetics_and_aging | aging]] and susceptibility to [[role_of_inflammation_in_aging_and_disease | age-related diseases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.

## How Hormesis Works
When the body is exposed to a hormetic stressor, various stress response genes are activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. These include:
*   Antioxidant genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>
*   Anti-inflammatory genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>
*   Genes involved in autophagy (clearing out damaged cellular components) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>
*   Genes for repairing DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>
*   Heat shock proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>

The activation of these genes helps the body to "clean up stuff" and combat daily damage from normal metabolism, immune activation, and environmental factors like air pollution and chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. Turning on these stress response genes is crucial for healthy aging and even normal aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>.

## Examples of Hormetic Stressors
Specific examples of hormetic stressors include:

### Exercise
Exercise is highly beneficial, but continuous, non-stop exercise would be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. Physical activity, particularly vigorous intensity exercise like "exercise snacks" (1-3 minutes, three times a day), can lead to 30-40% lower all-cause and cancer-related mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>. While exercise activates inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, it also triggers a more powerful and sustained anti-inflammatory response, with IL-10 being activated, resulting in a net anti-inflammatory effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.

### Fasting (Food Scarcity)
Periods of food scarcity, common in human evolution before modern conveniences, activate stress response genes, including autophagy genes, which are involved in clearing damaged cellular components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

### Hot and Cold Therapies
Exposure to heat stress, such as through saunas or hot tubs, also activates a variety of stress response genes, including heat shock proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.

### Plant Phytochemicals
Certain compounds found in plants are also considered hormetic. These [[hormesis_and_plant_phytochemicals | plant phytochemicals]] activate stress response genes and have effects that overlap with those activated by physical activity or heat stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>. Examples include:
*   [[role_of_sulforaphane_in_aging and longevity | Sulforaphane]] from cruciferous plants like broccoli sprouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>
*   Resveratrol, found in the skin of grapes and blueberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>
*   Pterostilbene, also found in the skin of blueberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>
*   Curcumin from turmeric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>

## Hormesis and Healthy Aging
Engaging in these intermittent types of stress is very important for healthy aging and for reducing predisposition to [[cellular_senescence_and_aging | age-related diseases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. The benefits extend to cleaning up damaged cellular components, boosting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses, preventing protein aggregation, and repairing damaged DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. This concept of [[hormesis_and_resilience_through_shortterm_stressors | hormesis and resilience through short-term stressors]] underpins many lifestyle recommendations for longevity and well-being.

Dr. Dale Bredesen is an internationally recognized expert in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He holds faculty positions at UCLA and the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, where he was the founding president and CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Dr. Bredesen is also the author of the *New York Times* best-selling book "The End of Alzheimer's Disease," which details a [[Multipronged protocol for Alzheimers | multi-pronged protocol]] for [[Preventing Alzheimers Disease | preventing]] and treating mild cognitive impairment and [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## Understanding Alzheimer's Disease Pathology
Cognitive decline is very common, with [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] being its most frequent cause, ultimately leading to dementia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. By definition, [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] is characterized by amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau tangles in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. However, these are markers, not necessarily the sole cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. It's possible to have similar cognitive decline without amyloid, or amyloid without cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

The understanding of [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] is evolving, moving beyond the historical vilification of amyloid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. While amyloid is a neurotoxin with toxic effects, it is also a protectant produced by the brain in response to specific insults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Research by Professor Rudy Tanzi and Professor Robert Moir has shown amyloid to be an antimicrobial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, and Professor Ashley Bush demonstrated its ability to bind divalent metals like copper, zinc, and iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Dr. Bredesen's team found it responds to a reduction in trophic support, leading to a change in signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

The brain produces amyloid in response to various insults and metabolic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. While amyloid production increases the risk for degeneration, many individuals produce it successfully as a protective measure without experiencing cognitive downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Inflammation is a general factor that can worsen outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Dr. Bredesen's research has identified 36 contributing factors, which broadly fall into a few categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

## [[Subtypes of Alzheimers Disease | Subtypes of Alzheimer's Disease]]
Dr. Bredesen classifies [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] into several subtypes based on the primary contributing factors:

*   **Type 1: Inflammatory or "Hot" Alzheimer's** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>: Caused by pathogens or chronic inflammation, such as from a leaky gut, *P. gingivalis* in the brain, Borrelia (Lyme disease), or specific fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Amyloid acts like "napalm," killing invaders but also reducing "arable soil" in the brain, leading to network downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Type 2: Atrophic or "Cold" Alzheimer's** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>: Characterized by decreased trophic support, meaning insufficient levels of factors critical for synaptogenesis like nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), estradiol, testosterone, pregnenolone, progesterone, thyroid hormones, and [[Genetic factors and vitamin Ds role in mitigating Alzheimers risk | vitamin D]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. This imbalance shifts the ratio from synaptoblastic (making and storing synapses) to synaptoclastic (pulling back and reorganizing synapses), leading to the downsizing of the neural network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.
*   **Type 1.5: Glycotoxic Alzheimer's** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>: Combines features of inflammatory and atrophic types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. It's driven by [[Alzheimers Disease and Insulin Sensitivity | insulin resistance]] due to chronic high insulin, which changes signaling and reduces insulin's trophic support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. Glycation of proteins (measurable as hemoglobin A1C) also contributes to inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.
*   **Type 3: Toxic or "Vile" Alzheimer's** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>: A response to toxins such as metalotoxins (e.g., mercury), organic toxins (e.g., DDE), and biotoxins produced by molds (e.g., trycothesinson, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin, gliotoxin from *Stachybotrys*, *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
*   **Type 4: Vascular Component** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>
*   **Type 5: Traumatic Component** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>

All subtypes share the pathological hallmarks of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, but their clinical presentations can differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Type 1, 1.5, and 2 typically present with amnestic (memory) issues, more common with [[Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimers | ApoE4]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. Type 3 often presents non-amnestically, with executive dysfunction, calculation problems, visual perception issues, or word-finding difficulties (primary progressive aphasia), often in younger, [[Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimers | ApoE4]]-negative individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

### Zinc Deficiency in Type 3 Alzheimer's
Many individuals with Type 3 [[Subtypes of Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's]] exhibit low serum zinc, high copper-zinc ratios, and low triglycerides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. Zinc and copper compete for absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. Zinc deficiency is common globally, exacerbated by poor gastric acidity (e.g., with age or PPI use) and copper piping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. High copper-zinc ratios have been linked to dementia for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>. Zinc is vital for hundreds of enzymes, functioning as a structural component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. It's crucial for cognitive decline-related processes, diabetes, insulin function, trophic activity of insulin, and immune responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. Therefore, low zinc can be a biomarker for underlying issues in toxic [[Subtypes of Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

## [[Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimers | Genetic Factors and Risk Assessment]]

### [[Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimers | ApoE4]]
[[Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimers | Apolipoprotein E]] (ApoE) is the most significant [[Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimers | genetic risk factor]] for [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. Everyone carries two copies of either ApoE2, E3, or E4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>. ApoE3 is the most common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>.
*   About 75 million Americans (a quarter of the population) have one copy of [[Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimers | ApoE4]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. This was the primordial variant, present for about 96% of hominid evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.
*   About 7 million Americans have two copies ([[Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimers | ApoE4]] homozygous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.

Lifetime risk of [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] by ApoE genotype:
*   Zero copies (e.g., 3,3): ~9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>
*   One copy (e.g., 3,4): ~30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>
*   Two copies (4,4): Over 50%, potentially up to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>

Historically, people were advised not to check their ApoE status because there was "nothing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. This has completely changed; [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] should become a rare condition with current knowledge and intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.

### The "Cognoscopy" and Biomarkers
Dr. Bredesen recommends that everyone 45 or older undergo a "cognoscopy" â€“ a series of tests to assess risk factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. This includes:
*   **Genetic testing**: For [[Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimers | ApoE4]] status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.
*   **Inflammation markers**: hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>.
*   **Methylation status**: Homocysteine (aim for <7 mcmol/L, not the lab's typical <13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>. High homocysteine is linked to more rapid decline in cerebral grey matter and hippocampal volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>. Improving homocysteine levels can halt this decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>.
*   **[[Alzheimers Disease and Insulin Sensitivity | Glycotoxicity]]**: Fasting insulin (optimally <5 mIU/L), hemoglobin A1C, and fasting glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>. These markers are critical for Type 1.5 [[Subtypes of Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. Professor Ed Goetzl's research shows a signature of [[Alzheimers Disease and Insulin Sensitivity | insulin resistance]] in neural exosomes of [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's patients]], even if not evident peripherally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Trophic support**: [[Genetic factors and vitamin Ds role in mitigating Alzheimers risk | Vitamin D]] (optimal levels), pregnenolone, progesterone, estradiol, testosterone, free T3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>. BDNF and NGF can be inferred from hippocampal volume and lifestyle factors like exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>.
*   **Toxin exposure**: Especially mycotoxins (e.g., via ERMI scores, urine tests for ochratoxin A, aflatoxin, gliotoxin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a>, metalotoxins (e.g., mercury), organic toxins (e.g., DDE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
*   **History of head trauma and vascular compromise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:03:00">[27:03:00]</a>.

## The ReCODE Protocol: A [[Multipronged protocol for Alzheimers | Programmatic Approach]]
Dr. Bredesen's protocol, initially called MEND (Metabolic Enhancement for Neurodegeneration), is now known as ReCODE (Reversal of Cognitive Decline) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>. It's a sophisticated, personalized program that addresses the multiple contributing factors to [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>. Over 3,000 individuals are on this protocol, with published results showing unprecedented improvement, including cases where individuals returned to work and showed brain mass returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.

The core principle is to address the underlying causes of the disease, rather than just treating symptoms with mono-therapeutics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.

### Key Components of the ReCODE Protocol:

1.  **Diet: Ketoflex 12/3** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>
    *   **Keto**: Aims for mild ketosis (1.5-4 mmol/L beta-hydroxybutyrate) for improved cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:00">[33:52:00]</a>. This involves a very low-carbohydrate, high-good-fat diet (avocados, nuts, seeds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>. MCT oil or coconut oil can help initiate ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Flexitarian**: Plant-rich diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>. Meat is seen as a condiment; if consumed, it should be pastured chicken or grass-fed beef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a>. Wild-caught fish (e.g., "SMASH" fish: salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines, herring) are encouraged, while large, long-lived fish high in mercury (tuna, shark, swordfish) should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a>.
    *   **12/3**:
        *   **Minimum 12-hour fast** between dinner and breakfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>. For [[Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimers | ApoE4]]-positive individuals, this should be extended to 14-16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:00">[31:13:00]</a>. Fasting induces ketosis and promotes autophagy and glymphatic system clearance, which cleans out the brain during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46:00">[31:46:00]</a>.
        *   **3 hours before bed** without eating after dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>. This prevents high insulin levels from negatively impacting cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:00">[32:25:00]</a>.
    *   **Organic food**: To minimize exposure to dementogens (toxins that cause dementia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:00">[32:39:00]</a>.
    *   **Considerations**: Individuals with low BMI may need to liberalize the diet once a week with more carbohydrates to avoid weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:28:00">[31:28:00]</a>. [[Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimers | ApoE4]] carriers, after becoming insulin sensitive, should transition from saturated fats (like MCT oil used for initial ketosis) to more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats to optimize cardiovascular health (e.g., keeping LDL particle number below 1000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:05:00">[34:05:00]</a>.
    *   It takes a few weeks to shift from carbohydrate-based to fat-based metabolism, which can lead to "keto flu" if done too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31:00">[35:31:00]</a>. Exercise can help this conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>.

2.  **Addressing Pathogens and Toxins**:
    *   Treating underlying infections like Lyme disease and co-infections (Bartonella, Babesia, Ehrlichia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.
    *   Detecting and mitigating exposure to toxins, including mold mycotoxins (e.g., via ERMI score from mycometrics.com and urinary mycotoxin tests), and heavy metals like mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a>.

3.  **Exercise**: Essential for increasing BDNF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a> and supporting metabolic flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>.

4.  **Sleep**: Crucial for the glymphatic system to clear waste from the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>. Poor sleep contributes to cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:05:00">[40:05:00]</a>. See also: [[Relationship between sleep and Alzheimers disease]]

5.  **Stress Reduction**: Stress levels are surprisingly important factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:45:00">[54:45:00]</a>.

6.  **Sauna Use**: Part of the protocol for detoxification, especially for hydrophobic toxins and heavy metals like cadmium and mercury, which are excreted in sweat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:36:00">[52:36:00]</a>. Regular sauna use also has cardiovascular benefits related to dementia prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:12:00">[54:12:00]</a>. After sweating, a non-emollient soap should be used immediately to prevent re-penetration of toxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:00:00">[54:00:00]</a>.

7.  **Gut Health**: A common contributor to chronic inflammatory conditions like [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:22:00">[41:22:00]</a>. Markers include Cyrex Array 2 (for LPS antibodies) and Array 3 (for gluten/gliadin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:59:00">[55:59:00]</a>, and Genova Diagnostics' GI Effects stool analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:33:00">[56:33:00]</a>.

8.  **Nutritional Support**: Ensuring adequate precursors for synapse formation and maintenance, such as DHA and acetylcholine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:53:00">[49:53:00]</a>. Omega-3s and their derivatives (maresins, resolvins) are crucial for resolving inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:32:00">[46:32:00]</a>. While DHA supplementation for ApoE4 carriers might have transport defects across the [[Bloodbrain barrier breakdown and its link to Alzheimers | blood-brain barrier]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:49:00">[48:49:00]</a>, whole fish provides additional protective antioxidants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:44:00">[47:44:00]</a>. DHA is also important for glucose transporters on the [[Bloodbrain barrier breakdown and its link to Alzheimers | blood-brain barrier]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>.

## Challenges with Monotherapies
Past clinical trials targeting only amyloid beta plaques have largely failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:20:00">[56:20:00]</a>. This is because amyloid, while a mediator of pathophysiology, is also a protectant produced in response to pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:42:00">[56:42:00]</a>. Simply removing amyloid without addressing its underlying causes (pathogens, toxins, metabolic changes) can be counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:09:00">[57:09:00]</a>. [[Reversing Alzheimers Disease | Alzheimer's disease]] is a complex chronic illness with dozens of contributing factors, making a multi-pronged, personalized approach essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:54:00">[57:54:00]</a>.

More information about the ReCODE protocol can be found in Dr. Bredesen's book "The End of Alzheimer's" and on his website, drbredesen.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>. A second book with more specific resources is also forthcoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.

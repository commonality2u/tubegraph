Dr. Anna Patrick consumes a daily micronutrient smoothie, totaling around 64 fluid ounces, sharing half with her husband Dan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This smoothie is specifically designed to deliver a high amount of beneficial micronutrients, including a significant dose of [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Sources of Magnesium

A common factor among the green leafy vegetables in Dr. Patrick's smoothie is their high [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | Magnesium]] is situated at the center of the chlorophyll molecule, which is responsible for giving plants their green color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Therefore, consuming green plants helps ensure adequate [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Key green leafy vegetables included in the smoothie, which are high in [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]], are:
*   Eight kale leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
*   Four rainbow chard leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Three cups of spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>

The entire smoothie provides approximately 588 milligrams of [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]], which exceeds the recommended daily allowance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Magnesium Deficiency in the U.S.

Around 45% of the U.S. population does not meet the adequate intake for [[magnesium_deficiency_and_its_health_effects | magnesium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The adequate intake for [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] is currently set at approximately 350 to 400 milligrams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Athletes may require 10 to 15 percent, or even more, above this amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## The Role of Magnesium in the Body

[[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | Magnesium]] is crucial for various biological processes:
*   **Enzyme Function** Over 300 different enzymes in the body require [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] to function correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This includes enzymes involved in the production and utilization of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energetic currency of the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. ATP must also be bound to a [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] ion to be biologically active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Energy production and utilization are essential for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, so the body prioritizes allocating [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] to these energy-producing enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **DNA Repair and Replication** [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | Magnesium]] is required by DNA repair enzymes, which fix damage to DNA that occurs from normal metabolism and immune function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This repair prevents mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Additionally, [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] is needed for DNA polymerases and DNA ligase, enzymes that ensure mutations do not occur during cell replication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Cancer Prevention** Due to its role in DNA repair and replication, [[importance_of_magnesium_for_health | magnesium]] is very important in preventing cancer-initiating factors, such as DNA damage and mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

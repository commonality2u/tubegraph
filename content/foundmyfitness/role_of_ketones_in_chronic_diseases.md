Dr. Dom D'Agostino, an associate professor at the University of South Florida and a research scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, focuses his research on [[metabolic_therapies_in_disease_management | metabolic therapies]], including ketogenic diets and [[therapeutic_benefits_of_ketone_supplementation | ketone supplements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. He emphasizes that "keto" has become a brand in popular culture, losing its meaning as a distinct metabolic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. A ketogenic diet is uniquely defined by an objective biomarker: ketones, measured in blood, urine, or breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Technical adherence to a ketogenic diet requires a state of hyperketonemia (elevated ketones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Achieving higher ketone levels, which are therapeutically linked to treating certain conditions, requires a high-fat diet with low carbohydrates and moderate protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Ketogenic Diets and Ketosis

Ketosis is produced by a ketogenic diet through the suppression of insulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This process mimics fasting by depleting liver glycogen and accelerating fatty acid beta-oxidation, leading to ketone body production (acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

There are various forms of ketogenic diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>:
*   **Classical Ketogenic Diet:** A 4:1 ratio (fat to protein/carbohydrates), meaning 90% fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, primarily used for pediatric epilepsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. In extreme cases, a 5:1 ratio is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Modified Ketogenic Diet / Modified Atkins / Low Glycemic Index Therapy (LGIT):** More liberal versions, such as a 1:1 ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, or a 1.5:1 ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. These can produce a mild state of ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a> and may have benefits even with low or no ketones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, partly by suppressing insulin and altering other pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

For individuals starting a ketogenic diet, it is recommended to gradually titrate carbohydrates down over four to six weeks, especially if not managing a severe disorder like epilepsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This approach can improve compliance and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, reducing side effects such as sleep disruption, lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, quick LDL spike) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Calorie restriction with a ketogenic diet can mitigate negative associations with high-fat diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

### Important Dietary Considerations
*   **Fiber:** Incorporating fiber, especially from raw leafy greens, is crucial for preserving the gut microbiome and moderating digestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. Cooking vegetables can rupture cell walls, making carbohydrates more accessible and potentially impacting ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Fat Types:** Monounsaturated fatty acids (e.g., from avocados, olive oil, salmon) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are preferred over long-chain saturated fats, especially for individuals with APOE4 alleles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>. MCTs can also raise ketone levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Protein:** Large amounts of protein, such as whey protein or branched-chain amino acids, can cause an insulin response and potentially kick one out of ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Consuming fat and fiber with protein can help attenuate the insulin response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
*   **Micronutrients:** There has been a historical lack of appreciation for micronutrients in ketogenic diets, leading to deficiencies like selenium deficiency, which has been linked to cardiomyopathy and even death in case reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Appropriate supplementation or careful diet formulation is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

### Contraindications and Monitoring
Certain inborn errors of metabolism, such as carnitine transferase deficiency, are absolute contraindications for a ketogenic diet and can be deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

Monitoring biomarkers is important:
*   **Blood glucose and ketones:** The glucose ketone index (glucose over ketones in millimolar concentration) can be used to assess the metabolic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:42">[02:28:42]</a>. A glucose ketone index of one, sustained for 24 hours, is believed to induce and maximize autophagy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:17">[02:29:17]</a>.
*   **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs):** Provide insightful information on dietary adherence and glycemic response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:39">[02:32:39]</a>. A flat glucose trace indicates good adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:46">[02:32:46]</a>.
*   **Breath Acetone:** Correlates well with fat oxidation and can indicate fat loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:48">[02:29:48]</a>. It is also easier to measure than blood ketone levels for frequent monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:38">[02:30:38]</a>.

## [[therapeutic_benefits_of_ketone_supplementation | Ketone Supplementation]] / [[benefits_of_exogenous_ketones | Exogenous Ketones]]
Exogenous ketones provide a way to achieve ketosis without strict dietary adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. They can elevate bioidentical ketone bodies in blood and tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. Different formulations exist:
*   **Ketone Esters:** Can cause a rapid, large spike in beta-hydroxybutyrate, which may lead to an insulin release (if too high a dose) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a> and a drop in blood glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>. High doses can also lead to metabolic acidosis and a pH drop above 3 millimolar ketone levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.
*   **Ketone Salts:** Beta-hydroxybutyrate bound to electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. When combined with MCTs, they cause a slower, more sustained elevation of ketones, which is preferable to avoid an insulin spike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>.
*   **MCT Oils/Powders:** Can raise ketone levels on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a> and extend the sustainment of ketosis when combined with ketone esters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.

Exogenous ketones are seen as calorie-containing molecules similar to creatine, which can elevate ketone bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. They are a "nascent literature" but expanding rapidly, with dozens of clinical trials underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.

## Role in Chronic Diseases

### [[ketones_and_neurological_disorders | Neurological Disorders]]
The ketogenic diet is the only widely accepted application in epilepsy and metabolic disorders like glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 deficiency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:57">[02:19:57]</a>. It has also shown promise in:
*   **Seizures:** Higher ketone levels are therapeutically linked to treating seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Both classical and modified ketogenic diets have anti-seizure effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Exogenous ketones have remarkable anti-seizure effects in animal models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. The anti-seizure effect is partly due to increased GABAergic tone in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.
*   **Angelman Syndrome:** Case reports show seizures can be silenced with a ketogenic diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. Ketone ester administration in animal models increased GAD65 and GAD67 (enzymes involved in GABA synthesis), leading to increased GABA and improved learning, memory, and anti-anxiety effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
*   **Alzheimer's Disease:** While not universally effective, the ketogenic diet works remarkably well for some patients, particularly those with a "metabolic phenotype" where FDG PET scans show glucose hypometabolism in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:11">[01:48:11]</a>. Ketones act as an alternative energy substrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a>. MCTs (e.g., from coconut oil) and ketone esters have been observed to acutely stop tremors and improve animation in patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's-like symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:32">[01:50:32]</a>.
*   **Parkinson's Disease:** While not a cure, there's anecdotal evidence that ketone supplements can noticeably stop essential tremors and somewhat orthostatic tremors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:15">[01:55:15]</a>.
*   **Migraines:** Ketogenic diets and ketone supplements can help manage chronic migraines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:52">[01:56:52]</a>. This is likely due to multi-modal mechanisms, including increased GABAergic tone, increased brain blood flow (via adenosine, a powerful vasodilator), and anti-inflammatory effects that mitigate neuroinflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:10">[01:57:10]</a>.

### Cancer
*   **Metabolic Stress:** The ketogenic diet, especially if calorie-restricted, puts metabolic stress on cancer cells, stimulates cancer cell death, and makes tumors more sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. It also protects normal, healthy cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:26">[02:04:26]</a>.
*   **Immune System Enhancement:** The ketogenic diet can augment the immune system, making it "hyper-vigilant" to detect and attack cancer cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:41">[02:02:41]</a>. This enhancement makes chemotherapy and radiation work better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:21">[02:05:21]</a>. For example, PD-L1 inhibitors were greatly augmented in the context of a ketogenic diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:54">[02:05:54]</a>.
*   **Tumor Metabolism:** Most aggressive cancer cells rely on fermentable fuels like glucose and glutamine due to defective mitochondria and hypoxia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:03">[02:15:03]</a>. They cannot use ketones as an energy source because it's a mitochondrial process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:56">[02:15:56]</a>. Ketones can decrease proliferation by reducing the activity of glycolytic enzymes like hexokinase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>.
*   **Specific Cancers:** Brain tumors, aggressive solid tumors, endometrial cancers, and certain GI and lung cancers associated with metabolic derangement or high glycolytic activity are likely responsive to ketogenic diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:04">[02:13:04]</a>. Gliomas, in particular, seem to be responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:45">[02:06:45]</a>.
*   **Prevention:** Animal research has shown a reduction in spontaneous tumors in rodents on cyclical ketogenic diets, suggesting a possible preventative mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:51">[02:16:51]</a>.

### Metabolic Disorders
*   **Type 2 Diabetes:** Ketogenic diets and exogenous ketones are considered potentially optimal for managing type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:18">[01:47:18]</a>. In non-diabetic individuals who are overweight, a gradual transition to a ketogenic diet improved metabolic parameters and glycemic variability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>.
*   **Weight Loss:** Ketones have a satiating effect on the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:23">[01:47:23]</a>, making it easier to adhere to a calorie deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:06">[01:48:06]</a>. When ketones are elevated, the brain, even with low glucose, does not signal a need to eat, preserving energy metabolism and preventing feelings of hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:29">[01:47:29]</a>.

### Sarcopenia and Muscle Wasting
*   **Anti-catabolic effects:** Ketones prevent muscle loss during fasting or periods of limited food availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:38]</a>. They provide alternative energy to the brain, reducing the need to liberate gluconeogenic amino acids from skeletal muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. This is crucial in contexts like weight loss diets or intermittent fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>.
*   **Skeletal Muscle Regeneration:** Acetoacetate, specifically, has shown effects in muscular dystrophy regarding increasing skeletal muscle regeneration through an ERK-MEK cyclin D mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.
*   **Cachexia:** Ketones are of interest for preventing age-related sarcopenia and skeletal muscle wasting associated with cancer cachexia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>. They act through anti-inflammatory pathways to mitigate inflammation-induced muscle wasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.

### Autoimmune Disease
Preliminary evidence suggests that ketogenic diets and fasting-mimicking diets may help with autoimmune diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:48">[02:00:48]</a>. [[ketones_and_neurological_disorders | Ketosis]] might reduce intestinal permeability and suppress inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF alpha) that contribute to autoimmune conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:14">[02:02:14]</a>.

## [[ketogenic_diets_impact_on_aging_and_healthspan | Impact on Aging and Healthspan]]
Animal model studies suggest that cyclical ketogenic diets can improve healthspan, with older mice showing better cognition than younger mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:26">[01:32:26]</a>. The combination of dietary restriction (time-restricted feeding) and a ketogenic diet appears to be particularly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:34">[01:38:34]</a>. This may be due to the body's adaptive response to food scarcity, which historically enhanced cognition and performance in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>.

## General Considerations for Ketogenic Diets
*   **Calorie Counting:** Despite common beliefs in the ketogenic community, calories absolutely matter for weight management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:26">[02:42:26]</a>. Ketogenic foods are calorically dense, so tracking calories is crucial, especially initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Chronic vs. Cyclical Ketosis:** Chronic ketosis is likely not ideal or natural for most people unless managing a responsive chronic disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>. Intermittent fasting or cyclical approaches may provide more benefits for healthy individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>.
*   **Metabolic Flexibility:** Training in a semi-fasted state (low glucose, low insulin) can induce metabolic adaptations that allow the body to optimally use multiple fuel sources (glucose, fatty acids, ketone bodies, lactate) during exercise or daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>.
*   **Carnivore Diet:** While a form of ketogenic diet and beneficial for some, its long-term sustainability and optimal benefits are not scientifically supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:30">[02:20:30]</a>. The lack of fiber and phytonutrients, and potential negative biomarker changes (e.g., elevated LDL and triglycerides), raise concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:07">[02:19:07]</a>.

[[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a molecule that has become increasingly relevant to the field of [[role_of_nad_in_aging | aging]] in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is considered one of the most important molecules on the planet, with life ceasing to exist without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Its related precursor molecules, [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Riboside]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Mononucleotide]], are often referred to as [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] and are available as consumer supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Role of NAD

[[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] plays a critical role in various biological processes essential for life and health:
*   **Energy Metabolism** [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | NAD]] has a very important role in [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | energy metabolism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It participates in reduction and oxidation (redox) reactions, which are crucial for the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids and the formation of ATP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Cells need to maintain massive concentrations of both [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] and NADH for these reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Cofactor for Enzymes** [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] acts as a cofactor, meaning it is required for many important enzymes to function, including those inside the mitochondria that participate in [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | energy generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **DNA Repair** [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | NAD]] is vital for mitigating [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | DNA damage]] as it is a cofactor for PARP1, a crucial enzyme involved in [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | DNA repair]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Excessive [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | DNA damage]] and PARP1 activation can significantly decrease [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Higher PARP1 activity has been correlated with longer maximum lifespan in mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Sirtuin Activation** [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] is required to activate sirtuins, a family of enzymes involved in longevity and regulating metabolic processes, response to stress, and lifespan modulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Sirtuins use [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] for epigenetic regulation, controlling the activation of genes involved in [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | energy metabolism]], DNA repair, and cell survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## NAD Decline with Age

[[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] decrease with [[effects_of_nad_decline_with_age | age]] across multiple tissues, including the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart, which have high metabolic demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This [[effects_of_nad_decline_with_age | decrease in NAD levels]] is associated with many hallmarks of [[role_of_nad_in_aging | aging]], such as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>:
*   Loss of proteostasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   Mitochondrial dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Cellular senescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Altered epigenetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Increased [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | DNA damage]] and reactive oxygen species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>

When [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] decline, tissues like the brain, immune cells, and muscle tissue may not function properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This [[effects_of_nad_decline_with_age | NAD depletion]] may predispose organisms to various [[role_of_nad_in_aging | age]]-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), cardiovascular disease, muscle atrophy, and increased susceptibility to infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

The complete reason for [[effects_of_nad_decline_with_age | NAD decline with age]] is still an open question, but factors include increased chronic inflammation and immune activation (which consume [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]]) and a decreased ability to produce and recycle [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Boosting NAD Levels

### Lifestyle and Diet
[[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] are heavily influenced by lifestyle factors that cause energy stress, such as exercise, fasting, or caloric restriction, all of which raise [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

[[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] can be synthesized from dietary sources like the amino acid tryptophan (found in salmon, spinach, nuts) and the three forms of niacin (vitamin B3), including nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Riboside]] (found in lean meats, legumes, vegetables) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. However, dietary sources are not the major source of [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] because the body's demand for [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] is too high to meet through diet alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The primary source is through a recycling mechanism called the [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### NAD Precursors as Supplements
[[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Riboside]] (NR) and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Mononucleotide]] (NMN) are referred to as [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] because, in supplement form, they have been shown to be well tolerated at high doses and to effectively raise [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

#### Preclinical (Animal) Data
High doses of [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] in animal studies have shown promising [[effects_of_nad_boosters_and_their_impact_on_aging | effects of NAD boosters]] on [[role_of_nad_in_aging | aging]] and various tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
*   **[[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Riboside]] (NR)**:
    *   Counteracted an obesogenic diet by improving insulin sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
    *   Improved endurance and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
    *   Reversed mitochondrial damage and increased mitochondrial biogenesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
    *   Reversed muscular atrophy in animals with severe muscle wasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
    *   Increased neurogenesis, decreased cognitive deterioration and amyloid-beta production, and increased synaptic plasticity in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **[[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Mononucleotide]] (NMN)**:
    *   Counteracted an obesogenic diet and improved metabolic health markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
    *   Improved heart function in animals with heart problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
    *   Improved cognition and memory in animals with neurodegenerative disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
    *   Long-term dietary administration mitigated [[effects_of_nad_decline_with_age | age]]-associated physiological decline in mice, leading to improved skeletal muscle function, mitochondrial function, increased energy expenditure, increased bone density, and decreased insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. These benefits were dose-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

#### Potential Risks and Concerns
> [!WARNING] Cancer Context
> In a recent animal study, [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Mononucleotide]] (NMN) was shown to accelerate cancer growth in mice with a specific type of pancreatic cancer where pro-inflammatory senescent cells drive tumor growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Injected high-dose NMN led to significant increases in precancerous and cancerous lesions in the pancreas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This effect was dependent on senescent cells, which can disrupt normal tissue functions and ironically drive cancer progression over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] seems to increase the tumorigenic quality of senescent cells, likely due to its role in [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | energy metabolism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. While this study focused on NMN, it is possible [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Riboside]] (NR) may show similar results in this specific cancer context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This does not mean these supplements cause cancer, but long-term animal studies are needed to confirm safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

#### Translation to Humans: Challenges
Several factors make translating animal study data to humans challenging:
*   **Dose Discrepancies**: Most rodent studies used very high doses of [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] (e.g., 400 mg/kg body weight orally) or [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NMN]] (e.g., 500 mg/kg body weight, often injected) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The human equivalent doses are much higher than doses typically tested in human clinical trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. For a 180-pound person, 400 mg/kg NR translates to approximately 2.6 grams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. For NMN, a high beneficial oral dose of 300 mg/kg translates to approximately 2 grams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   **Bioavailability**: It is unclear if [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] or [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NMN]] can reach other tissues intact and directly form [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] without first being metabolized into nicotinamide via the salvage pathway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
    *   Low oral doses in animals (50 mg/kg) produced very low levels of directly formed [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] only in the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
    *   A higher oral dose of NR (200 mg/kg) showed no direct [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] formation in tissues other than the liver, though more salvage pathway-derived [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] was found in the kidney, muscle, and brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
    *   Intravenous administration at varying doses did produce direct [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] in the liver, kidney, and muscle, but only salvage pathway [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] was detected in the brain, suggesting [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NMN]] do not directly cross the blood-brain barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.
*   **Direct [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] Supplementation**: Oral administration of direct [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] is primarily digested into nicotinamide, [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]], and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NMN]] before absorption, indicating poor bioavailability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. While IV infusion may bypass digestion, no mammalian [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] transporter has been identified, and extracellular [[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] has not been shown to be taken up into tissues other than the brain and heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

#### Human Clinical Data
Currently, there is no published evidence of oral [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Mononucleotide]] supplementation in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. However, two randomized placebo-controlled trials have shown that oral [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Riboside]] (NR) can increase [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] in white blood cells in a dose-dependent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>:
*   An eight-week study with 120 healthy adults (ages 60-80) found that 250 mg daily of [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] and pterostilbene increased whole blood [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] by 40% after four weeks, and 500 mg daily increased levels by 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. The lower dose also showed reduced diastolic blood pressure and lower liver enzyme levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.
*   Another trial with 60 middle-aged and older adults (ages 55-79) demonstrated that 500 mg of [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] twice daily (1 gram total) for six weeks was well-tolerated and increased [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] in white blood cells by 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. Improvements in blood pressure and aortic stiffness were observed but were not statistically significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NR]] had no effects on metabolic function, motor function, or exercise capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

The highest dose tested in human clinical studies was one gram per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>, which is significantly lower than the human equivalent doses that showed benefits in animal studies (e.g., 2.6 grams per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

#### Supplement Stability
[[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Riboside]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Mononucleotide]] can break down into nicotinamide over time, especially in conditions of high humidity or heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. This is notable because supplemental nicotinamide may reduce sirtuin activation, which is generally undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. Keeping these supplements cold helps maintain stability and minimize nicotinamide content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[role_of_nad_in_aging | NAD]] is crucial for survival, with its [[effects_of_nad_decline_with_age | levels declining with age]] due to normal living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. This decline contributes to metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction and increased [[nads_involvement_in_energy_metabolism_and_dna_repair | DNA damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. While lifestyle interventions like exercise and fasting can increase [[nad_levels_and_their_impact_on_aging_and_metabolism | NAD levels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>, [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] such as [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Riboside]] and [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | Nicotinamide Mononucleotide]] show promise, primarily from animal studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

However, many questions remain regarding the long-term effectiveness and safety of these [[nicotinamide_riboside_and_nicotinamide_mononucleotide_as_nad_boosters | NAD boosters]] in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. The preclinical data is promising, but caution is advised until more robust human clinical trials are conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.

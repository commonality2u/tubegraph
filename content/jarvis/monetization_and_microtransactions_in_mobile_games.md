[[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]], a popular mobile game, serves as a prominent example of how monetization and microtransactions are implemented in the mobile gaming industry. The game has achieved significant financial success, becoming the top-grossing mobile game in the UK and Germany and ranking among the top five in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:26">[08:00:26]</a>.

## Core Monetization Mechanics
At its core, [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]]'s gameplay revolves around a slot machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:48">[08:40:48]</a>, where players spin to earn loot, attack, or raid fellow "Vikings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:03">[08:49:03]</a>. The primary goal is to build up a village, which involves repeatedly buying the next available item in a linear progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:33">[09:51:33]</a>.

The game offers limited free plays, typically five spins per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:54">[10:27:54]</a>. Once these spins are exhausted, players have two options to continue playing:
1.  **Purchase more spins** with real money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:02">[10:31:02]</a>. For example, a player could pay $4.99 every five minutes to continue playing indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:07">[10:39:07]</a>.
2.  **Directly buy in-game coins** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:35">[10:53:35]</a>. Players can purchase 65 million coins for $400, which is presented as the "best offer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:39">[10:58:39]</a>.

The game's design ensures that players frequently encounter situations where they are one step away from completing a level or repairing damage, prompting them to spend money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:14">[12:53:14]</a>.

## Strategies to Encourage Spending
[[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]] employs several strategies to encourage player spending:

*   **Initial "Winning" Experience:** New players often experience frequent wins, receiving extra spins and shields to protect their villages, creating an early sense of luck and accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:44">[11:12:44]</a>. This initial positive reinforcement can be seen as an [[ad_targeting_for_mobile_games | ad targeting]] strategy.
*   **Gifts and Freebies:** Players who connect their Facebook accounts may receive substantial gifts, such as 50 free spins and a million coins, to re-engage them with the slot machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
*   **Constant Microtransaction Offers:** Every time a player runs out of spins, they are presented with a microtransaction offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:04">[12:46:04]</a>.
*   **Progress Reset Through Raids:** Player villages are frequently raided, costing money to repair the damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:13">[13:28:13]</a>. This effectively takes away progress, compelling players to spend more to regain their footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:13">[13:39:13]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Notifications:** The game constantly sends notifications and gifts to keep players engaged and on the "hook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:09">[18:26:09]</a>. These notifications include alerts about village damage, special updates, and reminders of free spins and coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:09">[18:31:09]</a>.
*   **Introduction of New Features:** To maintain engagement, the game periodically adds new features, like a "brand new wheel" for free stuff or a Tamagotchi-like pet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:43">[19:52:43]</a>, seemingly to offer "other addicting games" within the main app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:04">[20:10:04]</a>.

## Ethical Concerns and Criticism
The implementation of monetization in [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]] raises significant [[ethical_concerns_with_mobile_gaming_and_gambling | ethical concerns with mobile gaming and gambling]]:

*   **Simulated Gambling:** Despite its cartoonish art style and kid-friendly feel, the App Store describes the game's mechanics as "frequent / intense simulated gambling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>. The game is essentially a slot machine with flash animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:07">[20:42:07]</a>.
*   **Engineered for Addiction:** The game appears "scientifically engineered to cause a gambling addiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:03">[20:44:03]</a>.
*   **Exploitation of Vulnerable Players:** There are concerns that the game might identify players prone to gambling addictions or high spending and then manipulate their gameplay experience, making them lose more often or get raided more frequently, to encourage further spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:44">[13:59:44]</a>.
*   **Lack of Transparency:** The game's terms and conditions include a class action waiver and arbitration clause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:07">[09:07:07]</a>. Furthermore, the "multiplayer" aspect is questionable; attacks from other players ("raids") could be automated processes using fake accounts with stock photos and uncommon names, making it impossible to verify if real players are responsible for taking away progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:43">[14:29:43]</a>. This means players have no way of knowing if the game is acting in good faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:09">[14:23:09]</a>.
*   **No Real Gameplay:** Critics argue that [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]] is "not a game" because it lacks challenge, skill, or meaningful choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:08">[17:09:08]</a>. It offers "very little game happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:04">[21:55:04]</a>, instead boiling down to "its raw most money-making qualities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:00]</a>.
*   **Investor Background:** One of [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]]'s top investors is Gigi Levi Weiss, the CEO of an online casino company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:08">[21:03:08]</a>, raising questions about potential vested interests in building harmful gambling habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:08">[21:13:08]</a>.

While microtransactions are not inherently bad and can be a sustainable way for game developers to monetize their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:10">[21:35:10]</a>, the soulless and exploitative nature of [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]]'s monetization model is a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:13">[22:28:13]</a>.

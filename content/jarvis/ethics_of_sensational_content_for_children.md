Morgz is a YouTuber with over 11 million subscribers, known for content such as 24-hour challenges, pranks, and life hacks, often involving his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. His primary audience is children, a fact highlighted by "MorgzFest," an event where adults over 18 had to be accompanied by a child to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The nature of his content, particularly its sensational elements, raises significant ethical concerns given its young demographic.

## Morgz's Content and Its Child Audience

Morgz's mother, Morgz Mum, also creates "family-friendly content" that includes pranks, such as one where she pretended to have been attacked and lost her memory, which the narrator described as "psychological abuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. While Morgz's earlier content was seen as merely "obnoxious," his more recent videos are deemed "more problematic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### The "Best Scare Prank on Family!" Video

One particularly concerning video is titled "THE BEST SCARE PRANK ON FAMILY!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The thumbnail itself was described as "horrifying," depicting Morgz "not alive" in a bathtub filled with what appears to be "his own body fluid," specifically red liquid resembling blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. YouTube age-restricted this video, which theoretically prevents Morgz's young audience from viewing it unless they lie about their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

The prank involves Morgz trashing his house to simulate a break-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Throughout the video, Morgz repeatedly instructs viewers to "watch till the end," a tactic that the narrator notes manipulates young viewers who "don't have any agency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The "break-in" is depicted with cartoonish humor clearly aimed at children, including exaggerated screaming and chaotic actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

However, the tone drastically shifts with the final part of the prank: Morgz simulates his own gruesome death by filling a bathroom with fake blood, making it appear that "something bad has happened" to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### Impact on Viewers and Ethical Concerns

When Morgz's mother discovers him in this state, her screams indicate genuine distress over what appears to be her son's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. The narrator highlights the [[ethics_of_blending_fiction_and_reality_on_social_media | blending between cartoon and reality]] in the video, making the gruesome simulated death potentially "triggering" and emotionally distressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. The father's reaction even involves attempting to "drown" Morgz as a response to the prank, a display of unreasonable violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

A significant ethical concern raised is the psychological [[impact_of_sensationalist_content_on_children | impact of misleading content on children]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. At one point, Morgz tells his audience to "subscribe to the channel if [they] don't want someone to break into [their] house," without any qualification or "just kidding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This directly manipulates children through fear for their family's safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

The narrator expresses strong [[criticism_of_sensationalist_content_on_youtube | criticism of sensationalist content on YouTube]], particularly regarding the [[the_issue_of_inappropriate_childrens_content_on_youtube | inappropriateness]] of such dark themes for a young audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Despite elements of the video having "genuinely funny content" and "slapstick humor," the choice to escalate to a simulated gruesome death is viewed as an unnecessary and harmful turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. The video also lacks a clear "don't try this at home" warning within the content itself, which is crucial for an "impressionable audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

It's just a little, I mean, it's kind of a lot upsetting to me because they, I mean they were so close to not... if you just cut out all the scenes with... and it's actually like a cute video with some slapstick humor, some fun times. Why'd you have to take it there bad? Why did it have to get so dark?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>

[[Overview of The Bachelor | The Bachelor]] is widely regarded as a "bad tv show," even by its audience, which often expects it to be bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, the show can still disappoint its viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This season, in particular, was not enjoyable for the commentator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The show's fundamental problem is its production, which consistently results in a poor viewing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

## Show Premise and Format
[[Overview of The Bachelor | The Bachelor]] is described as a "marriage game show" where participants are "woefully unprepared for marriage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Each season typically begins with quirky introductions of its contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, followed by the bachelor dating around 30 women simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The women arrive one by one, often performing strange acts suggested by producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Casting and Departures from Tradition
The franchise has made some notable casting choices, including:
*   **Clare Crawley**: Initially cast as the first "senior citizen" [[Analysis of The Bachelorette and its contestants | Bachelorette]] at 39 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Her season "went sideways" when she quickly fell in love with Dale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, leading to her early departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Tayshia Adams**: Stepped in to pick up the pieces of the heartbroken cast after Clare's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. She is considered "perfect" and capable of anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Matt James**: Announced as the first Black Bachelor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This casting broke the traditional formula where the Bachelor/Bachelorette is usually a former contestant from a previous season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Matt was an "outsider," having only been close to being on Clare's season but not actually appearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. His qualifications for the role were questioned, with the only notable aspect being his friendship with a popular [[Analysis of The Bachelorette and its contestants | Bachelorette]] contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Critique of Show's Approach to Dating and Drama
The show is heavily criticized for its emphasis on [[Role of producers and editing in The Bachelor | petty drama]] over genuine character development and romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Lack of Emotional Connection**: Producers prioritize drama over connecting emotionally with contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Villain Archetypes**: The show frequently introduces an obvious "villain" or "plant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, such as "Queen Victoria" who is introduced being carried by "subjects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Misuse of "Toxic"**: The term "toxic" is frequently used by contestants to describe behavior they dislike, demonstrating a lack of nuanced language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Exploitation of Personal Struggles**: Contestants dealing with difficult personal situations, such as Sarah, who was a caretaker for her father with ALS, are often "painted as needy and selfish" and ganged up on by other contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Her departure from the show, due to inability to contact her family and the rules, was celebrated by other contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The only person who extended empathy to Sarah became popular enough to be the next [[Analysis of The Bachelorette and its contestants | Bachelorette]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Spreading Baseless Rumors**: A significant drama involved Anna baselessly claiming a new girl, Brittany, was an "escort" based on DMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This ruined Brittany's online presence, with "escort" appearing in search results for her name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The show is criticized for not cutting such harmful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, and Matt James's acceptance of the "Chicago is a small town" defense is mocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Matt James's Performance**: Matt James is described as "inert" and "robotic" in his interactions with contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. He often responds to declarations of love with "thank you for sharing that with me," which is seen as impersonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Exploitation of Family Dynamics**: The show brought Matt's estranged father on for a 10-minute segment to "clear the air," which is deemed a "bad idea" and "super uncomfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## Racial Issues and Controversies
[[Racial issues and controversies within The Bachelor | Racial issues and controversies within The Bachelor]] played a major role in the critique of this season.
*   **Rachael Kirkconnell Controversy**: Rumors and photos emerged of frontrunner Rachael Kirkconnell attending an "antebellum-themed sorority party" in Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Celebrating a period defined by slavery is considered a "bad look" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Chris Harrison's Defense**: Chris Harrison, the show's host, attempted to defend Rachael's behavior in an interview with Rachel Lindsay, the first Black [[Analysis of The Bachelorette and its contestants | Bachelorette]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Harrison questioned if it was a "good look in 2018 or is it not a good look in 2021," implying a difference in societal standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This defense was met with criticism for implying racism was acceptable in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> and for using the "everybody was doing it" defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Online Harassment**: Following this interview, Rachel Lindsay was "harassed off of Instagram" for calmly explaining why Harrison's logic was flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Matt James also had to delete his Instagram posts due to harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. The optics of the Black individuals deactivating accounts while the controversy raged highlight the severity of the harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Producer Knowledge**: Questions were raised about whether producers knew about Rachael Kirkconnell's questionable past before casting her, suggesting it might have been done for ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **Matt's Decision**: Matt James ultimately broke up with Rachael because they were "coming from different life experiences" and he didn't want to be the one to "teach her what it's like to be black in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Aftershow's Tone**: The aftershow, hosted by Emmanuel Acho (replacing Chris Harrison), delved into "uncomfortable conversations with a black man" about the pressures of being the first Black Bachelor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. However, the show's sudden "extreme tone shift" from discussing serious racial issues to announcing the next [[Analysis of The Bachelorette and its contestants | Bachelorette]] during a commercial break was seen as jarring and inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

## Overall Critique
The show's production is consistently poor, and the overall experience of watching the season was negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. The commentator states this will likely be the last time discussing [[Overview of The Bachelor | The Bachelor]] because "the messing with people's lives for entertainment has gone too far" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. There are "other ways to make television interesting," and [[Overview of The Bachelor | The Bachelor]] is not it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. Producers need to take responsibility for the impact of their actions and how they present people on the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

## Characteristics of a "Two Turnt" Influencer

[[Analysis of social media influencer behavior | Analysis of social media influencer behavior]] reveals several key behaviors associated with being "too turnt":

*   **Aggressive Online Engagement**: Tony is known for his hostile replies to even innocuous tweets that mention him, especially those implying his ducks are "props" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. He searches his own name to find mentions, even on private accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   **Controversial Animal Interactions**:
    *   **"Pets" vs. "Props"**: Tony fiercely maintains that his ducks are "pets," not "props," despite content that suggests otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This raises questions about [[the_dynamics_and_implications_of_using_animals_as_social_media_props | the dynamics and implications of using animals as social media props]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.
    *   **Implied Relationships**: His videos suggest a complex, sometimes inappropriate, relationship with his animals, including scenarios of jealousy and sexualized interactions (e.g., a duck saying "yes daddy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Animal Welfare Concerns**: Questions are raised about the safety and well-being of the animals, such as ducks potentially ingesting "eggplant pills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a> or chickens being left at sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a>.
*   **Unconventional Lifestyle Portrayal**:
    *   **Eccentric Habits**: Tony's content depicts him as addicted to "eggplant emoji pills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a> and only able to drink through a beer bong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
    *   **Nudity and Public Incidents**: He appears to be naked in public settings, such as grocery stores, leading to confrontations with staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.
*   **Family as Content**: Tony incorporates his family members, including his mother and sister, into his content, often in pranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>. His mother is depicted as very vulgar and frequently upset by his filming and masked guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>.
*   **Objectification of Humans**: Similar to his animals, humans are sometimes used as props, such as a "model friend" wearing a ski mask and serving as a table for a chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>.

## The "Turnt" Scale: A Cautionary Tale

The discussion frames Tony's behavior as a demonstration of "too turnt," suggesting what to avoid when seeking to "get turnt" (i.e., have fun) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Examples of "two-tertedness" include:

*   The aggressive social media replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   Preferring the company of ducks over people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
*   The necessity of drinking only through a beer bong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
*   The potentially harmful and sexualized use of animals in content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

Conversely, a [[analysis_of_tiktok_influencer_strategies | TikTok]] of Tony simply enjoying time with his "happy duck family" is deemed "not two-turned" and "an acceptable amount of turn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>. The ultimate judgment on "being too turnt" is to avoid behaviors similar to Tony's, opting for normal social interactions and boundaries instead of animal sexualization or questionable public antics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:10]</a>.

## Monetization and [[The Role of Influencer Marketing | Influencer Marketing]]

Tony's "living for a living" status is further supported by his sale of "pre-worn crop tops" on Depop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. This indicates that his controversial online persona and content, including his animal-centric videos, contribute to his livelihood through [[the_role_of_influencer_marketing | influencer marketing]] and merchandise sales.

[[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] have evolved significantly since their early days, transforming from simple, personality-based questionnaires to increasingly bizarre and specific challenges.

## Early Encounters and Purpose
For many, the first encounter with [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] was approximately ten years prior to the video's recording, appearing in Facebook feeds alongside other popular online activities like Farmville or social photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:10">[02:17:10]</a>. These quizzes served as a break from daily online routines, offering users insights into aspects of themselves, such as their attractiveness or their "inner pirate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>.

On the [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed]] website, quizzes are conveniently located next to the news section, implying their equal importance to the site's content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed]] generally deals in [[influence_of_viral_content_and_clickbait | trending topics]], leading to content that can swing from horrific news to "so cute" observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Quizzes also aimed to reveal self-knowledge, such as one's mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, future number of children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, or even an "inner Lacroix flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Quiz Style
Originally, [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] were described as "very pointless" but "straightforward," like a "What's Harry Potter character are you?" type quiz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. More recently, they have become "really weird and specific" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Many now ask users to complete a task before revealing information they might already know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. An example given is "Shop at Victoria's Secret and we'll give you an Ariana Grande song to listen to," which is considered an unfair trade due to the effort involved versus the reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

Another characteristic of modern [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] is their tendency to "challenge your intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, for example, betting that a user hasn't tried half the cheeses on a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Some quizzes also claim "frightening accuracy" in guessing personal details like age based on preferences for a movie night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. The titles themselves can sometimes reflect a lack of confidence in the quiz's ability, such as "It'll be a miracle if we can guess your age based on your dessert preferences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

## Notable Quizzes
One particularly unusual quiz encountered is "This yes or no quiz will tell us if you love poo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. This quiz, written by [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed]] staff, asks a series of personal and somewhat absurd questions related to bowel movements, using stock photos of people in distress on toilets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. The quiz includes questions about feeling happy after a bowel movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>, looking back at one's stool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>, feeling lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>, texting or sending selfies while on the toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>, announcing bathroom breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>, discussing pooping with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>, having a daily regimen or "poop journal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>, and owning poop-themed items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. The existence of stock photos for such specific scenarios, like a man smiling while defecating and taking a selfie, highlights the bizarre nature of content sometimes sought for these quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:10]</a>.

## Business and Cultural Context
A waiter character in a comedic sketch suggests that "quiz callers" (a metaphor for quiz creators) work for free, implying a low-cost or volunteer-driven model for some [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed]] content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. It is humorously suggested that one "Gabe," a bored college student, is responsible for some quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. While the video was unable to delve deeply into the substance, it briefly mentions past [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed]] layoffs of writing staff and an anecdote about half of their quiz traffic coming from one college student in a previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

Despite their oddity, the creation of these quizzes by [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed]] staff is suggested to be done in good fun, possibly as an "inside joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>, contributing to the [[humor_in_buzzfeed_quizzes | humor in BuzzFeed quizzes]] and [[the_appeal_and_criticism_of_buzzfeed_quizzes | appeal of BuzzFeed quizzes]].

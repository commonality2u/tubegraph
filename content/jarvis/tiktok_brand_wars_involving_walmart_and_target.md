The internet is a peculiar place, and the phenomenon of brands acting like people on social media has previously created a "strange dystopia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. While previously focused on "brand twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a> and companies like Wendy's or Burger King, the trend resurfaced with a new development: a "war" between two billion-dollar department store corporations, Target and Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:21">[01:24:21]</a>. This conflict, primarily unfolding on [[tiktok_community_dynamics_and_meme_culture | TikTok]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>, began over shopping carts and escalated to include threats, bullying, theft, and corporate espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a>.

## Genesis of the Conflict

The "war" originated from a lone Target employee who found a Walmart shopping cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>. Instead of ignoring it, the employee created a fictional narrative, declaring the cart a "hostage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:01">[03:36:01]</a>.

> "Hello, this is a message to Walmart from Target. We are currently holding one of your shopping carts hostage. You have 24 hours to respond or else." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>

The "or else" threat comically involved pushing a Target shopping cart into the Walmart cart as a "threatening gesture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:26">[03:51:26]</a>. This initial video went viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:21">[04:25:21]</a>, leading to a follow-up [[commentary_on_tiktok_trends | TikTok]] where the employee continued the narrative, stating the cart was "kept guarded behind bars" and "screams for help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:54">[04:27:54]</a>.

## Corporate Engagement

Due to the virality, Walmart's marketing team saw an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:44">[05:08:44]</a>. They responded with their own [[commentary_on_tiktok_trends | TikTok]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:43">[05:29:43]</a>, featuring a "target ball with a walmart jacket on it and a name tag that says surge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:09">[05:40:09]</a>. Target, in turn, had to respond, presenting a "war general ball" that could "assemble the avengers of target's corporate partners" like Starbucks, Ulta, Disney, and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:35">[06:39:35]</a>. The official Target account posted a video, prompting other brands like Pizza Hut Express to comment, wanting to be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:03">[07:34:03]</a>. Some [[analysis_of_tiktok_influencer_strategies | TikTok]] accounts even replied as if Target were "a small up-and-coming tick tock creator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:02">[08:15:02]</a>.

## Employee-Led Escalation

Individual employees also played a significant role in escalating the conflict.

*   **Colton (colton runs 2003):** Identified as a leader "in command of the walmart empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, Colton made several [[tiktok_pranks_and_trends | TikToks]] corralling an "army of shopping carts like he's a war general slash the night king" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:37">[09:37:37]</a>. He personally stole a cart from Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:07">[11:26:07]</a> and asked viewers to "choose a side, are you red or are you blue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.
*   **Jaden (Original Target Employee):** After Walmart "rescued" its cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:04">[09:47:04]</a>, Jaden responded with a "cinematic" video, initially appearing unaware of the cart's escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. Later, in response to Colton's theft, Jaden insinuated the stolen Walmart cart was a "double agent" or "Trojan horse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:06">[12:26:06]</a>, claiming it escaped with "hundreds of company secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:20">[12:41:20]</a>. These videos also depicted carts moving autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

### Key Battles and Incidents

*   **Cart Brutalization:** A "gruesome" clip showed Walmart employees "brutalizing a poor target card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:42">[13:23:42]</a>. This was seen as a "call to arms" for Target employees nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:05">[14:03:05]</a>, who fictionally armed themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:12">[14:08:12]</a>.
*   **Neutral Nations Drawn In:** Home Depot, usually neutral in such situations, took Walmart's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:47">[14:48:47]</a>. Amazon also appeared, stationed outside a Walmart, though Walmart warned them to stay out of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:19">[15:24:19]</a>.
*   **The Cold War Era:** Tensions eventually cooled, entering a "cold war era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:42">[16:22:42]</a>. Colton continued to provoke Target, affectionately calling it "Targy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:03">[16:44:03]</a>.
*   **Crossover with [[tiktok_pranks_and_trends | Devious Licks]]:** The conflict even crossed over with the [[tiktok_pranks_and_trends | Devious Licks]] trend, which involved stealing items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:19">[16:54:19]</a>.

## Crossover to Brand Twitter

The "feud" also extended to Twitter, with official accounts engaging in dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:01">[18:06:01]</a>. Target tweeted, "because we're not walmart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:32">[18:16:32]</a>, to which Walmart responded with a Mariah Carey "why you so obsessed with me" meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:35">[18:19:35]</a>. This indicated a return to "brand twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:39">[18:25:39]</a>.

## Nature and Implications

The "war" is seen as a "marketable internet moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:39">[01:16:05]</a> that appears to have started with random employees rather than a planned corporate scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:03">[01:17:18]</a>. The companies capitalized on already viral [[tiktok_community_dynamics_and_meme_culture | TikToks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[01:27:00]</a>, providing "free advertising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. While the corporations profit from the attention, the employees gain "[[tiktok_community_dynamics_and_meme_culture | TikTok]] clout" and potentially followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, though it is uncertain if they are compensated for their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The phenomenon is viewed as "mostly harmless" as long as the public remembers that the corporations are "profiting off of our attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

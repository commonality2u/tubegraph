*America's Most Smartest Model*, a single-season reality television series aired on VH1, posed the question: "Can pretty go thinky thinky, can hot hot sexy model also have brain?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The show's premise aimed to combine the worlds of modeling and intelligence, akin to *America's Next Top Model* meets *Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. However, it quickly devolved into a platform for shaming and the perpetuation of [[Cultural stereotypes in media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Critiques on Show Format and Stereotypes

The show's challenges, designed to merge beauty with trivia, often failed to genuinely test intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Examples included a spelling bee featuring obscure foreign fashion brands or a runway walk requiring contestants to list types of trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Instead of assessing intellect, these segments frequently resulted in [[Negative portrayal of models and contestants in reality television]] through [[Discussion on body shaming and intelligence shaming in media|intelligence shaming]] and [[Discussion on body shaming and intelligence shaming in media|body shaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The overall tone was described as "very shameful" and "based on being mean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

A core criticism of the show's format is its reliance on [[Cultural stereotypes in media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This was particularly evident in the hosts' portrayal. Mary Alice Stevenson represented the beauty aspect, while Ben Stein, a former economist and speechwriter for Richard Nixon, personified the "brains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Stein's role on the show reinforced the "stereotype of being smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, often by being condescending and using obscure words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Body Shaming and Intelligence Shaming

The show actively engaged in [[Discussion on body shaming and intelligence shaming in media|body shaming]]. Judges delivered harsh critiques, telling one male contestant, "I think you might need to lose some weight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> and instructing him to "slim down a bit" and "tone up that center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This reinforces "unrealistic beauty standards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

[[Discussion on body shaming and intelligence shaming in media|Intelligence shaming]] was also rampant. The judges often used difficult words or American-centric trivia, disadvantaging non-native English speakers or international contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. For example, an Argentinian contestant was made to spell "nincompoop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, a word the show later confirmed was given specifically to mock him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. The fact that the show locked essential amenities like bathrooms and the refrigerator behind trivia questions highlights the show's disregard for contestants' basic needs, framed as a "human rights violation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a> and a "lie" because it's unlikely they were truly denied access to food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## Toxic Dynamics and Negative Portrayal of Contestants

The show fostered [[Discussion on toxic dynamics and bullying in reality TV]], with little to no camaraderie among contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Instead, everyone was "at each other's neck at all times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Contestants engaged in cattiness, making derogatory remarks about each other's appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

The show deliberately created [[Negative portrayal of models and contestants in reality television]] through editing and casting:
*   **Mandy Lynn**: A former Playboy and lingerie model, Mandy Lynn was constantly "porn star" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, which, while not inherently bad, was used to "chop her down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Her runway walk was criticized as "too sexy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, with one judge asking, "Mandy Lynn walks like she's having sex all the time, what does this mean?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Gaston**: An Argentinian model, Gaston was heavily edited to appear as a "slimy little troll" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> who made "inappropriate sexual comments towards every woman in the house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. While his actions were inappropriate, the show's producers intentionally cast him and continued to air these clips for "funny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a> effect, rather than eliminating him quietly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. This highlights the producers' influence on the contestants' narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Contestant with ADHD**: A contestant with ADHD was "always edit[ed] as like being off the walls and like unable to to stop talking and just like completely unaware of his surroundings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This portrayal was criticized as "a dumb stereotype" and "a little ableist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Andre**: Introduced as a "bad boy" from the "Soviet Union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, Andre boasted about his expensive lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a> and overconfidence, only to perform terribly in challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

## The Role of Hosts and Production

The hosts, particularly Ben Stein, contributed to the show's problematic nature. Stein engaged in "creepy old guy bit[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, constantly "fawning over the female contestants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> and making inappropriate comments, such as asking Mandy Lynn why she didn't list "nipples" as something round during her runway challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. His actions were characterized as "gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

The show's production seemed to intentionally break down contestants' self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The early elimination of two contestants, mere minutes into the first episode, without a clear reason, served to demonstrate the hosts' power and cruelty, described as "demons that feed off of breaking the spirit of these young hopeful models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

Overall, *America's Most Smartest Model* is indicative of early 2000s reality television, where producers "could just say anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. The show prioritized being mean and overusing stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> over genuinely exploring its stated premise.

*The Bachelorette*, described as a "marriage game show" where contestants aim to win someone's hand in marriage by simultaneously dating 30 people, provides a compelling example of how [[reality_tv_show_editing_and_narrative | reality TV show editing and narrative]] and [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | producer influence]] shape audience perception and storyline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The show's format, which allocates approximately 48 minutes per person per day to fall in love, raises questions about the authenticity of relationships formed under such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Exaggerated Narratives and Stereotypes

The series frequently employs exaggerated narratives to create drama and engage viewers.

### Age and Casting Portrayal
When Claire Crawley was announced as "the world's oldest Bachelorette" at 39, the show's portrayal made her seem significantly older, often implying she was "106" or "on death's door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Initial casting for Claire's season drew criticism for featuring predominantly young men, prompting ABC to replace some "stud muffins" with "slightly older ones" in response to public outcry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### COVID-19 as a Plot Device
The global COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the entire production to relocate to a single resort, was heavily dramatized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Contestants' quarantines and testing processes were presented as an "over dramatized plot point," despite being a common experience for the viewing public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Scenes of Claire isolating were shown in time-lapse, making it appear as if she was confined and suffering, even though she was at a resort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The constant mention of being "clear" from the virus was noted for its resemblance to a "drug commercial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## [[reality_tv_show_editing_and_narrative | Editing and Scripting]] Techniques

The show extensively uses [[reality_tv_show_editing_and_narrative | editing]] to craft narratives and create specific impressions, leading to a [[critique_of_video_scripting_and_storytelling | critique of video scripting and storytelling]].

### Manipulated Dialogue
Dialogue is often "obviously edited," with individual words seemingly "taken from a different place," demonstrating how producers "can make you say anything on this show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This technique can misrepresent a person's intentions or create manufactured drama.

### Staged Storylines and Misleading Previews
Key plot points, such as Claire's early departure and the introduction of a second Bachelorette, appeared to be decided upon due to contracts and then "staged" for "coverage for the storyline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Previews frequently use out-of-context lines, like Chris Harrison's "congratulations, you've just blown up the Bachelorette," which make little sense when finally seen in their actual context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

Similarly, a scene implying a contestant "walkout" in protest of Dale receiving all of Claire's attention was revealed to be misleading, as Dale himself was present in the clip, suggesting they were "just going to lunch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Character Portrayal Through Editing

The [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | editing]] process significantly shapes how contestants are perceived.

### Dale: The Enigmatic Lead
Dale, Claire's chosen partner, is presented as physically attractive but lacking substance, often speaking in "canned phrases" like an "NPC" (Non-Player Character) or "hallmark card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Despite Claire's immediate certainty that she had met her husband upon seeing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, the show fails to "show" his "greatness," opting instead to "tell" the audience, leading to questions about the basis of their connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### Other Contestants: Stereotypes and Villains
Many contestants are reduced to single character traits, such as Ivan who "likes chess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, or the "Harvard" alum whose education is his sole defining characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

Yosef, a medical device salesman, is portrayed as the season's villain, characterized by his unsolicited opinions, condescending behavior, and "classless" comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. His outrage over a dodgeball date, despite not participating, and his age-shaming Claire further cement his negative image, demonstrating how [[reality_tv_show_editing_and_narrative | editing]] can construct a clear antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

## [[critique_of_reality_tv_and_its_portrayal_of_relationships | Critique of Show Format and Ethics]]

The heavy reliance on [[reality_tv_show_editing_and_narrative | dramatization and editing]] leads to a [[critique_of_reality_tv_and_its_portrayal_of_relationships | critique of reality TV and its portrayal of relationships]] and raises ethical questions about the show's structure and the treatment of its participants.

### Manufactured Outcomes
Claire's season was clearly orchestrated for her to end up with Dale, as evident from the first episode which showed her "in a hundred different ways that she's leaving with Dale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This predetermined outcome undermines the show's premise of finding love, turning the viewing experience into watching "how it happens" rather than "what happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Producer Influence and Contestant Reactions
Producers are depicted as actively shaping events, such as when they decided to "wrap this [sh*t] up" and "get Tasha in here stat" after Claire's overt favoritism towards Dale became too disruptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. The host, Chris Harrison, is shown pressuring Dale to propose, highlighting the contractual obligations and producer-driven nature of the "spontaneous" moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

Contestants are left feeling exploited, as exemplified by Kenny's demand for an apology from Claire for "faking it" and falling in love with Dale so quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This highlights a tension between the "game show" aspect and the genuine emotions of participants. The show's "smoking mirrors" approach suggests that little on screen is entirely authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

Disney Plus launched at midnight on November 12, 2019, bringing with it a wave of nostalgia through old movies that were once available on Netflix [00:00:31]. The streaming service is anticipated to be successful due to Disney's vast ownership of various properties [00:00:56]. Alongside its extensive back catalog, Disney Plus also announced new original series, including a Star Wars spin-off about Boba Fett and a Lizzie McGuire reboot featuring a millennial Hilary Duff navigating adulthood [00:02:04].

## High School Musical Reboot

Of particular interest was the announcement of a High School Musical reboot, distinct from the approach in *High School Musical 3* which attempted to introduce new characters to replace the original cast [00:02:18]. This new series, titled *High School Musical: The Musical: The Series* (HSM TM TS) [00:03:10], is a mockumentary that takes place at the actual high school in Salt Lake City, Utah, where the original *High School Musical* movie was filmed [00:02:40].

In the show's universe, the original *High School Musical* is a movie [00:02:48]. The premise revolves around the fact that the high school where the movie was shot had never actually staged a production of *High School Musical: The Musical* [00:02:53]. The series follows a group of theater kids as they put on a showing of *High School Musical*, creating a meta-narrative [00:03:01].

The series is released episode by episode rather than all at once [00:04:01]. The speaker, a self-proclaimed long-time fan of High School Musical, having made an early YouTube video dancing to it, was excited for its release [00:03:32].

> It's challenging to watch *High School Musical: The Musical: The Series* without having seen the original *High School Musical*, as the entire premise of the show is built around it and references it frequently [00:04:33]. The show is very self-aware in its use of the source material [00:12:13].

## Characters

The show features a cast of actual, talented teenagers [00:04:53].

*   **Ricky:** An 18-year-old skater boy who dislikes musicals [00:05:18]. He is positioned as the "Troy" character, destined to play the lead despite his initial reluctance, joining the musical to win back the girl [00:05:27]. He is also frequently late, much like Troy in the original film [00:16:06]. Ricky has never seen *High School Musical* himself [00:04:45].
*   **Nini:** The "Gabriella" of the cast, she is the quintessential theater kid who has never had a leading role, often playing background characters like a tree or the back of a cow [00:05:55].
*   **Big Red (Toby from The Office):** Ricky's best friend [00:06:19].
*   **EJ Caswell:** Described as Nini's new boyfriend [00:13:37], he is co-captain of the water polo team and senior class treasurer [00:13:52]. He is supportive of Nini [00:13:39].
*   **Gina:** An "old theater pro" who recently transferred to East High specifically to be in the musical [00:06:53]. She is considered the "Sharpay" of the group [00:07:02].
*   **Miss Jenn:** The new drama teacher at East High [00:11:33]. She is a millennial actress who claims to have been a background dancer in the original *High School Musical* movie within the show's universe [00:11:47].
*   **Carlos:** The show's choreographer [00:12:17], he has seen the first *High School Musical* movie 37 times but has not seen the sequels [00:12:20].

## First Episode Analysis

The story opens with the new drama teacher, Miss Jenn, watching the *High School Musical* movie in the school parking lot [00:07:21]. This scene immediately establishes the show's meta-narrative [00:07:50]. The beginning of the show features moments that feel like a shot-for-shot retelling of the original movie's opening, such as characters skating to class at the same location where the basketball boys awaited Troy's return [00:07:55].

The episode introduces a relationship issue between Ricky and Nini, who were dating but took a break over the summer at Ricky's suggestion [00:09:06]. Nini, who attended theater camp, now has a new boyfriend, EJ Caswell [00:09:12]. Ricky's proposal for a "pause" in their relationship was due to his fear of commitment, specifically after Nini expressed her love for him in a public Instagram post six weeks prior [00:09:18].

An assembly is called to introduce the new theater teacher, Miss Jenn [00:11:17]. She announces that the school will be staging a production of *High School Musical*, which has never been done before [00:11:19]. The auditions begin, and Ricky, driven by jealousy of EJ, decides to audition for the musical despite his dislike for them, hoping to get close to Nini [00:14:26]. Ricky, who has never seen the original *High School Musical*, attempts to watch it in class [00:14:48].

During auditions, everyone is "suspiciously talented" [00:15:38]. Nini performs an incredible audition [00:15:44]. Ricky then bursts into the auditorium late, mirroring Troy's characteristic tardiness in the original movie [00:15:52]. Ricky auditions by singing Nini's song from her Instagram post, rather than a song from *High School Musical* [00:16:53].

Ultimately, the cast list is posted, and Ricky and Nini are cast as Troy and Gabriella, respectively [00:17:34].

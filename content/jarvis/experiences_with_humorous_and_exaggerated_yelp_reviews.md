From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Jarvis, a content creator, explores the phenomenon of exaggerated and often nonsensical one-star Yelp reviews, driven by a personal disdain for the platform despite having previously worked there as a software engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. He expresses bewilderment at the level of [[discussion_on_the_misguided_overentitlement_in_yelp_reviews | self-importance]] required to "blab on about anything they want" expecting an audience's attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

The video begins with a humorous skit where Jarvis, playing a character named Jarvis, encounters a "Bird-of-Paradise" flower that accidentally puts pollen in his nose. His response is an immediate, exaggerated condemnation, concluding with "one star" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This skit serves as a satirical introduction to the main topic, highlighting the absurdity of trivial complaints leading to harsh reviews.

## The One-Star Review Phenomenon

For a business to receive a one-star review, the reviewer must either intensely "hate the business" or believe that the business's actions were "so bad that they deserve whatever consequences" come from the review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. However, Jarvis notes that this is "almost never the case" because people frequently complain about "the most random [things]" that have "nothing to do with the business itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

One-star reviews often fall into two categories:
*   Conspiracy theories where "the business is out to get them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   Exaggerated complaints from "really entitled" customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Examples of Exaggerated One-Star Reviews

### Phil's Coffee: The Tipping Conspiracy

Jarvis shares a one-star review for Phil's Coffee, a place he frequents daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. The review alleges a "conspiracy theory" where customers who don't tip receive bad coffee due to a secret jargon or gestures used by cashiers and baristas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Jarvis refutes this, pointing out that customers don't even pay until *after* coffee making begins, making the theory illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### National Parks: Nature's Shortcomings

The sense of [[discussion_on_the_misguided_overentitlement_in_yelp_reviews | entitlement]] is particularly evident in reviews for national parks, which Jarvis finds to be a rich source of [[humor_around_misunderstandings_and_misconceptions_in_yelp_reviews | misunderstandings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

#### Grand Canyon National Park

Despite being "home to much of the immense Grand Canyon with its layered bands of Red Rock revealing millions of years of geological history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, it receives one-star reviews for bizarre reasons:

*   **Jor BP's Take:**
    > "Grand Canyon you're a giant hole in the ground you were caused by erosion you don't have roller coasters or dippin dots jeez" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>

*   **Barry G's Unimpressed View:**
    > "Oh I've seen better big whoop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>
    Jarvis questions what Barry G gained from such a review and points out that Barry G also gave a four-star review to a "gym in San Francisco that... sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

*   **Yellowstone Comparison:**
    > "Once you've been to Yellowstone the Grand Canyon is a joke and I'm an Arizona native there are no animals no greenery no clear blue streams just a muddy river rock and sheer cliffs so it's not another place it's like this place isn't like the place I other place I like I've been to Yellowstone twice with buffalo herds walking near my car an entire elk herd passing me when I went hiking Bald Eagles so big I thought it was Jurassic Park bears bears twice and even a wolf trying to steal a baby buffalo and the standoff along I heard and at the Grand Canyon a hole a very large hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>
    Jarvis satirizes this by saying, "Okay we get it the Grand Canyon sucks the bald eagles are small you obviously bears once and there are no wolves trying to steal Buffalo babies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

#### Yellowstone National Park

Described as a "nearly 3500 square mile wilderness Recreation Area atop of volcanic hotspot" with "dramatic canyons alpine rivers lush forests hot springs and gushing geysers" and "hundreds of animal species including bears wolves bison elk and antelope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>, Yellowstone also faces harsh criticism:

*   **Hating Nature (This Specific Nature):**
    > "I know what I am writing is committing a sacrilege sack our village I know what I am writing here is committing a SCARA llege but I hated Yellowstone the problem with the place is that it is dull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>
    Jarvis summarizes, "this is not some nature hating guy he just hates this nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

*   **Traffic, Parking, and Grass:**
    > "very scenic however the most beautiful sights of our time however absolutely breathtaking and however absolutely breathtaking and one-of-a-kind beauty however traffic is terrible and the roads are not in good shape the sights to see like geysers have little tiny parking lots... spent a whole day in park and only saw some bison saw moose deer etc outside a park what $30 and you have grass inside of your park" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>
    Jarvis sarcastically retorts, "Well guess what buster I have grass at my house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

*   **Wi-Fi and Food Complaints:**
    > "another issue is the lack of cell phone service... there is little to absolutely no service Wi-Fi is available in select areas of the park and for 24 hours of this slow service you have to pay $12... The hot lunch is at my school are better and that in itself is just sad for who I have refused to eat several times on this trip due a lack of variety and taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>
    Jarvis points out that lack of cell towers might be "by design" in a National Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a> and that $12 for Wi-Fi isn't expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. He then mimics a reviewer's exaggerated "hunger strike" in protest of the meal variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

#### Glacier National Park

Reviews for Glacier National Park in Montana were deemed by Jarvis as having the "most buck wild attendees writing reviews" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

*   **Speed Limit Confusion and Snow in June:**
    > "warning to all first-time visitors to Glacier National Park in 2016... if you were driving into the park warned your family and friends speed traveler the speed limit between Apgar village and Lake McDonald Lodge is 40 not gonna tell you any units or anything but it's 40 say your car to 40 and you'll be just fine I seriously thought the speed limit was 45... also at the time of our visit half of the road was closed due to snow... well there is no snow on the mountains and it being way June it could not possibly have snowed there was there a UFO" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>
    Jarvis satirizes the reviewer's leap to "UFOs" for normal mountain conditions in June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

*   **The "Worst Review Ever": Joseph's Complaints**
    This review for Two Medicine Campground in East Glacier is highlighted as the "worst review that I have ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

    > "There were the most number of Rangers who exerted the most control I've ever experienced at any camping trip there was problem one Ranger for every three campers... there were an extreme number of rules which the large geriatric community helped the Rangers viciously enforce... my daughter was told she couldn't take a rock from next to the lake there were many many rules on where we could go where our dog could go etcetera... The park rangers reminded me of the TSA at airports serious power trip there was extreme control of nature and bears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>
    Jarvis interprets this as the reviewer being "mad that the Rangers were doing their job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a> and "roasting old people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. He emphasizes that it's a "national park, it's protected ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a> and jokes that Joseph probably wants to "fight a bear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.

    > "we were followed and inspected any time we ate at the picnic table yeah cuz you seem like a pretty high risk camper my guy we couldn't enjoy a picnic because we we couldn't enjoy a picnic because we knew the Rangers were patrolling to make sure we took all our food with us when we left you can't enjoy a picnic unless you're allowed to litter afterward you know who likes leftover food that's just lying around bears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>
    Jarvis points out the obvious safety reason for rangers enforcing food disposal rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.

    > "needless to say we saw no animals other than birds and one mountain goat at Logan Pass the goat had a huge tracking collar placed by the forest tree very artificial is he saying the experience was artificial because if we go to had a tracking collar on it or does he think this is an animatronic goat I'm pretty sure they put trackers on on all the animals you know to like keep track of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>
    He questions if the reviewer thinks the tracking collar made the experience "artificial" or if he thought it was an animatronic goat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>.

    The reviewer concludes by stating, "glacier has postcard views of landscape but that's all it offers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>, and contradictorily, "me being from Montana I would drive there again for a day or so" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>, despite giving it a one-star review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. This highlights the [[humor_around_misunderstandings_and_misconceptions_in_yelp_reviews | contradictory nature]] and [[discussion_on_the_misguided_overentitlement_in_yelp_reviews | misguided perspectives]] often found in these reviews.

The 2006 Disney Channel original movie *High School Musical* is described as the story of Zac Efron's "glow-up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, and also the story of high school basketball star Troy Bolton and "freaky genius girl" Gabriella Montez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The film explores their journey of balancing existing identities with a new and growing love for musical theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Troy Bolton

Troy Bolton is introduced as a high school basketball star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, the leader of the basketball boys at East High School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. His "family" is the basketball team, headed by his actual father, the coach, who is comically referred to as "Basketball Dad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. His relationship with his father primarily revolves around basketball, often seen practicing the same move: "fake right and then break left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Troy faces a core conflict between his love for basketball and a burgeoning interest in singing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. He wishes to keep his singing "on the low" because the support from his basketball teammates is conditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. His father is seen as a major cause of this conflict due to his "weird beef with Darbus," the drama teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Troy attempts to open up to his father about trying something new but is met with basketball-centric responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Gabriella Montez

Gabriella Montez is introduced as a "freaky genius girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Her "family" within the school cliques is the "smart clique" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. She is depicted as exceptionally intelligent, capable of correcting her teacher in chemistry/calculus class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Her intelligence and beauty are presented as a "real struggle for her character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Gabriella is often nervous on her first day at a new school and expresses a desire not to be known as the "freaky genius girl again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. She is pressured by her mother to engage in activities beyond reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. She is recruited by Taylor, head of the "judgmental science geeks," to join the Scholastic Decathlon, a club that has never advanced past the first round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

## Shared Journey and Relationship

Troy and Gabriella first meet at a ski lodge's New Year's Eve "young adults party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. They are reluctantly bullied into singing karaoke by an "omniscient Oracle Slash DJ" MC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Despite initial hesitation, they quickly perform "The Start of Something New" in "perfect harmonies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

Coincidentally, Gabriella is transferred to East High School, Troy's school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. They discover they are "drift compatible" by completing each other's sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Their interest in auditioning for the school musical leads to them getting a callback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Jarvis addresses [[comparison_with_other_similar_youtube_channels | Seven Second Riddles]] in the context of other popular YouTube channels, particularly those from the same creator or with similar content strategies. He notes that the content of [[comparison_with_other_similar_youtube_channels | Seven Second Riddles]] is "bad," but for reasons that are not immediately obvious [00:00:43].

## Five-Minute Crafts

[[comparison_with_other_similar_youtube_channels | Seven Second Riddles]] is created by the same team behind [[criticism_of_lowquality_content_on_youtube_channels | Five-Minute Crafts]] [00:00:05]. Jarvis indicates he has previously discussed [[criticism_of_lowquality_content_on_youtube_channels | Five-Minute Crafts]] extensively [00:00:19].

## Bright Side

The riddles presented on [[comparison_with_other_similar_youtube_channels | Seven Second Riddles]] are very similar to those found on [[critique_of_bright_side_youtube_channel | Bright Side]] [00:04:33]. A key difference highlighted is that [[critique_of_bright_side_youtube_channel | Bright Side]] riddles typically include a voice-over, whereas [[comparison_with_other_similar_youtube_channels | Seven Second Riddles]] does not [00:04:30].

## Facts Verse

Jarvis groups [[comparison_with_other_similar_youtube_channels | Facts Verse]] and [[critique_of_bright_side_youtube_channel | Bright Side]] together when discussing a common problem shared with [[comparison_with_other_similar_youtube_channels | Seven Second Riddles]] [00:12:52].

## Shared Criticisms of Content Strategy

The primary issue Jarvis identifies with [[comparison_with_other_similar_youtube_channels | Seven Second Riddles]] and similar channels like [[critique_of_bright_side_youtube_channel | Bright Side]] and [[comparison_with_other_similar_youtube_channels | Facts Verse]] is their "hyper-sensationalist" content [00:12:54].

Jarvis argues that this content strategy is harmful to young people due to psychological phenomena:
*   **Availability Heuristic** The channels create the impression that certain events are more likely because viewers are presented with many examples of them [00:13:06]. For instance, viewers might fear plane crashes more than car crashes due to news coverage, even though driving is statistically less safe than flying [00:13:14].
*   **Negativity Bias** Humans are naturally more drawn to unpleasant things [00:13:28].
*   **[[youtube_algorithm_and_channel_content_strategy | YouTube Algorithm]]** When combined with these biases, the [[youtube_algorithm_and_channel_content_strategy | YouTube algorithm]] can "work people's sense of reality" and make them feel that "the world is way bleaker than it actually is" [00:13:40].

The use of cartoons in these channels is noted as particularly concerning because it makes the content more appealing to a younger audience [00:13:48]. Building entire channels around themes of "murder and bad things happening" is viewed as exploitative [00:14:18]. While acknowledging that most people are naturally afraid of bad things happening, Jarvis reassures that the world is not as full of "murder or lying or riddles as this channel may make it seem" [00:14:36].

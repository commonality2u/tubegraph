From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Online content creators, often self-proclaimed "alpha males," frequently offer advice on understanding and interacting with women, which can sometimes perpetuate [[gender_stereotypes_in_online_content | gender stereotypes]] and [[misogyny_in_modern_podcasting | misogynistic]] views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This advice is often presented as fact, despite potential harm and a lack of empirical basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Zay Double Edge's Relationship "Game"

One such content creator, Zay Double Edge, shares his worldview, which he also promotes in his book, "Stop Getting Left on Red: Get Nudes Instead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. His approach to relationships is framed as a "game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Initial Stages of Dating

Zay advises men not to take women seriously in the beginning stages of a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. He suggests that "real women" should almost "beat you up" before being taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Viewing dating as a "game" is meant to make it fun, and not doing so can lead to hating women and giving off hateful energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Women's "Manipulation Strategies"

According to Zay, women employ a "top manipulation strategy" to get into men's heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. If a woman posts indirect pictures online showing she's "moving on" or with another guy (e.g., empty wine glasses, date settings) without actually showing him, it's a test to see "how weak you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. A "strong dude" will not react by calling or "blowing up her phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. If a woman is truly done with a man, she won't try to manipulate him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Views on American Women and Men

Zay asserts that American women are "hard to deal with" and "arrogant" because the average American guy is "programmed to be a simp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. He believes that if a man "stands on principles" and "says whatever the [heck] he wants," this is what defines a "real man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. He also claims that "toxic masculinity" is a concept that "real men don't let women tell them what a real man is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Emotionality and "Programmability" of Women

Zay describes women as "emotional beings" who feel emotions deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. He claims that a heartbreak for a woman hurts as much as "grieving over somebody's death" and that women "break like glass" and "never really fully recover" after two to three heartbreaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

He also states that a woman's past matters because women are "programmable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. If men in her past "programmed her that she should not be treated that way," she "can't appreciate" being treated like a queen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

Zay further suggests that God gave women a "unique ability" to be in tune with the "emotional and spiritual world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### Measuring a Woman's Attraction Level

Zay outlines two ways to measure a woman's attraction level:
1.  **Compliance**: How compliant she is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. He claims that once a woman starts to say "yes" and comply, her "feminine nature will make her like you because she doesn't have free will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

## Core Masculinity Principles

Zay teaches "deep rooted core masculinity principles" that he believes fathers or brothers should have taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

*   **Never Ask for a Favor with an Empty Hand**: He criticizes followers who ask for more free advice, calling it "beta male [expletive]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. He claims this indicates a man was "raised in a feminine ass household" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Never Tolerate Disrespect**: Men should "rather be put six feet under than to be disrespected," as this is something a "female can't teach you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Always Be Alert**: Men should never walk around with their heads down, but always be alert and know what's going on, as those who avoid eye contact are "easiest ones to get robbed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Don't Express Emotions**: A man should never express his feelings if a woman is "begging you to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. He states that a woman who needs a man to express emotions "like a beta male simp mangina" is insecure and powerless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This aligns with [[mens_insecurity_and_controlling_behavior_in_relationships | men's insecurity and controlling behavior in relationships]].

## The "Microwave Age" and Men's Victimhood

Zay claims that many men are depressed, sad, and unsuccessful because they have "became a victim of the microwave age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. He believes this makes them "scared to take risks," "scared to take a leap of faith," and "scared of what other people think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. He states that a man "cannot feel like a man or even feel happiness until you thrive in discomfort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker, after reviewing Zay's content, concludes that becoming an "alpha male" as defined by Zay is too difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. He notes that women do not even like such men, who are constantly denying their emotions, worrying about being robbed, and are expected to "die" on their principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The speaker instead advocates for being oneself and not feeling the need to change, stating that "you're doing just fine and you get to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. He also advises against manipulating people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

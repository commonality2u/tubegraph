## Shake's Post-Show Conduct and Perceptions

[[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]], a contestant from Love is Blind Season 2, became the central figure of the [[love_is_blind_season_2_reunion | reunion]] due to his continued controversial actions and statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. His performance during the [[love_is_blind_season_2_reunion | reunion]] elicited strong [[reactions_and_dynamics_during_the_love_is_blind_reunion | responses]], including guttural yelps from viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Pre-Reunion Context
By the time of the [[love_is_blind_season_2_reunion | reunion]], months had passed since the show aired, leading the cast to be aware of [[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]]'s "true colors" and allegedly more offensive comments that were not included in the final edit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This context meant the cast had a significant amount of disdain for him from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Behavior at the Reunion
[[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]] immediately expressed concern about how he would be edited, which was seen as a "self-report" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. His actions included:
*   **Victim Mode**: He quickly adopted a victim mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Interruption and Meddling**: He consistently interrupted other cast members, including Shane (who himself "sucks"), to offer his unsolicited opinions on their relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Misinterpretation of Show Format**: He argued that the [[the_concept_and_criticism_of_love_is_blind_as_a_dating_show | show]] is about "finding love" rather than finding a wife, despite the clear premise of marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. He also incorrectly stated the [[the_concept_and_criticism_of_love_is_blind_as_a_dating_show | show]] isn't about skipping steps in a relationship, which is its literal premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Physical Attraction Focus**: During the segment discussing his relationship with Deepti, he reiterated his focus on physical attraction, comparing marriage to a "huge purchase" requiring a "certain physical body type" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. He even stated that a "big weight discrepancy" would be difficult for him to overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.
*   **Insulting the Host**: In a shocking moment, when confronted by host Vanessa Lachey about his physical preferences, [[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]] stated the "only person I'm attracted to in this room is Vanessa Lachey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

### Post-Reunion Online Presence
After the [[love_is_blind_season_2_reunion | reunion]], [[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]]'s Instagram became a "dumpster fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

He even reposted content from a meme account that is speculated to be run by himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

## Deepti's Empowerment and New Developments

Deepti, who chose not to marry [[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]] at the end of the season, stood firm in her decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Her rejection of [[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]] was celebrated, with her stating, "I deserve somebody who knows for sure so I'm choosing myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

During the [[love_is_blind_season_2_reunion | reunion]], Deepti maintained a dignified presence, often seen laughing at [[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]]'s comments, which was seen as cathartic by viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. She directly confronted [[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]], emphasizing that while it's acceptable not to be physically attracted to someone, his manner of expressing it was "extremely disrespectful" and "degrading to women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

The [[love_is_blind_season_2_reunion | reunion]] featured an unprecedented moment where hosts Nick and Vanessa Lachey directly berated a contestant, [[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Vanessa Lachey specifically challenged [[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]] on why he participated in the [[the_concept_and_criticism_of_love_is_blind_as_a_dating_show | Love is Blind show]] if physical attraction was so paramount to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. This deviation from the typical host role was seen as a "best thing," as Vanessa "breaks frame" and "goes in on [[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]] like she has also had enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Even Nick Lachey engaged in roasting [[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]], suggesting that [[character_analysis_of_shake_from_love_is_blind | Shake]] "feeds off of being insulted" given his [[reactions_and_dynamics_during_the_love_is_blind_reunion | reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

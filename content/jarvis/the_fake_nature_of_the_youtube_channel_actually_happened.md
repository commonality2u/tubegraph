From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The YouTube channel [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] presents itself as a digital platform where individuals can submit their personal stories to be animated and shared globally, with the sole criterion being that the stories "must be true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:45">[01:37:45]</a>. However, an investigation revealed that the channel's content is largely fabricated or plagiarized, functioning as a deceptive venture by a major content production company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>.

## Affiliation with TheSoul Publishing

[[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] is identified as another channel created by the same entity responsible for "5-Minute Crafts" and "Bright Side," collectively known as TheSoul Publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>. TheSoul Publishing is known for its strategy of prioritizing content quantity over quality and has been accused of plagiarizing other creators, a practice that continues with [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

## Deceptive Practices

[[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] mimics the self-description of legitimate channels like "Storybooth," which genuinely features stories submitted and narrated by children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:15">[01:49:15]</a>. In contrast, [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] operates without a genuine submission platform or a dedicated website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:51">[02:17:51]</a>. The only purported way to submit stories is via an email address (`welcome@brightside.me`), which is the same email used across all of TheSoul Publishing's channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>.

The channel's stories are characterized as vague, generic, demonstrably false, or stolen from the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:41">[02:32:41]</a>.

### Examples of Fabricated or Plagiarized Stories

#### "I broke up with my girlfriend because of potatoes"

This story, featuring a character named Andy, is presented as a true account of a man who humorously pretended not to know what potatoes were during a dinner with his girlfriend's parents, leading to their breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:48">[02:40:48]</a>. This "oddly specific story" was found to be nearly identical to a post on the "Today I F***ed Up" subreddit from three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:27">[06:05:27]</a>.

#### "I became a criminal but was suddenly caught"

This narrative follows Fred, a "good boy" who escalates from parkour to shoplifting with friends, eventually getting caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:01">[06:26:01]</a>. The story is vague and generic, hiding behind the anonymity of the supposed narrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:32">[08:16:32]</a>.

#### "I rebelled at school bands but it went too far"

This story details a school prank involving students bringing "potentially threatening items" like bananas and water bottles, which were confiscated, leading to a viral social media campaign that supposedly gained national attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:35">[09:47:35]</a>. There is no public record of such an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:05">[09:07:05]</a>, and the story was also found on Reddit, where many stories are known to be fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:28">[10:49:28]</a>. The previous class's alleged prank of building a swimming pool inside the library is also unverified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:19">[08:54:19]</a>.

#### "My mom woke up from a coma and it's terrifying"

This video features a 13-year-old girl named Alice sharing a deeply personal and tragic story about her mother waking from a coma with severe brain damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. The channel frequently uses "dramatic elements like divorce, mental breakdowns, depression, and disease" as [[criticism_of_sensationalist_content_on_youtube | clickbait]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. The highly emotional content of this particular story is deemed a "fake story" designed to be [[impact_of_fake_stories_on_youtube | emotionally manipulative]] for views and comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:38">[12:14:38]</a>.

## Concrete Evidence of Falsity

An email received by a Reddit user from TheSoul Publishing, intended for a scriptwriter job inquiry, confirmed the channel's fabricated nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:40">[14:02:40]</a>. The email, from "hello@add.me.ru" (which redirects to TheSoul Publishing's Russian website), detailed the requirements for a scriptwriter position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:47">[14:41:47]</a>.

The job description for scriptwriters openly stated:
*   Scriptwriters are "fully responsible for the quality of stories told by our characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:56">[15:39:56]</a>.
*   The channel "offers real-life stories told by American teenagers aged up to 16" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>.
*   A key requirement is "believability," meaning stories "ought to sound like they're told by a real teenager and be as close to real life as possible without creating a sense that they're fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:32">[15:58:32]</a>.
*   Scriptwriters are encouraged to "use as references the stories of real people that they shared on various social media platforms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:49">[16:21:49]</a>, but the "script should be a real story with the beginning, the development events and an outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:09">[16:28:09]</a>.
*   Scripts must be written in "lively colloquial English," with the expectation that "the American viewer should feel that your central characters are native English speakers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:59">[16:35:59]</a>. However, applicants also needed to be fluent in Russian to submit scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:04">[17:47:04]</a>.

Google Drive links provided in the email led to finished [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] videos, with file ownership tracing back to "thesoulpublishing.net" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:43">[17:11:43]</a>. Further investigation found Russian LinkedIn profiles confirming individuals working for TheSoul Publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:28">[17:21:28]</a>.

## Impact and [[Criticism of fake animated stories on YouTube | Criticism]]

[[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] is a prime example of the [[proliferation_of_fake_animated_story_channels_on_youtube | proliferation of fake animated story channels on YouTube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. This deliberate misrepresentation means that viewers are "emotionally manipulated by this fake story" and expend emotional energy on fabricated narratives, which only serve to boost engagement metrics for the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:10">[13:19:10]</a>.

The channel's presence on YouTube's trending page, reaching as high as number three, raises concerns about the platform's role in promoting dishonest content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>. The argument is made that YouTube should be more rigorous in its promotion decisions, especially given its broad influence, similar to how individual creators are held accountable for their endorsements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:50">[18:22:50]</a>.

The [[impact_of_fake_stories_on_youtube | consequences of blurring the lines between real life and drama]] are significant, as evidenced by the case of "Lonelygirl15," a popular vlogger who lost audience engagement once it was revealed she was an actress filmed in a studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:06">[18:56:06]</a>. When drama is falsely presented as reality, it has negative repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:17">[19:18:17]</a>.

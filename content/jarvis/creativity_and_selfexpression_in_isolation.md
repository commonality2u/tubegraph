From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

During a period of staying indoors due to a pandemic, the creator, experiencing boredom, sought out ways to be productive and explore new activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34"></a>. This led to an attempt to complete "100 things to do while stuck inside" from an online article, aiming to quickly find a new hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40"></a>. Many of these activities served as avenues for [[exploring_new_hobbies_at_home | creativity and self-expression]].

## Exploring Activities and Hobbies

The challenge involved spending approximately two minutes on each activity from the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02"></a>. Initial attempts included:

*   Starting a blog or journal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22"></a>. The creator chose the blog name "Sizzling Pizza Prince" and shared a post expressing feelings of being "misunderstood" and "so popular wildfire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40"></a>.
*   Learning a new instrument, specifically a new keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22"></a>.
*   Writing poetry, such as a haiku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55"></a>.

*   Practicing meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34"></a>.
*   Learning to braid hair via YouTube tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51"></a>.

Further activities from the list included:
*   Engaging in a ten-step skincare routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38"></a>.
*   Creating a charcuterie board with limited available groceries, including organic apple juice squeezies, cheddar cheeses, Takis, Ritz crackers, Goldfish crackers, and gummy bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04"></a>.
*   Learning calligraphy and writing physical letters to friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02"></a>.
*   Reading the rules to complex board games like Catan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16"></a>.
*   Attempting a self-portrait with pencil and paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14"></a>.
*   Taking a bubble bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29"></a> and making classic cocktails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31"></a>.
*   Reflecting on past accomplishments and setting goals for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40"></a>.
*   Starting a short story or novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50"></a>.
*   Learning new recipes, even experimenting with unusual ingredient combinations like Heinz baked beans and gummy bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21"></a>.
*   Exploring old English words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49"></a>.

## Reflections on Productivity and Purpose in Isolation

Despite completing many of the suggested tasks, the creator noted that most felt like chores rather than hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06"></a>. Although some activities, like starting a blog and learning piano and Japanese, were found to be easier than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10"></a>, no definitive "next big thing" or new hobby was discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46"></a>.

The creator observed that there is significant pressure from the internet to utilize isolation as an opportunity to become the "best versions of ourselves" and avoid wasting time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45"></a>. However, the creator concluded that this expectation is "silly" and that individuals should do whatever they need to do to navigate this unusual period, whether that means engaging in grand projects or simply taking time to chill and enjoy themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04"></a>.

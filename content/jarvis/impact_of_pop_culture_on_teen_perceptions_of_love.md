The influence of pop culture on [[teenage_romantic_relationships_and_emotions | teenage romantic relationships and emotions]] is significant, with many young people forming their perceptions of love and romance based on media portrayals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the prevalence of "moody romance memes" found on [[influence of social media on modern dating culture | Instagram]], which largely target teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Characteristics of Teen Romance Memes

These Instagram accounts, such as "pointless existence," "one-sided love for you," and "painful writings," are characterized by their moody and emotionally dramatic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. They often feature phrases like "he left, she left, love didn't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The concept of love presented in these memes appears to be derived from popular music and [[high_school_musicals_influence_on_youth_and_popular_culture | bad Disney movies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Some accounts, like "feelings of a teen," explicitly cater to this demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

The content often reflects a highly emotional state, similar to the experience of being a teenager, a time recalled for its "dramatic emotions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The lyrics of artists like Drake are considered partly responsible for this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Unhealthy Perceptions and Themes

Several themes prevalent in these memes promote potentially unhealthy views on relationships:

*   **Obsessive Love:** Many memes suggest that one's entire life, hobbies, and happiness should revolve around a romantic partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Statements like "missing you is my hobby, caring for you is my job, making you happy is my duty, and loving you is my life" illustrate this all-consuming focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This can lead to a perception that giving control of one's feelings to another person is normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Jealousy:** A significant theme in these memes is jealousy, portrayed as a natural or even desirable trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Phrases such as "jealousy when I see you with someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> and "I'm selfish because I don't want to share you with anyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> are common. While natural, jealousy is often considered an unattractive trait and can stem from inner insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. These memes often sound like pop songs that glorify such feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic "Relationship Goals":** The concept of "relationship goals" is frequently featured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. One meme suggests wanting a relationship "like Tom and Jerry, fight daily but still can't live without each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This normalizes constant conflict, despite Tom and Jerry being famous for "trying to kill one another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Other examples show partners being possessive and controlling, such as a boyfriend forbidding a kiss because someone "liked your status on Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Casual Portrayals of Serious Topics:** Pregnancy is a recurring and often ridiculing theme, depicted with simplistic and unrealistic dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Conversations about pregnancy are shown as overly direct and casual, frequently occurring over text, with participants expressing sentiments like "let's get married" immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the gravity of such a life event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Materialism:** Some narratives imply that material possessions are crucial for a relationship or marriage, as seen in a proposal scenario where the woman questions the man's lack of a house or BMW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This promotes a superficial judgment of partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

## Critique of Meme Content

These memes often feature exaggerated and confusing dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. They frequently use call-and-response formats where characters affirm statements with unnecessary questions or unrealistic declarations, such as saying "I want to see your soul naked" in response to "will you force me to sending nudes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

The meme accounts also use engagement tactics like asking users to comment words "letter by letter" to boost their algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Many of these accounts are also used as shopping pages, promoting ads for other businesses, some of which may engage in fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

## Advice for Teenagers

For teenagers feeling confused or overwhelmed by life, it's important to remember that nobody "has it figured out," including adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Key advice includes:
*   Valuing friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   Knowing your worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   Pursuing things you love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   Trying not to obsess over things that are not meant for you right now, as something better could be around the corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   Things will get better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

Content platforms like YouTube feature channels that utilize sensationalist tactics, which can have a significant [[impact_of_misleading_content_on_children|impact of misleading content on children]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These videos often exploit and emotionally manipulate young viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Children, being in their formative years, are particularly susceptible to internalizing false information and potentially harmful ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Characteristics of Sensationalist Content

Channels employing [[sensationalism_in_digital_storytelling|sensationalism in digital storytelling]] often post numerous videos daily, frequently featuring clickbait thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Unlike some channels that use photoshopped images, sensationalist content can "straight up lie" or use "fear-mongering sensationalist tactics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Examples include thumbnails suggesting someone is "out to get you" or advising to "call the police immediately" in unusual scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Despite claims of positivity, common topics in such content can include death, survival scenarios, and dark riddles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Content can also be deceptively structured, with short amounts of actual content padded into longer videos through slow narration and extended pauses, seemingly to increase watch time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The substance of these videos is often minimal, relying on production quality to appear legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## The Issue of Inappropriate Content and Audience

Channels that engage in [[sensationalism_in_animated_stories|sensationalism in animated stories]] or listicles often feature unsettling or inappropriate themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. An example riddle features a man committing suicide by shooting himself between the eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Another describes a man committing suicide by jumping off a train after incorrectly believing he was still blind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

Evidence suggests that the primary audience for such content is children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Comments on videos, like a "math trick" that attempts to guess a viewer's age, frequently reveal that the viewers are as young as 10 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. This raises concerns about [[the_issue_of_inappropriate_childrens_content_on_youtube|inappropriate children's content on YouTube]].

## Corporate Involvement and Ethical Responsibility

Large media publishers often operate these channels, producing a vast amount of content across multiple languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. These "content farms" are criticized for being manipulative and not responsible in their practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. They are seen as using YouTube to extract advertiser dollars from the watching habits of children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

There is a "moral imperative to be responsible with content that children will see" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. The proliferation of such content highlights how market openings can be exploited, with corporations taking advantage of systems for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

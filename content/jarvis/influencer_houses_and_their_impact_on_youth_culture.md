The nation is experiencing a new phenomenon dubbed "FoMO-C," or the [[fomo_and_social_media_influence_on_youth_behaviors | Fear of Missing Clout]], which is reportedly spreading like wildfire among youth [00:00:14]. This cultural shift is closely tied to the rise of social media [[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | influencers]] and the proliferation of "creator houses" [00:00:11, 00:00:20, 00:06:07].

## The Rise of Creator Houses

Creator houses, predominantly featuring TikTok creators, have rapidly multiplied [00:06:07, 00:06:40]. Examples include Hype House, Sway House, and Alpha House [00:06:12, 00:06:13, 00:06:45]. These houses serve as living and content creation spaces for young [[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | influencers]]. For instance, Alpha House, launched during a pandemic, is comprised exclusively of 17 and 18-year-old [[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | influencers]] [00:06:47, 00:06:50, 00:07:36].

Despite ongoing public health concerns, these creator houses have become notorious for hosting large gatherings, often referred to as "quarantine ragers," with little regard for safety protocols like mask-wearing or social distancing [00:00:55, 00:03:27, 00:08:54].

### Jake Paul's Controversial Gatherings
Jake Paul, a prominent YouTuber, has been accused of putting many people at risk by hosting out-of-control parties at his California mansion [00:03:07, 00:03:13, 00:03:17]. Footage from one such event showed partygoers dangerously dangling from an excavator and falling to the ground, with no one wearing masks or social distancing [00:03:21, 00:03:27]. After attending one of Jake Paul's parties, creator Tanner Fox tested positive for coronavirus [00:05:08, 00:05:11]. During a call where Tanner Fox informed Jake Paul of his positive test, participants were heard laughing and yelling, "we don't care," indicating a lack of seriousness [00:05:14, 00:05:43, 00:05:49].

### Alpha House's Immediate Parties
Alpha House notably broke the "speed run record for fastest time from house creation to quarantine party," reportedly having a party almost every night since its launch [00:07:01, 00:07:07]. One party allegedly hosted around 150 people [00:07:13].

### Hype House's Trailblazing Ragers
The Hype House has gained notoriety for its "quarantine ragers" and is described as having "blazed the trail" for partying without masks [00:08:51, 00:08:54, 00:08:56]. Attendees at their parties included well-known [[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | influencers]] like Emma Chamberlain, James Charles, the D'Amelio sisters, and the Sway Boys [00:08:40, 00:08:47, 00:08:50].

### Other Notorious Parties
*   **Sway Gaming House**: Described as a house where people host parties but do not play games [00:10:52, 00:10:57]. It's suggested that Sway Gaming may be "clout chasing" on the name of Sway House [00:11:14, 00:11:16].
*   **Nelk Boys**: This group, known for pranks, has been traveling the country "spreading pranks and coronavirus" [00:11:55, 00:11:59]. They staged a "protest" against gym closures by binge drinking on the street [00:12:15, 00:12:45, 00:13:46]. Their videos also contain disturbing humor, including jokes making light of sexual assault [00:14:02, 00:14:14].
*   **Bryce Hall's 21st Birthday**: Bryce Hall of Sway House hosted a massive 21st birthday party, despite ongoing public criticism of [[influencer_parties_during_the_pandemic | influencer parties]] [00:17:10, 00:17:16]. The event featured male strippers dressed as cops, and actual police eventually showed up [00:18:17, 00:18:24]. Attendees included the Nelk Boys and Faze Banks [00:17:54, 00:17:57].

## Influencer Excuses and Motivations

[[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | Influencers]] often justify their [[influencer_parties_during_the_pandemic | partying]] by claiming it's part of their job [00:09:04, 00:09:10]. Thomas Petrou, founder of Hype House, stated, "Our jobs are to entertain people. We live with groups of people, and we're all intertwined with work. We can't put our entire lives on hold for a year and not make any money" [00:09:24, 00:09:26, 00:09:28, 00:09:30, 00:09:32]. This perspective is criticized as "teen logic" [00:09:37].

The motivation behind these parties often appears to be [[youth_motivation_and_social_media_clout | clout]], [[the_role_of_influencer_marketing | merch]] sales, and maintaining a "reality show in real life" brand that cannot be paused for a pandemic [00:19:02, 00:19:04, 00:19:12, 00:19:13]. Bryce Hall, for example, dropped birthday [[the_role_of_influencer_marketing | merch]] to coincide with his party [00:19:16, 00:19:24].

## Reactions and Consequences

Many [[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | influencers]] have issued apologies for attending these parties, but it's often perceived as "saving face" rather than a change in behavior, as they continue to attend similar events the following weekend [00:15:48, 00:16:17, 00:16:18, 00:16:19]. One 25-year-old creator noted that when they are at these parties, it's "like COVID isn't a thing" [00:16:03, 00:16:05].

Dixie D'Amelio, however, has publicly stated that people should not be going to these parties, though her statement came days after her own birthday party [00:16:24, 00:16:28, 00:16:31].

The City of Los Angeles has threatened to turn off water and power at creator houses that continue to party [00:20:22, 00:20:26]. Bryce Hall's house did have its power shut off, to which he responded, "we deserve it, it is illegal" [00:20:43, 00:20:53, 00:20:54]. Despite this, the underlying issue of defying social distancing guidelines and hosting large gatherings persists, with many still missing the point that it's not about individual [[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | influencers]] contracting the virus, but about the public health risk posed by their actions [00:21:12, 00:21:16, 00:21:21, 00:21:32, 00:21:37, 00:21:40].

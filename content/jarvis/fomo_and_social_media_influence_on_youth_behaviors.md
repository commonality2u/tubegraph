A new phenomenon described as "FOMC" (Fear Of Missing Clout) is reportedly affecting young people, spreading like wildfire across the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This concept describes the pervasive pressure among young YouTubers and TikTok creators to constantly engage in activities, often including large parties, to maintain their online presence and relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Influencer Partying During a Pandemic

Despite public health warnings, many social media [[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | influencers]] have continued to host or attend large gatherings without adhering to safety protocols such as wearing masks or social distancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This behavior has led to widespread criticism and concerns about public health.

### Notable Incidents

*   **Jake Paul's Parties**
    [[Influencer houses and their impact on youth culture | Jake Paul]], a prominent YouTuber, described 2020 as his "biggest year of growth," claiming to have learned much about himself, including that "it's okay to not have all the answers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, his actions quickly contradicted this sentiment.
    *   **Controversial Content** Paul took a stance against YouTube for holding him accountable, claiming they were "shadow banned" him and punishing him for being one of their "riskiest creators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Critics argue his videos contain "dangerous content" and that he is not a good influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   **Out-of-Control Gatherings** Footage emerged from an out-of-control party at his California mansion, showing guests precariously dangling from an excavator without masks or social distancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Despite the clear evidence, Paul's team responded to inquiries with "grass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   **COVID-19 Exposure** After attending Paul's party, creator Tanner Fox tested positive for coronavirus. A video call between Fox and Paul showed them laughing and not taking the diagnosis seriously, with someone in the background yelling, "We don't care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

*   **Creator Houses**
    [[Influencer houses and their impact on youth culture | Creator houses]], predominantly for TikTok creators, have been identified as major party perpetrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Examples include Hype House, Sway House, and Alpha House <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   **Rapid Proliferation** These houses are "multiplying at an alarming rate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Alpha House, launched during the pandemic, reportedly broke the "speed run record for fastest time from house creation to quarantine party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Neighbors and anonymous sources reported the house hosted parties almost every night, with one party having around 150 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   **Age Restrictions?** Alpha House is reportedly comprised exclusively of 17 and 18-year-old [[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | influencers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
    *   **Hype House Excuses** [[Influencer houses and their impact on youth culture | Hype House]] is notorious for its quarantine parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Influencers like Thomas Petrou (founder of Hype House) excuse their behavior by claiming partying is "their job" and that they "can't put our entire lives on hold for a year and not make any money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

*   **The Nelk Boys**
    The Nelk Boys, a Canadian group, have been traveling the country "spreading pranks and coronavirus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
    *   **Gym Protests** They gained notoriety for staging protests against gym closures, with one member, Steve Will Do It, and his trainer, Bradley, engaging in public binge drinking and making light of serious issues like sexual assault in their videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Bradley's gym remained open because he "sees a pandemic and says he sees money signs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

*   **Bryce Hall's 21st Birthday**
    Bryce Hall of Sway House hosted a large 21st birthday party, showing a complete disregard for public health guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. His brand focuses on "trying really really hard to make you think that he doesn't care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, promoting a sense of "authenticity" where everything he posts is "real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
    *   **Party Details** The party featured male strippers dressed as cops and was eventually shut down by actual police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
    *   **Consequences and Response** Initially, nothing happened to Hall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. The Mayor of LA later threatened to cut off water and power to creator houses if they continued partying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. When the power was indeed shut off, Hall responded with, "We deserve it, it is illegal, but we deserve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. His followers argued that his lack of COVID-19 infection meant criticism should stop, missing the point about social distancing and not hosting parties during a pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

### Motivations and Justifications

The primary motivations for these behaviors stem from the nature of the [[impact_of_social_media_on_public_perception_of_success | influencer]] business:
*   **[[Youth motivation and social media clout | Clout]] and Content Generation** Influencers' brands often rely on living out a "reality show in real life," meaning they feel unable to stop for a pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. There is "clout to be gained," "beef to start," and "merch to sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
*   **Financial Pressure** Some influencers, like Thomas Petrou, argue they "can't put our entire lives on hold for a year and not make any money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. However, critics point out they could create content with their housemates rather than large parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Lack of Concern for Consequences** Many influencers appear to not fear any consequences for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. An anonymous 25-year-old creator noted that apologies from [[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | influencers]] are often just "to save face" as they continue to attend parties the following weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

Despite the pervasive nature of these behaviors, some [[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | influencers]], like Dixie D'Amelio, have spoken out against attending such parties, though this often occurs after they themselves have hosted large gatherings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

On June 8th, the YouTube channel [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]], known for its animated stories, appeared to have vanished without a trace, prompting an investigation into what occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Channel Overview
[[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] began two years prior to its disappearance, claiming to animate children's stories with professional voice actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. However, the authenticity of these stories was questioned, as many were found to be nearly verbatim copies from old Reddit threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Over time, the channel transitioned from stories "ripped straight off of Reddit" to "provably untrue stories" that contained just enough detail to confirm their fabricated nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Later, they even shifted focus to include stories seemingly told by real-life celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Billie Eilish, and Jackie Chan, from a first-person perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This contributed to [[the_fake_nature_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | the fake nature of the YouTube channel Actually Happened]].

## The Disappearance
While the channel's page itself remains active, all its videos have been made private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This action resulted in the evaporation of over 1.5 billion views overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Theories Explaining the Vanishing

There are several theories regarding the sudden disappearance of [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]]'s videos, though none can be definitively verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### YouTube Action
One initial theory suggested that YouTube took down the channel, possibly due to discussions by various creators, including Vsauce Jarvis himself, about the channel's content over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. However, this is unlikely because when YouTube takes down a channel, it typically displays a suspension notice for rule violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. In the case of [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]], the channel page is still present, albeit with all videos made private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Videos Made Private
The fact that the videos are private rather than deleted suggests an intentional action by the channel's owners, as deleting is permanent while making videos private is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. An unlisted video can only be accessed via its link, while a private video can only be viewed by the channel owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The videos for [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] are confirmed to be private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Parent Company Strategy
[[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] was managed by TheSoul Publishing, the same group behind channels like 5-Minute Crafts and Bright Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Although TheSoul Publishing's website previously listed [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] among its properties, it has since been removed, indicating the removal was intentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
TheSoul Publishing has a known tactic of reposting content from old channels to new ones, as observed with 5-Minute Crafts' sister channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This led to speculation that [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] might be planning to re-release itself under a new identity to find a new audience base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. However, this theory is undermined by the decision to privatize all videos, which were highly monetized and potentially earning around $400,000 per month, totaling approximately $5 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. It seems illogical for a business to halt such considerable revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Legal Battle
A more plausible explanation is that a legal battle forced the channel to make its videos private to prevent further revenue generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Since deleting the videos would be a permanent and irreversible action, making them private would be the only viable alternative in such a scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Lack of Official Communication
Unlike a normal creator whose entire library of videos disappears, there has been no official statement or communication from [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This is attributed to the channel being a corporate entity focused on money-making rather than a person with a community or social media presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Broader Context of Animated Story Channels
[[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] is not unique in its approach. It originated as a copycat of [[comparisons_between_actually_happened_and_storybooth | Storybooth]], a legitimate channel that works with children and their families to tell their real stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]]'s success led to a proliferation of similar animated story channels, often using permutations of words like "story," "animated," "happened," and "my" in their names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
Many of these channels, such as "My Story Animated," which is founded by an Israeli app developer, are considered more egregious offenders than [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] due to their "sensationalist fake stories that only serve to manipulate the emotions of children for views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Examples of their content include titles like "I eat scorpions for breakfast to become poisonous" or "I am a bodybuilder and my boyfriend is a tiny little guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This points to a larger problem regarding the [[critique_of_actually_happened_youtube_channel | critique of Actually Happened YouTube channel]] and similar channels.

The mystery of what "actually happened" to [[the_disappearance_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] remains unsolved, with no concrete facts available to confirm any of the theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Online advice on becoming a software engineer is often scarce and confusing, despite numerous resources available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Much of this advice is misleading and can be attributed to survivorship bias, where successful individuals present their unique path as the only viable one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Critique of Online Software Engineering Advice

Many online resources offer problematic advice for aspiring software engineers, often failing to account for varied paths and perpetuating unrealistic expectations.

### wikiHow's Approach to Becoming a Software Engineer

A wikiHow article titled "How to Become a Software Engineer" offers advice that is both reader-approved and co-authored by many, yet it presents several questionable points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>:

*   **Degree Requirements**: The article suggests earning a degree in software engineering provides the "most useful background" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. However, computer science is actually the most common major for software engineers, with software engineering majors being rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. While computer science is described as "more theoretical," most programs integrate software engineering elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Early Programming**: The advice "begin programming immediately" suggests starting in grade school to get a "huge head start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This implies an unrealistic expectation for young individuals and a specific, early start that isn't universally necessary. Learning programming languages is also presented as a detached activity, when it's more effective to apply them by building something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Math**: The article states software engineers "sometimes create mathematical algorithms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. While true for specific roles (e.g., physics engines for video games), it's not a universal requirement for all software engineering jobs, such as building a blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Incoherent Steps**: The list of steps, such as studying math *after* getting a degree and beginning programming immediately, lacks logical flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. For those switching careers, the advice essentially recommends starting over by enrolling in a degree program after already programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

The advice from wikiHow is criticised for being unhelpful and not reflecting the reality that many people with unrelated degrees enter software engineering through coding boot camps and online resources, avoiding the need for another four-year institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Hacker Noon's Intensity and Elitism

An article from Hacker Noon, "Want to become a software developer? Here's how to get there," begins with a warning that "programming is not for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This contributes to a sense of exclusivity and a [[psychological_impact_of_negativity_bias | negativity bias]] around the field.

The article emphasizes:

*   **Immense Dedication**: It claims the field "requires immense dedication," implying that those who are not "immensely dedicated" will not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This overlooks that many software engineers simply "work to live" without extreme dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   [[the_importance_of_genuine_passion_in_career_success | Passion]]: It states that passion "has to happen somewhere down the road, otherwise you're gonna be mercilessly left behind by those who are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. While passion can foster investment, insisting on it as a prerequisite is problematic, as many successful individuals are not as passionate as this author <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Waiting for passion can also hinder progress by leading to second-guessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Challenging Nature**: The article describes the work as "challenging," involving "long hours of mentally taxing work," "impossible deadlines," and "unmaintainable code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This portrayal is criticized as an exaggerated self-congratulatory tone, making the job sound like a "Thunderdome" rather than a typical career with challenging and rewarding aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Taught Requirement**: It claims software engineering requires you to "be self-taught," implying that "nobody's gonna be there to hold your hand" when code breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This ignores the collaborative nature of the industry, where teams support each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

This type of advice "reeks of survivorship bias and like a superiority complex," suggesting "the only way to do it is how I did it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. It contributes to a "toxic bull" culture that makes the industry uninviting to those who don't fit a specific mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Business Insider's Market Crash Tips

An article from Business Insider offers "seventeen tips on how to keep your software engineering job even during a market crash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This advice is also criticized for being unhelpful and sometimes absurd:

*   **Lowering the Bar**: Suggestions like "work in an area where even a mediocre engineer can have stability" or "sometimes not having a high salary helps" are presented as ways to avoid job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This discourages ambition and self-respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Vague Instructions**: Advice such as "show true dedication" and "interview well" are so general they are useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **"Recession-Proof Industry"**: The article advises working in a "recession-proof industry," which is easier said than done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Build a Personal Brand**: While building a personal brand is generally fine advice, the context and accompanying image in the article are mocked for being nonsensical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Other Unrelated "Tips"

Online advice can also include completely irrelevant or impractical suggestions, such as "20 tips if you spend your life in front of a computer" from *Five Minute Crafts* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. These "tips" include bizarre "life hacks" like using putty to create keyboard imprints or transforming a hoodie into a laptop backpack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. This highlights the prevalence of general, unhelpful content masquerading as career guidance.

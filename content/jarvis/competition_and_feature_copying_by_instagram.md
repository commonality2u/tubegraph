## Instagram's Competitive Strategy and Feature Copying

A common complaint about social media platforms like Instagram is the blending of content from friends with that from publishers, creators, and influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach has led to questions about the nature of these platforms, particularly concerning their competitive tactics, such as the direct imitation of features from rival applications.

### The Rise and Fall of Snapchat and Instagram's Role

Snapchat experienced a significant decline in its perceived value and user engagement, with a notable event being Kylie Jenner's tweet which reportedly wiped out over a billion dollars in the app's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This dramatic drop in stock value was, at least in part, attributed to Jenner's public disengagement from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

A major factor in Snapchat's struggle was the widespread [[social_media_platforms_and_content_imitation | content imitation]] by other social media applications, most notably Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Snapchat had pioneered features such as disappearing photos, wacky face filters, and "stories," all of which were subsequently "ripped off" by competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

It is suggested that Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta (formerly Facebook), attempted to acquire Snapchat, and upon rejection, proceeded to replicate Snapchat's most successful features within Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This aggressive strategy contributed to Snapchat being "robbed of its identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Despite Snapchat employing leading experts in computer vision and machine learning to develop unique features like dog ear filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, users often captured content on Snapchat only to share it on platforms like Twitter and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Snapchat's Struggle for Identity Amidst Competition

Snapchat now faces significant challenges in competing with the likes of Instagram and [[influence_of_apps_like_tiktok_on_instagram | TikTok]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. One of its few features that has not been widely copied is "Snapchat Discover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. However, Discover has evolved into a repository of what is described as "the internet's worst clickbait," featuring a disparate mix of content from serious news to sensationalized headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Initially, Discover aimed to garner respect by partnering with major media companies such as National Geographic, ESPN, and CNN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Over time, its content shifted to include shows by entities like "Five-Minute Crafts" and collections of repurposed content from other parts of the internet, often reformatted poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Examples of this content include:

*   **Dobre Brothers' show**: Featuring pranks, such as freezing a MacBook in ice, which are critiqued for being poorly executed and unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. These shows often appear to be unsuited for the Snapchat format, with videos not reframed for vertical viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Phony Texts**: Described as a "lowest effort series" consisting of fake iMessage conversations, which are critiqued for their nonsensical plots and explicit product placements (e.g., Coin Master, featuring Kris Jenner and Scott Disick) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Snapchat monetizes this content through frequent and haphazardly placed ads, which are often inserted without regard for natural pauses in the short-form content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The platform's recommendations are also criticized for not being personalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

The overall state of Snapchat is viewed as sad, having lost its initial promise and identity to become something akin to the BuzzFeed homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. What was once a favorite app for sharing ephemeral memories among friends has largely diminished in its original purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

*Love is Blind* is presented as a marriage game show where participants aim to get married after interacting with others through a wall, without being able to see them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The premise is that connections become strong enough for participants to propose, get married, and then potentially regret it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Pod Dating:** Individuals date each other "Behind These Walls" where they cannot see one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
2.  **Resort Life:** After proposals, couples go to a resort to "simulate cohabitating and life together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
3.  **Real World & Marriage:** They then return to the real world to try and make their relationship work, with the pressure to get married within three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The core objective is to "find love without seeing the person that you're dating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, based on the idea that if the connection is strong enough, it should lead to marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Criticisms of the Show's Approach

The show's format and stated intentions face several [[love_is_blind_show_format_critique | criticisms of the show's format]].

### Misrepresentation as an "Experiment"
The show repeatedly refers to itself as an "experiment," but this is critiqued as a misrepresentation. It is argued that *Love is Blind* is not a true [[experiment_on_love_being_blind | experiment]] but rather a "reality concept" that takes itself "so seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This highlights a common [[critique_of_reality_tv_and_its_portrayal_of_relationships | critique of reality TV and its portrayal of relationships]].

### Rushing into Marriage
Despite the show's focus on marriage, some contestants, like Shake, suggest it's more about finding love and not about "skipping steps in a relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. However, this contradicts the show's core premise, which involves getting married potentially after only a month of dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. The speaker points out that the show's format inherently involves rushing into a commitment, making Shake's comment ironic given the context of the program he's on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Contestants Misunderstanding the Premise
Some participants, like Shake, appear to fundamentally misunderstand the show's concept. He openly admits that finding love "without seeing the person" isn't enough for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. He also asserts that the show isn't about rushing into marriage, despite that being the central hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The speaker notes that Shake seems to believe he's on a show about "traditional relationships" where physical sight is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. His repeated statements about not wanting to be "put in a box" where he can't see his partner, despite being on *Love is Blind*, underscore a significant disconnect with the show's format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This highlights a [[criticisms_of_the_shows_approach_to_dating | critique of the dating show's approach]] and the participants' understanding of it.

### Host Intervention and Critique
A rare moment occurs during the reunion where host Vanessa Lachey directly [[critique_of_dating_show_premises | critiques]] a contestant, Shake, for his behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Lachey questions why he participated in *Love is Blind* if physical attraction was his primary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. This direct confrontation from a host to a contestant is noted as an unusual and impactful occurrence, signaling a significant departure from typical reality show hosting dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. This contrasts with other programs like [[comparison_with_other_dating_shows_like_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]], where hosts typically maintain a more neutral stance.

Overall, the discussion underscores the tension between *Love is Blind*'s stated goal of transcending physical attraction and the realities of human relationships, often highlighted by the actions and attitudes of its participants.

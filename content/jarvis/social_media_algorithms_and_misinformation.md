From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Social media platforms are widely accessible, allowing anyone to publish content online, a practice that has been described as an "oversight" due to the prevalence of misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This environment has led to the rise of "content farms," which produce [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | viral trends]] and content primarily designed to "harvest clicks for views" rather than provide accurate information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

## The Influence of Algorithms and Misinformation

One significant aspect of modern [[social_media_platforms_and_content_imitation | social media platforms]] is the role of algorithms in shaping user feeds. These algorithms can inadvertently promote misleading content, influencing users' perceptions and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. For example, a Facebook algorithm, known for its "bulletproof track record," might suggest that a user's food is "fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, leading them down rabbit holes of conspiracy theories, such as 9/11 being an "inside job" or public figures being "lizard people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The continuous scrolling on platforms like Facebook can be influenced by these algorithms, even though users might perceive their engagement as their own choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Blossom's "Is Your Food Fake?" Video

The video "Is your food fake or real? Find out with these 16 easy tests at home!" by Blossom, a content farm similar to "5 Minute Crafts," serves as a prime example of online misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This video garnered 100 million views on Facebook alone within days of its release, also going [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | viral]] on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. It introduces problems that "no one in modern society has to worry about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### Debunked Claims from Blossom's Video

The video presents several "tests" to determine if food is fake, all of which are easily debunked or based on [[analyzing_misleading_and_poorly_researched_facts_in_online_content | misleading and poorly researched facts]]:

*   **Processed vs. Natural Cheese**
    *   **Claim:** Processed cheese doesn't melt well, implying it's fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Debunking:** Processed cheese is designed to melt easily and is a common purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. Any food held near a flame will blacken and burn, regardless of whether it's "natural" or "processed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. Testing with a flame to melt both processed American cheese and natural cheddar showed similar burning and bubbling when held close enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

*   **Wax on Vegetables**
    *   The video suggests some vegetables are coated in wax without proper context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. While some wax is harmless, the general advice is to wash vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

*   **Melting Supplements**
    *   **Claim:** If supplements melt when heated, they are "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
    *   **Debunking:** This claim is unsubstantiated and could be applied to anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

*   **Plastic Rice**
    *   **Claim:** Rice is mixed with plastic because it's too expensive, and heating it will reveal transparency instead of melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Debunking:** Plastic is made from oil, one of the cheapest commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. It is illogical to mix cheap plastic with rice to reduce cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. This claim ignores that rice is a staple for "half of Earth's population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, and no widespread issue has been reported. Heating is an "unavoidable part of the cooking process" for rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

*   **Ground-Up Rocks in Baby Food**
    *   **Claim:** Baby food contains "ground up rocks," detectable with a magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.
    *   **Debunking:** Rocks are minerals, and essential minerals like calcium and iron are naturally present or added to food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. Iron, a magnetic mineral, is supposed to be in baby food and cereals like Kellogg's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

*   **Seaweed Test for "Pure Milk"**
    *   **Claim:** Milk will turn blue if seaweed is added, unless it is "pure milk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Debunking:** The concept of "pure milk" without any processing is unclear, as most milk undergoes pasteurization to prevent diseases like typhoid fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Whole milk is only 4% fat, meaning 96% of "something" has been removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. A demonstration shows that adding seaweed to milk does not turn it blue; however, adding blue dye does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

*   **Floating Coffee Additives**
    *   **Claim:** "Pure coffee sinks," while "coffee with additives floats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Debunking:** This is a direct lie; fresh coffee floats, and stale coffee sinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. A demonstration shows stale coffee sinking and fresh coffee floating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:9:00">[13:9:00]</a>.

*   **Chalk in Salt**
    *   **Claim:** Salt is mixed with chalk, which will not dissolve immediately in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Debunking:** It is normal for salt not to dissolve immediately when poured into water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>. The video doesn't show "pure salt" being put into water because the premise is false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>. A demonstration shows that pouring salt into water causes cloudiness due to insoluble salt, which eventually clears up over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.

### The Business of Misinformation

Content farms like Blossom profit from these misleading videos. They aim for clicks, not accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>. The business model relies on attracting large audiences, leading to "grand partnerships" and advertising revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. Blossom, for instance, built a Facebook page with 51 million followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. Their ads for other brands, like teeth whitening products or a "health app," sometimes contain misleading or strange scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. This highlights how these platforms engage in [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing strategies]] that prioritize engagement over factual representation.

## Implications and Vigilance

The presentation of misinformation, even if "partially related to the truth" or based on isolated incidents (like a fake green peas story in China nine years prior), is still factually incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. These videos often lack context or sources for their claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. The overall message, "TRUST NO ONE" and "KNOW THE FOOD YOU EAT," is ironic given the purveyor's own misleading content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>. It suggests that while vigilance about food content is encouraged, it's equally important to be discerning about the content in one's social media feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>.

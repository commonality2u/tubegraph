Issues surrounding identity theft and social media are explored through a segment from the television show *Judge Jerry*, which features cases that often deal with unusual circumstances involving [[Social Media Algorithms and Misinformation | online interactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

## Case: "She's a Thick White Girl"

In an episode of *Judge Jerry*, plaintiff Adam Davis claims his former "friends with benefits" partner stole his identity after he broke off their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. Davis states that the defendant was "pretending to be him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.

### The Plaintiff: An Instagram Influencer

Adam Davis identifies himself as an "Instagram influencer" from Dallas, Texas, with 23,000 followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. He explains that his job involves "getting paid to take pictures in people's clothes" and "post their pages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

### The Identity Theft Allegations

Davis claims that after he stopped talking to the defendant, "fake accounts" of him began appearing on Instagram, Tinder, and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>. These accounts used his picture but with a "different name" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. The defendant allegedly used these [[Tactics and implications of creating fake online personas | fake personas]] to "get money from people" by setting up photo shoots and then not showing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. Money was reportedly sent to these "fake sites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>.

Despite the fake accounts using a different name, Davis claims this activity was "blacklisting" him in Dallas and hurting his reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>.

### Evidence and Judgment

As evidence, Davis presented a printout of his Instagram profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>. Judge Jerry jokingly suggested that printing things out is a "foolproof way to prevent identity theft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>, but then noted that such evidence could "easily be photoshopped" and is "full of security holes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.

The defendant eventually admitted to setting up the fake accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>. Judge Jerry, in a serious tone, emphasized that stealing someone's identity is "not good" and can lead to prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>. He found in favor of the plaintiff, noting the defendant's initial lie and the printed evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.

The [[High School Musical the Musical the Series | High School Musical]] film series explores character development, though its approach varies significantly between installments. Notably, the second film, [[High School Musical 2 plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]], largely disregards the growth seen in the first movie, leading to a perceived "amnesia" of character arcs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:30">[05:28:30]</a>.

### Character Regression in High School Musical 2

Many characters in [[High School Musical 2 plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]] appear to regress or restart their development, effectively beginning from "scratch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:09">[05:23:09]</a>.

*   **Sharpay Evans**: Despite an apparent character arc in the first film where she eventually joins the team and sings "We're All in This Together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>, Sharpay in [[High School Musical 2 plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]] is once again "hell-bent on ruining Gabriella's life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:24">[11:43:24]</a>. She assumes a tyrannical role at Lava Springs, enlisting Fulton to make the Wildcats want to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:56">[11:50:56]</a>. Her antics are described as "a little more messed up" than in the previous movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:04">[15:47:04]</a>. She uses her influence to secure a basketball scholarship opportunity for Troy, but then forces him into performing with her and steals Kelsi's song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:06">[21:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:05">[21:06:05]</a>.
*   **Troy Bolton**: In the original film, Troy breaks stereotypes by pursuing singing alongside basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:34">[04:17:34]</a>. However, in [[High School Musical 2 plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]], the central conflict revolves around his change, prioritizing his future and potential basketball scholarship over his girlfriend and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:12">[16:14:12]</a>. He gives Gabriella a "narcissistic" T-shaped necklace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:57">[07:49:57]</a>. His actions lead him to neglect Gabriella and rehearse with Sharpay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>, and he is seen in his "elitism bag" with college basketball players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:08">[20:43:08]</a>. Ultimately, he comes to realize his mistake, walking out on a performance with Sharpay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:39">[28:34:39]</a> and apologizing to his friends, stating he needs to focus on what truly matters: his friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:06">[29:06:06]</a>.
*   **Gabriella Montez**: In the first film, Gabriella is introduced as a "freaky genius girl" who can sing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, winning the academic decathlon and getting a part in the musical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:07">[04:42:07]</a>. In [[High School Musical 2 plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]], however, her "freaky genius girl" qualities are largely removed, making her feel like "just an accessory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>. She confronts Troy about his changed personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:04">[21:10:04]</a> before choosing to "go her own way" and leave the resort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>, returning the T-necklace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:05">[25:06:05]</a>.
*   **Chad Danforth**: Initially a "human basketball" and "theater kid who hates theater" in [[High School Musical movie plot and review | HSM1]], Chad eventually supports Troy's singing career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:09">[04:23:09]</a>. In [[High School Musical 2 plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]], he is seen "indisputably dancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:43">[13:01:43]</a> and even kisses Miss Darbus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>. He later swaps clothes with Ryan Evans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:07">[22:31:07]</a> and appears to take on elements of Troy's past role, flirting with Gabriella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:25">[22:41:25]</a>.
*   **Ryan Evans**: Described as the "most underutilized member of the cast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:02">[10:40:02]</a>, Ryan gains significant development in [[High School Musical 2 plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]]. He has an "iconic showing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:09">[10:44:09]</a> and becomes the "star of the movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. His character is noted for having sexual tension with Chad during "I Don't Dance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>, with the director Kenny Ortega implying Ryan's character was gay but Disney Channel was not ready for that conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>. Ryan eventually "defects" to the basketball boys and becomes the "new Troy," even flirting with Gabriella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:25">[22:41:25]</a>. He plays a crucial role in bringing Troy back to the Wildcats and ensuring Sharpay gets her deserved moment in the spotlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:52:00">[29:52:00]</a>.
*   **Kelsi Nielsen**: As the in-universe composer, Kelsi has a "magical ability to imbue Troy and Gabriella with her music and lyrics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>, allowing them to sing and harmonize without rehearsal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. Her musical talent is a consistent thread that drives the plot.
*   **Fulton**: Initially portrayed as a villainous "henchman" for Sharpay, Fulton is later shown to be a man who simply doesn't want to lose his job, taking orders from a child to secure his paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>. This provides a brief moment of genuine empathy for his character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:18:00">[24:18:00]</a>.
*   **Troy's Dad (Basketball Dad)**: Consistently portrayed as "unhelpful" and only able to think about things in terms of basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>. He struggles to emotionally support Troy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:06">[29:06:06]</a>.
*   **Mrs. Bolton**: She is presented as a "vibe killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>, perpetuating a perceived "anti-mom propaganda" trend in Disney Channel productions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

### Conclusion

While [[High School Musical movie plot and review | High School Musical 1]] established clear character arcs, [[High School Musical 2 plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]] chooses to reset much of this development, focusing instead on new conflicts and character dynamics. This allows for new narrative possibilities, particularly highlighting the growth of Ryan Evans and offering a deeper, albeit brief, look at secondary characters like Fulton. The overall approach, however, leads to a discontinuity in the personal journeys of the main protagonists like Troy, Gabriella, and Sharpay.

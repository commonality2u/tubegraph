The commentary emphasizes the unrealistic nature of the "Troom Troom world" and the questionable utility of their supposed "life hacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Overview of Troom Troom Content

Troom Troom is a YouTube channel known for its "life hack" videos, which often feature bizarre and impractical solutions to everyday problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The channel has a substantial subscriber base, reaching 20 million subscribers at the time of this video's commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The discussed video, "11 Ways to Sneak Fast Food into the Movies," was released in July 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

## General [[criticism_of_lowquality_content_on_youtube_channels | Critique of Video Tutorials]]

The core premise of the video – sneaking food into movies – is immediately questioned, as it is generally "not very difficult" to do so, often requiring "all you need is a bag and some fast food or snack food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The video's usefulness is also challenged given the context of a pandemic in July 2020, when many people were not attending movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Despite this, "Troom Troom world people are going to movies all the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The commentary points out that Troom Troom's "life hacks" often introduce more problems than they solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The overall quality of the content is described as "silly," "dumb and bad," and "impractical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Absurd and Impractical "Life Hacks"

Many of the proposed "hacks" in the video are critiqued for their extreme impracticality and bizarre nature:

*   **Mermaid with "Tasty Fish" Earrings**
    *   The video opens with a mermaid character whose earrings are made of "tasty fish," which is explicitly not fast food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   The concept raises questions about "cannibalism" if a mermaid were to eat fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    *   This initial scene sets the tone for the video's lack of realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

*   **Giant Cheeseburger Pregnancy**
    *   One "hack" involves "cooking a comically large burger" the "size of the whole pan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The recipe details are also questioned for their lack of specificity and realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   The method for sneaking it in is to pretend to be pregnant using the large burger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
    *   A significant [[critique_of_video_scripting_and_storytelling | narrative flaw]] is that a security guard would give a ticket to a "baby" (the burger) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
    *   The burger is shown to be freezing cold with unmelted cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

*   **Snack Queen Tiara**
    *   A character attempts to sneak in snacks by wearing a "canopy tiara" made of cheese and olives on skewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
    *   The commentator notes the use of "spray paint" on the skewers, rendering them inedible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   The premise that this "hack" is to provide food for an entire theater of snack-deprived people is highlighted as absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

*   **Boxing Glove Snacks**
    *   This segment depicts sneaking snacks into boxing gloves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   The "hack" involves an unlikely scenario where a boxer is conveniently present and easily apprehended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
    *   The snacks turn to "dust" after a fight sequence, despite minimal contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

*   **French Fries in a Bag (then not in a bag)**
    *   The video shows using a purse to sneak in french fries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
    *   However, the fries are then "dumped out" onto a "disgusting" surface, and a "giant ketchup container" appears inexplicably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
    *   The segment critiques the abandonment of the initial, more practical "bag" idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

*   **Burrito "Portable Charger"**
    *   A character creates a "portable charger" box to hide burrito ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
    *   The "tortilla in a folder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a> instruction is singled out as particularly nonsensical.
    *   The "portable set for a mini burrito" is so small it can't be properly folded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

*   **Burger Breast Enhancement Surgery**
    *   A woman attempts to sneak burgers in by placing them inside her bra to make her chest "bigger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
    *   The scenario then devolves into a mock "burger enhancement surgery" with a doctor and a discussion of burger sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
    *   A male character attempts the same "hack," resulting in him falling due to the burgers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

*   **Chicken Leg Soda Cup**
    *   A "fried chicken leg" is placed on a skewer inside a soda cup, with a printed picture of soda on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.
    *   The depiction of the chicken leg is criticized for not resembling actual fried chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.
    *   The security guard is depicted as failing to look inside the cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
    *   An absurd consequence is shown where a "soda melted my chicken" due to a "hydrochloric acid" drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

## Problematic Cultural Depictions

A segment featuring "Japanese food" is heavily criticized for its stereotypical and inaccurate portrayal of Japanese culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Guest Maiuko, an iOS engineer and content creator, provides additional commentary:

*   **Stereotypical Music**: The background music is described as "generically Asian Japanese" and "pentatonic scale with some sort of tycho sounding drum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Inaccurate Bowing**: The video shows a character bowing with hands together, which is incorrect; Japanese people typically bow with their hands at their sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Sushi as Jewelry/Hair Accessories**: The character wears sushi as earrings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, and uses chopsticks from her hair to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Both are deemed "gross" and impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **Lack of Cultural Understanding**: Maiuko states that the portrayal "doesn't do service to the Japanese weirdness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a> and suggests "zero effort" was put into accuracy, with "no Asian people or Japanese people in the writing or production of this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   **Fishy Smell**: The "dried sardines" worn by the mermaid character cause an overwhelming "smell of fish" that drives other movie-goers away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Similar Channels

The commentary notes that movie posters within the Troom Troom video are photoshopped to include the word "WooHoo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. It is discovered that "WooHoo" is a "very similar channel to Troom Troom," also producing videos on topics like sneaking snacks into movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. This suggests a trend of similar channels multiplying on YouTube, often with comparable [[analysis_of_5minute_crafts_video_format_and_content | low-quality content and formats]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

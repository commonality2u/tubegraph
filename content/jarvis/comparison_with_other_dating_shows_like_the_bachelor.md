## Key Differences in Premise
A significant difference lies in the pacing of relationships and engagements:
*   **Engagement Timeline:** [[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]] films over approximately ten weeks before an engagement occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. In contrast, *Love is Blind* participants are expected to get engaged within ten days or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, with one couple even getting engaged in three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This rapid progression leads to the show being jokingly referred to as "Love is Swift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Initial Interaction:** While not explicitly contrasted, the core premise of *Love is Blind* involves people getting engaged to someone they have never seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, which is a departure from traditional dating show formats where physical appearance is immediately apparent.

This highlights a perceived motivation for contestants beyond genuine love, suggesting a focus on [[the_bachelor_contestant_stereotypes | external validation]] or social media fame.

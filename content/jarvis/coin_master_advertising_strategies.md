The mobile game [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]] is notable for its pervasive and often unusual advertising campaigns, particularly those featured on platforms like [[snapchats_advertising_and_content_strategies | Snapchat]] [00:00:54].

## Celebrity Endorsements

[[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]] has heavily relied on [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | celebrity endorsements]] in its advertisements [00:01:38]. Some of the notable figures who have appeared in these ads include:
*   [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | Kris Jenner]], who appeared in an ad showing up at someone's house to extort "video game dollars" for [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]] [00:01:11], demanding "10% of your coins" [00:01:22].
*   [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | Khloe Kardashian]] was also featured in ads [00:01:24].
*   Morgz, a YouTuber, has done ads with [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]] [00:01:30].
*   [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | Terry Crews]] [00:01:40].
*   [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | Jennifer Lopez]] [00:01:45].
*   The [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | Real Housewives]] [00:01:45].
*   [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | Scott Disick]] is portrayed as "the coin master" in some ads [00:02:10].
*   Even musicians like Rae Sremmurd have uploaded [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]] content to their official YouTube channels [00:06:03], featuring a rap about chasing coins [00:06:10] and projecting the [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]] logo [00:06:19].

The scale of these endorsements suggests that "pretty much every celebrity has done these ads at this point" [00:01:38].

## Ad Content and Misrepresentation

The advertisements for [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]] often create a [[misleading_mobile_game_ads | misleading impression]] of the actual game experience [00:02:22].
*   **Dramatic Scenarios:** Ads depict dramatic real-world interactions, such as [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | Kris Jenner]] arriving at a woman's house to demand coins [00:02:29], or [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | Jennifer Lopez]] stating, "I used to be full of hope, and then the coin master taught me to kill" [00:03:32].
*   **Aggressive Themes:** Ads imply the game involves "actual war" [00:03:24] and depict "too much violence" [00:07:01], suggesting a "hard" or intense gameplay experience [00:07:08].
*   **Psychological Association:** The ads attempt to build a "psychological association" between terms like "[[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]]" and [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | Jennifer Lopez]], seemingly to link the celebrity to the game [00:03:40].
*   **"More Than Just a Game":** The tagline "more than just a game" is used in ads [00:03:21], even as other ad dialogue suggests the opposite: "don't be so dramatic, it's just a game" [00:04:48].
*   **Unclear Gameplay:** Many ads make it difficult to understand the actual mechanics of the game [00:05:14], often featuring loud and seemingly nonsensical celebrity interactions [00:05:19]. They suggest that the game involves attacking "random celebrities with the powers of Thor" [00:02:52] or that players can raid villages [00:08:37].

Despite the dramatic and high-stakes scenarios depicted in the ads, the actual gameplay is described as being primarily about spinning a slot machine and raiding villages [00:08:40]. The ads, unlike the game, do not feature [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | Kris Jenner]] [00:15:39] or other celebrities being attacked or extorted within the game [00:02:47].

## Financial Backing for Advertising

The ability of [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]] to afford such a vast array of [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | celebrity endorsements]] is linked to its financial success [00:07:54]. The game, released in 2016 [00:07:58], is a "top grossing mobile game" in the UK and Germany, and is "top five in the US" [00:08:00]. This success comes from "sweet sweet microtransaction dollars" [00:08:12].

[[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]] was developed by Moon Active, an Israeli game studio [00:08:14]. One of [[coin_master_game_mechanics_and_gameplay_experience | Coin Master]]'s top investors is Gigi Levi Weiss, the CEO of an online casino company [00:21:03], which raises questions about the game's intent to "build a harmful habit" akin to gambling [00:21:14].

## Advertising for Addiction

The game's design, combined with its advertising, appears "scientifically engineered to cause a gambling addiction" [00:20:47]. The pervasive [[misleading_mobile_game_ads | misleading mobile game ads]], particularly those featuring [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | celebrities promoting Coin Master]], often obscure the true nature of the game, which is primarily a slot machine with "frequent / intense simulated gambling" [00:20:36]. Notifications and in-game "gifts" also encourage continued play and spending [00:18:26].

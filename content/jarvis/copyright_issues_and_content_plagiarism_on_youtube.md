YouTube has faced significant challenges concerning content quality, original creation, and the widespread practice of content appropriation, leading to [[Fair use and copyright issues on YouTube | copyright issues]] and the proliferation of [[Content farms on YouTube | content farms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This includes videos that are "vapid and exploitative" and "emotionally manipulate the children who watch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, resulting in a negative experience for both advertisers and viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Case Study: Bright Side

Bright Side is identified as one of the largest channels on YouTube, boasting approximately 16 million subscribers within a year and a half of its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The channel's rapid growth is attributed not to unique, well-researched, or highly produced content from an independent creator, but rather to **stealing from other channels** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Content Practices

Bright Side typically posts 10 to 15-minute videos three times a day, a strategy likened to the "Five-Minute Crafts playbook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Their content often features [[Criticism of sensationalist content on YouTube | clickbait thumbnails]] that are outright lies or employ "fear-mongering sensationalist tactics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Examples include "call the police immediately" thumbnails related to everyday objects like a cookie under a doormat or a coin in a car door handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Despite their channel description claiming to "always look on the bright side of life and stay positive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, one of their most common topics is death, with titles like "Five riddles you must solve to stay alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Lack of Substance and Padding

Bright Side videos are characterized by a profound lack of substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. An example video, "11 witty texts from the geniuses of flirting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, features content that feels algorithmically generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> and often contains inappropriate or nonsensical interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The content is often "devoid of substance," and when it does have substance, it's typically unsourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

Another example, "Ten things you should never Google" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, is criticized for its slow narration, long pauses, and vague fear-mongering tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, with the core message being simply "don't Google things that you're afraid of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

Bright Side heavily utilizes padding to extend video length and game engagement metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. In riddle videos like "Nine riddles only people with high IQs can solve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, 20-second pauses are inserted between riddles, creating "three minutes of blank space" to inflate watch time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The riddles themselves are often unsolvable without introducing new, unstated information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> or feature dark, violent themes such as suicide and death, despite the channel's positive branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

### Evidence of Plagiarism

Bright Side frequently paraphrases or directly copies content from other YouTube creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Direct Copying
> Videos like "Illegal things that you do every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a> show direct overlap in content and exactly the same thumbnails (with redrawn art) as videos from "The Infographic Show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Another instance is "The coastline paradox has finally been explained," which features a stolen and photoshopped thumbnail from another channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Similarly, a video about putting vinegar in a toilet uses the exact same processed photo as a video released six months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

### Target Audience: Children

Evidence from comments on videos like "This math trick will guess your age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a> reveals that Bright Side's audience predominantly consists of children, with many comments indicating viewers as young as 10 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. This raises [[The issue of inappropriate children's content on YouTube | ethical concerns about content appropriation on YouTube]] and [[Ethical concerns about content appropriation on YouTube | responsibility with content for children]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

## The Corporate Entity: TheSoul Publishing

Bright Side, along with Five-Minute Crafts, is operated by **TheSoul Publishing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. This company identifies itself as "one of the largest media publishers in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, focusing on "universally shareable positive content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

### Scale of Operations

TheSoul Publishing is a "gigantic company" and a prime example of a [[Content farms on YouTube | content farm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. They produce an astonishing **1,500 videos a month** in ten different languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

### Discrepancy Between Claims and Reality

The company's self-description on its website, particularly a page titled "How We Make Bright Side," claims an "overriding goal to achieve perfection" and states that "every individual article we write is like a diamond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. They also assert a "path of responsibility," checking facts, reliable sources, and only sharing content that "made us laugh, inspired us or touched our hearts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

However, this stands in stark contrast to the channel's actual content, which features plagiarized material, unsubstantiated claims, and dark themes like suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

### Job Listings and [[Fair use and copyright issues on YouTube | Copyright Infringement]]

Job listings for Bright Side freelance writers reveal unusual requirements, such as needing to have followed and read Bright Side for over two months, finding it joyful daily, and being an "intelligent and kind person who knows how it feels to love someone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The company also features a "very flushed out copyright infringement notification page," suggesting frequent issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The existence of channels like Bright Side highlights a systemic issue where large corporations, like TheSoul Publishing, exploit YouTube to extract advertiser dollars from the watching habits of children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. This phenomenon is a function of the system and environment that allows for such exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. Addressing these issues requires constructive criticism and an examination of the systems being taken advantage of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

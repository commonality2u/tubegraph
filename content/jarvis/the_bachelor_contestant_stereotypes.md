From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The television show *[[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]]* portrays its contestants in a highly distilled, one-dimensional manner, often reducing them to a single trait or stereotype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This simplification is evident from the initial introductions to the manufactured drama throughout the season, heavily influenced by the [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | role of producers and editing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## One-Dimensional Portrayals

Contestants are frequently introduced with a single defining characteristic, rather than as three-dimensional individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This results in archetypes such as:
*   "Beauty queen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   "Hot Latina from Miami" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> or "Latina Hannah" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
*   "Girl who faked an Australian accent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>
*   "Alabama Hannah" (of which there were two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   The "quirky" contestant who is a "hot dog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   "Super bubbly and outgoing little sassy country girls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>
*   Contestants with "badass backstories," such as one whose mother was in federal prison for embezzlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>

Even the lead, Colton Underwood, was simplified to "hot plus football plus virgin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The show continuously highlights his virginity as a central plot point throughout the season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Strategies for Standing Out

Given the large number of contestants (around 30), many feel compelled to perform "extremely cringy" acts to be remembered by [[narrative_analysis_of_matt_james_as_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Examples include:
*   A contestant introducing herself by saying, "I've popped your cherry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   A woman who remained in a sloth costume for the entire episode, stating that she likes to take things slow, nodding to Colton's virginity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   The "McNutt" contestant who brought a bag of nuts to help Colton remember her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   A contestant who initially faked an Australian accent to appear more interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

These attempts at memorability highlight the competitive nature of the show, where winning is equated to getting married, similar to "the Middle Ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Producer Influence and "Metagaming"

The show's [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | producers]] actively [[producers_role_in_creating_drama_on_the_bachelor | manufacture drama]] and conflict through clever editing and by encouraging contestants to overreact to mundane situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This includes:
*   Arranging conversations where contestants talk about how "hot" [[narrative_analysis_of_matt_james_as_the_bachelor | Colton]] is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   Creating "villain" characters, such as the contestant who brought a dog and talked to Colton four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   Utilizing reshoots and editing techniques (like taking reaction shots and applying them to different situations) to heighten drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

Many contestants engage in "metagaming," where they intentionally act as villains or engage in specific behaviors because they understand it will get them more screen time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The ultimate goal for many is not love or marriage, but rather to grow their personal brand and social media following, which can then be leveraged to advertise products like "appetite suppressant lollipops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. This phenomenon has led to fan communities creating data visualizations of contestants' social media growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Jarvis discusses his disdain for [[discussion_on_the_misguided_overentitlement_in_yelp_reviews | Yelp reviews]], particularly the phenomenon of one-star reviews for national parks, which he finds to be indicative of immense self-importance and entitlement among reviewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:57">[01:54:57]</a>. He argues that such reviews often complain about issues unrelated to the business itself or construct "grand conspiracies" about being targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Unrealistic Expectations for Natural Wonders

### Grand Canyon National Park
The Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona is described as home to immense geological formations showcasing millions of years of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:50">[03:47:50]</a>. However, some [[experiences_with_humorous_and_exaggerated_yelp_reviews | Yelp reviews]] present a stark contrast:
*   **"Jor BP"** described the Grand Canyon as a "giant hole in the ground" caused by erosion, lacking "roller coasters or dippin' dots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:52">[03:59:52]</a>.
*   **"Barry G"** stated, "Oh, I've seen better. Big whoop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:12">[04:22:12]</a>. Jarvis questions what these reviewers gain by seemingly not enjoying such a natural wonder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:24">[04:26:24]</a>. Barry G's taste is further critiqued as he gave a four-star review to an expensive and bad gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:43">[04:35:43]</a>.
*   Another reviewer claimed, "Once you've been to Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon is a joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:10">[05:01:10]</a>. They complained about "no animals, no greenery, no clear blue streams â€“ just a muddy river rock and sheer cliffs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:43">[05:05:43]</a>, highlighting a desire for the Grand Canyon to be like Yellowstone, which it is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. This reviewer then recounted their Yellowstone experiences with buffalo, elk, bald eagles, and even a wolf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:44">[05:20:44]</a>, concluding that the Grand Canyon is "a hole, a very large hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:40">[05:43:40]</a>.

### Yellowstone National Park
Yellowstone National Park is recognized as a nearly 3,500 square mile wilderness recreation area atop a volcanic hotspot, featuring canyons, rivers, forests, hot springs, gushing geysers, and diverse wildlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:24">[05:58:24]</a>. Despite this, one-star reviews exist:
*   One reviewer stated they "hated Yellowstone" because "the problem with the place is that it is dull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   Another noted its "breathtaking and one-of-a-kind beauty" but complained about "terrible traffic and the roads are not in good shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. They also criticized the "little tiny parking lots" at sights like geysers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a> and only seeing some bison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:07:00]</a>, questioning the $30 entry fee for a park with "grass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   A common complaint was the "lack of cell phone service" and expensive Wi-Fi ($12 for 24 hours of slow service), leading one reviewer to joke about wanting to give "zero stars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. Jarvis suggests the lack of service might be "by design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   Another reviewer claimed the park's hot lunch options were worse than school lunches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a> and declared a "hunger strike" until meal variety improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.
*   One reviewer described the experience as being stuck in a "prehistoric world with nothing to do [and] annoying tourists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>, which Jarvis points out could be the reviewer themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

### Glacier National Park
Glacier National Park in Montana also garners "buck wild" reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>:
*   One review from July 2016 warned visitors about a 40 MPH speed limit between Apgar Village and Lake McDonald Lodge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   "Vincennes" stated the park is "great" only if you hike to see the glaciers, but complained about small, clogged turnouts and half the road being closed due to snow in June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. This reviewer then jumped to the conclusion that it was "pretty fishy" and possibly a "UFO" that caused the snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.
*   One of the "worst reviews" seen described Glacier as having "the most number of Rangers who exerted the most control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. The reviewer was upset about "extreme number of rules" enforced by a "large geriatric community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. Complaints included:
    *   His daughter not being allowed to take a rock from the lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.
    *   Restrictions on where they or their dog could go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. Jarvis highlights that it's a national park, "protected ground," and the rules are for preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.
    *   Rangers "reminiscent of the TSA at airports," on a "serious power trip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.
    *   "Extreme control of nature and bears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. Jarvis questions if the reviewer wants to "fight a bear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.
    *   Being "followed and inspected any time we ate at the picnic table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>, claiming they couldn't enjoy it unless allowed to litter, which attracts bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.
    *   Seeing "no animals other than birds and one mountain goat," which had a "huge tracking collar...very artificial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. Jarvis points out trackers are common for animal monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.
    *   Rangers clearing the area from the mountain goat, "ruining that experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>, making Jarvis question if the reviewer wanted to "ride the goat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.
    *   A preference for "any private campground" as "nicer and more natural" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. Jarvis notes that national parks exist to protect land *from* people like this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>.
    *   Concluding that Glacier offers only "postcard views of landscape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a> and if one wants to "experience nature and wildlife," it's "not for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. Despite the one-star review, the reviewer stated they would "drive there again for a day or so" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>.

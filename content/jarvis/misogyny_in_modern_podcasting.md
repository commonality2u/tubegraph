A current "podcasting Renaissance" is characterized by "dudes with terrible opinions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This era sees the rise of podcasts that actively promote misogynistic views, often disguised as discussions on modern dating and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Fresh and Fit Podcast

[[criticism_of_podcasts_like_fresh_and_fit_and_whatever | Fresh and Fit]] is identified as a podcast about "calling women dumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It has "revolutionized the misogyny podcast format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> by bringing on multiple women (up to 10) to talk over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The hosts ask leading questions about promiscuity ("body count") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, giving up Instagram for a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, and whether women's dating standards are realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Women who disagree with the hosts are often kicked off the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The podcast is filmed at night and often features women of color, hosted by two Black men named Myron and Fresh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## The Whatever Podcast

The "Whatever Podcast", hosted by Brian Atlas (who stylizes his name as "Brixton"), is presented as the "exact opposite" of Fresh and Fit in terms of racial representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. It's filmed during the day, features far fewer guests of color, and is described as "gentrifying misogyny podcast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Format and Content

The show's format involves Brian meekly grumbling and looking off-screen for reassurance, contrasting with Fresh and Fit's assertive yelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Brian's co-host is a sex doll named Kiki, whom he introduces as "a bit shy" in every episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The "Whatever" podcast brings on a panel of "entirely too many guests" and asks "incredibly original and hard-hitting questions" such as:
*   "What is your body count?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>
*   "Would you give up Instagram for a man?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
*   "Why are women's standards so high?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>

Despite claiming to be about "modern dating," the show frequently discusses "Traditional Values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Discussions include extended monologues on the male draft and suffering in warfare, often met with "blank stares" from female guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

The show uses hypothetical scenarios like "Would you give up all your personal freedoms for a man who takes out the trash?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, framing women's refusal as "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The context for these scenarios, such as finding a man who doesn't cheat, is presented as occurring in a "magical world," implying its impossibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Underlying Insecurity and Control

The worldview presented on the podcast is rooted in insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The host suggests that if a girlfriend gets attention from other men ("Chads"), the solution is to control her access to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This perspective fundamentally lacks trust in relationships, advocating for "mitigating risk" rather than trusting a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. It is seen as "bananas" to live life by locking a partner in an "anti-chad fortress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

The podcast hosts are described as "transparently sad" and "threatened by a woman's Independence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Brian's own sad stories about going to bars contradict his projections about his partner's social life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The use of a sex doll as a co-host and cutting to sex dolls for reaction shots is seen as transparent [[gender_stereotypes_in_online_content | objectification of women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

Brian's experiences on dating apps like Bumble, where women are required to message first, lead him to conclude that women don't deserve rights because their opening messages were often just "hey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### "Raw Ingredients" and Guests

The podcast features:
*   Brian as the host, with his laptop propped up by books about historical wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   Kiki, the "shy" sex doll, as a co-host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   Guests who are often OnlyFans models or "literal college students" who expect a fun dating show but end up debating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   A recurring "Chase" character, a conservative content creator brought on by Brian to debate his guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. This often devolves into debates between conservative guests and sex workers/college girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Specific guests have included a person who defended domestic abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

The casting call for the podcast describes it as being about "modern dating and relationships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. However, guests who carpool are kicked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Some guests, particularly OnlyFans models, use the show for "good conversion for their platform" despite being shamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Other women actively use the opportunity to "Uno reverse the show and farm them for viral TikTok clips," by debunking the hosts' inconsistent talking points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

### Audience Interaction and Monetization

The live-streamed nature of the show allows for real-time "women hating" in the chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. The chat behavior includes "W man" for men, and "dumb lady," "bad lady," or "304" (a code for "hoe") for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Donations are used to facilitate this, with audience members paying for "evil shit" to be read out loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Brian sometimes laughs at body shaming from the chat or offers "full-throated support" for donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. This creates a community where "lost men are hating on women that they privately seek the approved love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>, or publicly for a significant cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

## Criticism and Impact

The "Whatever Podcast" is critiqued for being boring and having no one, including the hosts, seem to have a good time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Brian is described as the "most reluctant misogyny profiteer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a> and is not seen as genuinely believing his own rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Unlike the [[criticism_of_podcasts_like_fresh_and_fit_and_whatever | Fresh and Fit]] hosts, Brian is considered to lack charisma and is "just flat," even in his attempts to kick guests off the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. His actions, like kicking off multiple guests who arrived together, are seen as technicalities rather than genuine displays of "masculine" strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

The rise of these podcasts highlights a trend where individuals profit from misogynistic content, often without genuine conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Brian's prior history of making prank videos suggests that misogyny podcasts are "the prank videos of the 2020s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. Even the audience of "Whatever" is starting to turn on Brian for "not being masculine enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

The online landscape, particularly platforms like Instagram, is rife with "love and romance themed" content, often targeting teenagers. This content frequently presents [[awful_relationship_memes_on_instagram|moody romance memes]] and narratives that can foster [[misguided_relationship_goals_and_expectations|misguided relationship goals and expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.

## Characteristics of Online Romance Content

These Instagram accounts, such as "pointless existence," "one-sided love for you," and "painful writings," seem primarily aimed at teens due to their "moody" and dramatic tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. The concept of love presented in these memes appears to be derived from pop music lyrics and "bad Disney movies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:10">[01:58:10]</a>.

## Critiquing Relationship Ideals in Memes

### Over-Reliance on a Partner
Many memes suggest that a partner should be the sole focus of one's life, echoing sentiments like: "Missing you is my hobby, caring for you is my job, making you happy is my duty and loving you is my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:56">[02:50:56]</a>. This perspective is critiqued for suggesting a lack of personal hobbies and giving [[mens_insecurity_and_controlling_behavior_in_relationships|control of one's feelings to another person]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>.

### Unhealthy Communication and Intimacy
Conversations depicted in these memes often involve bizarre and potentially unhealthy exchanges, such as:
> "Will you force me to sending nudes?"
> "Yes, I will. But not your body, I want to see your soul naked. I want to know your darkest secrets." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:35">[03:19:35]</a>

Such exchanges are described as "gross" and indicative of poor [[communication_and_miscommunication_in_relationships|communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:34">[03:29:34]</a>.

### [[Jealousy and insecurity in relationships|Jealousy and Insecurity]]
A major recurring theme in these memes is [[jealousy_and_insecurity_in_relationships|jealousy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:40">[04:19:40]</a>. Examples include:
*   "Jealousy when I see you with someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:35">[04:15:35]</a>
*   "Yes, I'm selfish, smirk, because I don't want to share you with anyone else, winky face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:15">[04:40:15]</a>
It is noted that while natural, [[jealousy_and_insecurity_in_relationships|jealousy]] often stems from "inner insecurity" and is generally seen as an "unattractive trait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

### Unrealistic "Relationship Goals"
The concept of "relationship goals" is often presented with unrealistic ideals. While admiring couples like John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, or Jay-Z and Beyonc√©, is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>, some memes propose [[challenging_relationship_dynamics|unhealthy dynamics]] as aspirational:
> "I want a relationship like Tom and Jerry. Fight daily but still can't live without each other." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:11">[06:08:11]</a>
This is ironic given that Tom and Jerry are known for "trying to kill one another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:25">[06:25:25]</a>. Other examples include possessive behavior like telling a partner to "Go get a kiss from that ugly who liked your status on Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:14">[06:54:14]</a>.

### Superficiality and Misconceptions
*   **Misconceptions about love**: The idea that "when you love someone age, distance, height, and weight are just numbers" is presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:10">[07:58:10]</a>. However, this sentiment is often juxtaposed with scenarios where material possessions or superficial facts are prioritized, as seen in a marriage proposal story where a woman judges her suitor based on his car or salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.
*   **[[Misconceptions about women and manipulative behaviors|Misconceptions about women]]**: A meme suggests that "girls usually can't maintain eye contact with the person they love," leading to the "conclusion" that if a girl avoids eye contact or dislikes someone, "she's in love with me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:15">[16:22:15]</a>. This is labeled an unhealthy conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:10">[16:33:10]</a>.
*   **Distorted views on intimacy**: One [[unusual_relationship_stories|unusual story]] depicts losing "virginity through words," where sharing "dark secrets" is equated to sexual intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:10">[15:48:10]</a>.

### Bizarre Pregnancy Narratives
Several memes feature absurd pregnancy scenarios, often with nonsensical dialogue like:
> "I'm pregnant," she said while sleeping. He was happy to hear the good news so he was happy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>
These narratives are criticized for their lack of realism and bizarre plot points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

### [[Critique of online relationship advice|Critique of Online Advice]]
Many accounts also engage in engagement tactics like asking users to comment words "letter by letter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. Furthermore, some accounts feature disclaimers indicating they sell ads and "promote them on our pages" but are not responsible for fraud, suggesting a purely commercial motive behind the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. This highlights the dangers of taking [[criticism_of_tiktok_advice_on_relationships|relationship advice from unfiltered online sources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

## Advice for Teenagers
Given the prevalence of such content, advice is offered to teenagers to navigate life's confusions:
*   Keep your head up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.
*   "No one has it figured out, even the adults that seem like they do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.
*   Value friendships and know your worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.
*   "Don't obsess over things that aren't meant for you right now because something just as good or better could be right around the corner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>.
*   "Things will get better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.

The YouTube channel Troom Troom, with over 20 million subscribers, often features content that is noted for its peculiar and unrealistic scenarios, frequently incorporating strange "life hacks" and characters. These videos, which appear to exist within their own "Troom Troom world," sometimes include [[representation_and_stereotypes_in_video_content | portrayals of characters]] that rely on broad and often inaccurate [[cultural_sensitivity_in_tiktok_videos | cultural stereotypes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Unrealistic Scenarios and Characters

The channel's videos often depict unusual characters and situations, such as a mermaid at a movie theater eating fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The suggested "life hacks" are frequently impractical, like attempting to sneak a comically large hamburger into a movie theater by faking a pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Other bizarre methods include wearing a "snack queen" tiara adorned with cheese and olives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, or using boxing gloves to carry snacks that turn to "dust" from the physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. These unrealistic scenarios sometimes extend to problematic [[gender_stereotypes_in_online_content | portrayals]], such as a woman using burgers for "burger enhancement surgery" to sneak food in and enlarge her chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

## Problematic Cultural Stereotypes

One notable instance of a problematic [[cultural_sensitivity_in_tiktok_videos | cultural stereotype]] appears in a segment featuring a character identified as a "Japanese food lover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This portrayal has been criticized for its "dumb and bad and racist" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Musical and Visual Stereotypes

The segment uses generic "Asian sound" music, described as a "pentatonic scale with some sort of Tycho sounding drum," which contributes to a broad and often inaccurate [[representation_and_stereotypes_in_video_content | generalized Asian aesthetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The character is depicted wearing "sushi earrings" and later appears to put "rice on [her] ears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Inaccurate Cultural Practices

The character's bowing posture is also inaccurate; while [[representation_and_stereotypes_in_video_content | popular media often shows Asian people bowing]] with hands together, Japanese people typically bow with their hands at their sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Another unrealistic depiction is the character taking chopsticks out of her hair to eat, a practice that is both unsanitary and culturally uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. The plastic appearance of the sushi props and the use of actual food as earrings that could hurt the ears further highlight the impracticality and absurdity of the "life hacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### Lack of Cultural Sensitivity in Production

A friend, Mayuko, who is Japanese and a content creator, was invited to comment on the segment. She noted that the character's overall look suggests "zero effort" was put into accuracy, strongly implying that no Asian or Japanese people were involved in the writing or production of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Mayuko described the portrayal as "cringy" and stated that it "doesn't do service to the Japanese weirdness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. This segment, with its reliance on broad [[cultural_sensitivity_in_tiktok_videos | cultural stereotypes]], is viewed as "no longer fun" but "just dumb and bad and racist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Six months after a previous video discussion, the [[123_go_youtube_channel | 123 Go YouTube channel]] has significantly expanded, reportedly doubling in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This growth includes the establishment of multiple new channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## YouTube Trending Page Success

The [[123_go_youtube_channel | 123 Go]] network of channels consistently appears on YouTube's trending page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. On one particular day, three of their videos were simultaneously featured on the trending page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The hosts sarcastically noted that the trending page is known for "the best stuff on YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Channel Expansion and Content Overview

Initially described as a channel featuring "pranks and challenges and fun times with your friends and life hacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, the content style is characterized as a "translated into every language straight back again" version of these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The original "og go channel" includes:
*   Pranks and tricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
*   Girly hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

New channels launched by the [[123_go_youtube_channel | 123 Go]] entity include:

### 123 Go Challenge
This channel focuses on challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### 123 Go Play
Despite only having two videos at the time of analysis, both videos on the "123 Go Play" channel had accumulated over 5 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The hosts observed that these videos were "literally the same videos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### 123 Go Gold
This channel features content related to "funny ideas to recycle all toys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. An example observed was instructions on how to turn a teddy bear into a candy hiding spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

The content across these channels often features "full-grown adults that act 11 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a> and common tropes such as "genius lazy cleaning hacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> and "best pranks and funny tricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. The scripts for many of these videos are noted for their similarity, often using trigger phrases like "nothing like a hot shower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a> or "nothing like a bag of carrots to cheer a girl up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Some videos also show randomly reversed shots, possibly to avoid YouTube's detection of duplicate content across channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

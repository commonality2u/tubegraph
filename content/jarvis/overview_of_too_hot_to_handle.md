From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

"Too Hot To Handle" is a Netflix dating show described as having a "twist," similar to [[love_is_blind_show_format_critique | Love Is Blind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Netflix, once a "bastion of original content," has become a producer of traditional media, including dating shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The show is seen as part of Netflix's trend to create views over high-quality programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Premise and Rules
The central premise of "Too Hot To Handle" is to prevent contestants from engaging in sexual touch, specifically kissing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This concept follows a trend of [[critique_of_dating_show_premises | dating show premises]] removing one of the five senses; for instance, [[the_concept_and_criticism_of_love_is_blind_as_a_dating_show | Love Is Blind]] prevents contestants from seeing each other before engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The show questions whether individuals can form deeper, more meaningful connections without sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Contestants are initially unaware of the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. They believe they are on a normal dating show where they can enjoy a summer on a beach and gain Instagram followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Upon arrival, they are given 12 hours without the rules before the twist is revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

The show's "host" is an artificial intelligence named Lana, which resembles an air freshener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Lana monitors the contestants using "military-grade surveillance technology" (implied to be the [[critique_of_reality_tv_and_its_portrayal_of_relationships | reality TV]] camera crew) and secretly gathers personal data before imposing the sex ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. There is also a disembodied narrator who makes cynical comments at the contestants' expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

A $100,000 prize is at stake, but its exact award criteria (to one person, multiple, or a couple) are unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The prize is supposedly awarded to those who show the "most growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Breaking the rules, such as kissing, incurs monetary penalties, with a single kiss costing $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

## Contestants
The show auditions 3,000 people to select ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The initial cast is portrayed as "horny" and "clueless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Many express commitment phobia or a focus on casual sex, leading to questions about their authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Key contestants include:
*   **Chloe (British, 20):** Characterized as "dumb" by the show's narrator and editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Sharron:** Introduced with a focus on his "giant shlong" and a questionable understanding of feminism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Haley (Sorority girl from Florida):** Portrayed as mean, hateful, and having a tattoo in a language she doesn't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. She is also young but labeled "commitment-phobic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Matthew:** Stands out by wearing clothes on the beach and is often called "Jesus" due to his appearance and spiritual claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. He was previously on "America's Next Top Model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Harry (Australian):** Annoying and constantly trying to come up with a catchphrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **David:** A "sensitive soft boy next door" with a chiseled physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Nicole (Irish):** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
*   **Kells ("The Accountant"):** Likes working out and measures his sexual partners by FIFA plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. He is nicknamed "the accountant" because he cares about not losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Rhonda:** Introduced with a "boring" intro but later revealed to have a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Francesca (Canadian):** An Instagram model with 300,000 followers upon joining the show, often compared to a Kardashian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Show Dynamics and Relationships
The main driving force of the show's drama is the relationship between **Harry and Francesca** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. They are the first to break the rules, kissing the morning after learning about the ban, costing the group $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Harry initially blames Francesca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. In retaliation, Francesca conspires with Haley to waste more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Despite the conflict, Harry and Francesca reconcile and continue to break rules, incurring further penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. They are the only couple from the show who remain together after filming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

**Sharron and Rhonda** also form a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Sharron initially struggles to open up emotionally, leading Rhonda to explore a connection with David, who demonstrates sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Sharron and David resolve their conflict, and Sharron eventually opens up to Rhonda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. They rack up a $16,000 bill from "hanky-panky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. Rhonda later reveals she has a son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.

Other dynamics include **Francesca flirting with Kells** after her initial conflict with Harry, but ultimately returning to Harry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

## Workshops and "Growth"
The show includes "workshops" designed to aid contestants in their "personal journey" and foster "growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. One such workshop involves Shibari, a Japanese form of bondage, which is humorously suggested to help people bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. The show frames the experience as "sexual rehabilitation," but the brevity of the filming period (one month) raises questions about the depth of genuine transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## Editing and Production Critique
The show's pacing is erratic, with concepts and rules introduced at random times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. As a result, the audience may feel disoriented and focus on the "pretty people making kissy kissy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. There is a lack of clarity regarding the passage of time within the show's narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

Editing is described as random, with scenes starting without context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. Talking head sequences sometimes leave contestants in awkward silence, and the narrator's jokes often come at the contestants' expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. Extensive B-roll footage of contestants partying and posing for the camera contributes to the show feeling less genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. The overall production suggests a forced structure in post-production due to a lack of a strong initial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

## Eliminations and New Arrivals
Haley is eliminated from the show, but this event is revealed via a flashback in a later episode, making the timing confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. In episode six of eight, three new contestants (Lydia, Corry, and Madison) are introduced, making it difficult for the audience to become invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Corry and Madison are later eliminated without clear explanation, with Lana stating they didn't "grow enough," despite their limited time on the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

## Resolution and Prize
At the end of the show, $50,000 of the original prize money remains, with most of the losses incurred by Francesca and Harry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. They are given a final challenge to win back half of their lost money by spending a night together without engaging in sexual activity, which they succeed at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

The show concludes with $75,000 in the prize pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. Surprisingly, **everyone wins**, and the money is split among all remaining contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. This results in each person receiving approximately $7,000 (around $16/hour for the filmed month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

## Critique of Outcome
The outcome is criticized for not rewarding those who followed the rules (like Kells, who didn't lose a single dime) any differently from those who broke them frequently (like Francesca) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. It's suggested that the show rewards individuals for taking resources meant for the group and using them for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. Those who engaged in physical connections (Francesca and Harry) left the show in a relationship, while those who abstained did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. The show's emphasis on "growth" is questioned given the short duration of filming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

Ultimately, while the show is viewed as "trash TV" and enjoyable to watch and make fun of, it's implied that it was designed with this purpose in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Shows
The show is compared to [[the_concept_and_criticism_of_love_is_blind_as_a_dating_show | Love Is Blind]] due to its "twist" format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The concept of filtering potential mates by removing a sense is explicitly linked to [[comparison_with_other_dating_shows_like_the_bachelor | other dating shows]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The general premise of dating shows in 2020, focusing on the difficulty of forming genuine relationships due to dating apps, is also noted as a common theme across [[critique_of_dating_show_premises | dating show premises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The narrator's disembodied voice is noted as being similar to "The Circle," both part of Netflix's "reality show starter kit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

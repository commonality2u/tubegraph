Navigating the internet for cooking recipes can be a challenge, according to one narrator who ironically states he found "no results" for recipes online before discovering [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | TikTok]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | TikTok]] is presented as a platform offering food instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This article explores several cooking "hacks" or recipes found on the platform, alongside [[commentary_on_tiktok_trends | commentary on TikTok trends]] and their practicality.

## Getty's "Spaghetti in Ground Beef" with Nerds

The first cook featured is named Getty, from the [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | TikTok]] account "GettyShow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Getty is noted for being a Guinness World Record-holding hula hooper rather than a chef, which the narrator suggests makes her recipes "all the more impressive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Her unique dish involves wrapping raw spaghetti in ground beef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The spaghetti remains uncooked during the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Additional ingredients include bell peppers, onion, and a Bulgarian spice called "chubrica" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The most surprising ingredient is Nerds candy, which Getty claims will "release the sugars" for sweetness and soften the dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The narrator observes the final product "looks like you put Nerds on hamburger spaghetti" and doesn't appear appetizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Getty's "Flaming Hot Cheeto Mac and Cheese"

Another creation by Getty is her "patented Flamin Hot Cheeto mac and cheese," although the narrator clarifies it's not actually patented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This recipe involves boiling Flamin Hot Cheetos in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, including those with lime for "a hint of lime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The boiling process turns the Cheetos into a "foul" smelling, lumpy, bright red mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, which then has mac and cheese noodles added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Despite the mac and cheese already containing cheese, more cheese is added to the Cheeto mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The narrator attempts to replicate this "flaming hot soup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, finding the smell "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> and the final product tasting like "nothing" with no "kick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Strawberry Slicing with a Razor Blade

Getty also presents a "food hack" for slicing strawberries using a razor blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The concept involves embedding a razor blade into one strawberry, placing it in a bowl with other whole strawberries, and shaking the bowl vigorously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. The blade is supposed to ricochet and slice all the strawberries "magically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

The narrator deems this a "cap" (a lie) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, noting it is dangerous and "stressful" to toss a razor blade around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. He attempts the hack, despite warnings not to try it at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. After shaking the strawberries for a minute, they remain uncut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, and the razor blade is found stuck to the top of the container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The narrator humorously concludes that using a knife would be "cleaner and faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a> and questions the safety of having to wonder if all blades were removed before eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

## Omelette in a Lay's Bag

Another [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | TikTok]] food hack involves dropping a raw egg into a bag of Lay's potato chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, then pouring the egg mixture (with chips inside) into the bag and boiling the entire bag in water to cook the omelette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

The narrator expresses disgust at the "slop" of the raw omelette being poured into the chip bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. He questions what happened to the chips initially in the bag and if they are part of the omelette, making it a "greasy potato chip omelette" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The final product is unseasoned, relying only on the salt from the chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Concerns are raised about boiling a Lay's bag and potential unhealthy chemicals leaching into the egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## Mashed Potatoes from Chip Bag

This hack involves boiling a bag of Frito-Lay potato chips in water to create mashed potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. The creator claims it's a way to avoid cutting oneself while peeling potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

The narrator finds the sight of potatoes violently slipping in the bag "gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The resulting consistency is described as "oatmeal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. After straining the "wet bunch of potato chips" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>, garlic sauce, pepper, and butter are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The narrator finds this "disgusting" and "appalled," suggesting one was "already done" before adding the "extra step" of soaking chips in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. He questions who this hack is for, noting the inhumane methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

## Whipped Coffee

A widely [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | viral food hack]] from [[tiktok_pranks_and_trends | TikTok]] is "whipped coffee," which involves mixing coffee, sugar, and water, then whisking for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. The narrator spends over half an hour whisking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a> until a thick whipped consistency is achieved.

The whipped coffee is then mixed into a cup of milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, which the narrator finds defeats the purpose of the extensive whipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. He feels it simply adds "manual labor for the same results" as making regular iced coffee with milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. While the taste is "not bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>, he believes the same thing could have been made in ten seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

Overall, the journey through these [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | TikTok]] cooking hacks leaves the narrator's kitchen a mess, with little to show for it other than a "bottle of liquid Cheetos" that later solidified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

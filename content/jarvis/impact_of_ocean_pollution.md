Ocean pollution is a significant concern, with millions of pounds of waste accumulating in the world's oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This waste harms the ocean, which is home to various marine life, including mythical creatures like mermaids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## [[Team Seas initiative | Team Seas Initiative]]

To address this issue, the [[Team Seas initiative | Team Seas initiative]] was launched by Mr. Beast and Mark Rober <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The initiative aims to raise $30 million and remove 30 million pounds of waste from the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### How to Contribute

The public can contribute to the [[Team Seas initiative | Team Seas initiative]] by donating at teamseas.org <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For every dollar donated, one pound of waste is removed from the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Even a single dollar can make a significant difference in waste removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The goal is to clean up the seas, potentially encouraging sirens and mermaids to interact with humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

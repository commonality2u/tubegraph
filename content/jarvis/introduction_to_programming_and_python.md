Many individuals interested in software engineering, programming, or computer science often inquire about how to begin their journey in these fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. One common starting point within a [[computer_science_degree_curriculum | college degree]] is an introductory computing course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## CS 1301: Introduction to Computing

A foundational course for those new to the field is often titled "CS 1301 Intro to Computing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This class is designed to provide an [[introduction_to_programming_for_beginners | introduction to programming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Learning Python

A common language taught in such introductory courses is [[python_programming_basics | Python]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Students learn to program using Python, sometimes in conjunction with physical tools like "scribbler" robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Practical Application

As a final project in an introductory programming class, students might be tasked with developing a script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. An example of an [[application_of_programming_in_everyday_tasks | application of programming]] could be creating a script to scrape lyrics from online websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. These early projects can sometimes evoke a sense of cringe when revisited years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

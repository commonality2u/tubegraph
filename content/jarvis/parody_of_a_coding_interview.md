This article details a satirical take on the typical software engineering interview process, highlighting common absurdities and frustrations faced by candidates. The parody features an interviewer named Travis, a "senior software engineer" at "social media website.com," who exhibits an inflated sense of self-importance and conducts a highly unconventional interview.

## The Interviewer: Travis
Travis, who claims to be a "senior software engineer" with at least a year and a half of industry experience, immediately asserts his "clout" and importance within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Despite working on the "ads team" which supposedly uses machine learning to "revolutionize" ad buying and selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, Travis admits his actual work primarily involves building analytics dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. He maintains that his work is "integral" to the whole operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Travis rushes the interview, stating they only have 30 minutes and that he is "pretty swamped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## The "Tell Me About Yourself" Question
When asked to "tell me a little bit about yourself," the interviewer confesses that he asks this question merely "to feign a natural human interaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. He reveals he already knows "pretty much everything" about the candidate, including their work, interests, and personal life, gathered from "social media website.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This highlights a critique of data collection practices by social media companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## The Coding Challenge
The interview transitions to a coding exercise on "coder Pat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The problem presented to the candidate is highly unusual and complex, involving managing "several hundred payments" to the IRS with different due dates and accruing interest, all while trying to "avoid going to jail" until a startup's IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The interviewer penalizes the candidate for attempting to draw a diagram for their solution instead of immediately writing code, stating it's "far easier" to think about problems without staring at a blinking cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This behavior is explained by the interviewer's focus on "evaluating you against the expectations of this esoteric exercise" rather than the candidate's actual job suitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This parodies [[challenges_in_tech_job_interviews | challenges in tech job interviews]] and [[misleading_software_engineering_advice | misleading software engineering advice]] common in the industry.

## Candidate's Questions and Realities
When the candidate asks about the cost of living in the Bay Area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, Travis dismisses the concern by mentioning a "very generous" private equity package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. However, he clarifies that this only matters if the company goes public, comparing it to a "lottery ticket" where the outcome is known in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. When pressed about comfortable living *now*, Travis reveals he "live[s] in my car on the company campus" due to free parking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

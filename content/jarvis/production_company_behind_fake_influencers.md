A specific genre on TikTok involves [[fictional_influencers_on_tiktok | fictional influencers]], who are characters literally written by a team of writers pretending to be influencers, but who do not exist in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This contrasts with typical influencers who may perform a life that is not entirely true to how they actually live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Forefront: The Production Company

A production company named Forefront is responsible for nearly all of the main [[fictional_influencers_on_tiktok | fictional influencers]] on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This information was revealed in a Vox article by Rebecca Jennings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Forefront manages 22 fake influencer stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> and aims to build a "Marvel Cinematic Universe" of fake people and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The company was founded by a USC screenwriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> and takes a "TV pilot approach," where some stories succeed and some fail, with the goal of building a larger connected narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Characteristics of Forefront's Influencers
*   **Fictional Disclaimer**: Many of these TikTokers state in their bios that they are fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. However, this disclosure is often placed subtly, like "50 spicy 50 sweet 100 fictional" in a profile bio, which can be easily missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Acting and Writing Quality**: The videos often feature "some of the worst acting" and "worst writing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, which appears to be intentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Audience Engagement**: Comment sections often play into the fictional world, with users either "in on it" or genuinely fooled because the videos appeared on their "For You Page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Storylines**: The stories are often convoluted and dramatic, resembling a soap opera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. They involve complex plot twists, character crossovers, and often unfold across multiple accounts and live streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

## Ethical Concerns and Impact on Audiences

A significant concern highlighted is that it's not always clear if the audience understands that these stories are fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. For example, a character named Sydney, who "works for a dating app" in her fictional world, posted a TikTok offering dating advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This video went viral and was picked up by online publications and even the New York Post, without mentioning that Sydney or her advice were fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

This raises questions about the [[impact_of_fictional_influencers_on_audiences | impact of fictional influencers on audiences]], as many viewers might assume the content is real, especially when scrolling through their "For You Page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. While the content in this specific example might be harmless, the overall practice is seen as dishonest and an "ethical gray area" because viewers don't know the content is written by a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The nature of TikTok's algorithm means new viewers may not realize the "fake soap opera influencer TikTok" genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, and the companies benefit from initial engagement by users who believe the stories are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.

## Notable Fictional Influencers Under Forefront

*   **Butler Darren**: Purports to be the personal assistant of a billionaire, engaging in various "hijinks" and dramatic storylines, such as having an affair with his boss's girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. His boss is later revealed as "Mr. Butts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Much Joy**: Described as the fictional daughter of the billionaire Butler Darren works for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Her storylines include having an identical twin and her grandmother stealing her boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Sydney**: A character who claims to work customer support for an unnamed dating app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Her story arc includes living in her sister's shadow, working for minimum wage, and uncovering her sister's fiance's cheating through her "job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. This leads to her sister kicking her out, and Sydney then finding a new roommate in the mistress of her sister's ex-fiance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Her storyline eventually crosses over with Butler Darren's universe when she competes to win the billionaire Mr. Butts' estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

This approach of creating and connecting [[fictional_influencers_on_tiktok | fictional influencers]] is part of a broader trend of scripted, often exaggerated, online content, similar in concept to [[the_fake_nature_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | the fake nature of the YouTube channel Actually Happened]] and the [[proliferation_of_fake_animated_story_channels_on_youtube | proliferation of fake animated story channels on YouTube]].

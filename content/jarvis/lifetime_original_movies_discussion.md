Lifetime partnered with KFC to produce an original movie titled *A Recipe for Seduction* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This collaboration was described as "the weirdest brand deal of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The movie's poster went viral, sparking widespread discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The film serves as an origin story for Colonel Sanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, though the core motivation behind its creation was to "sell chicken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The idea for the movie was initially to make a "horny movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, with the reasoning that "Colonel Sanders is hot now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Despite its unusual premise, the movie was actually produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

It is revealed that *A Recipe for Seduction* is indeed a Christmas movie, opening with giant Christmas trees and taking place during the holiday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The film is characterized by a high budget for what is essentially a commercial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, and features dramatic, soap-opera-like plot twists, including a secret romantic relationship between the villain and the protagonist's mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

Despite its commercial nature, the movie was successful in generating buzz and becoming a topic of conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

> "Honestly, this was a successful marketing ploy because not only am I talking about it but everybody was like, 'What the hell is this?' So we're we're talking about KFC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>

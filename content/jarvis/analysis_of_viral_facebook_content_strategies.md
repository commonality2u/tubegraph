[[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | Fabiosa Better World]], a prominent internet content farm, generates content that appears to be designed by artificial intelligence with the specific task of creating [[influence_of_viral_content_and_clickbait | viral Facebook content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Their content spans various formats, including life hacks and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Content Portfolio

Fabiosa's content often features outlandish and sensationalized scenarios, exemplified by titles like "Dad left me in an earthquake to run off with his lover" or "Ladies can't fix cars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### "Life Hack" Videos

Despite being labeled "life hacks," these videos often present complex, full-scale DIY projects rather than simple shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For instance, viewers are shown how to transform an unwanted aluminum sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, a washing machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, or even a microwave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> into a barbecue grill, requiring extensive work, including sawing and welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The overarching theme suggests that Fabiosa aims to create "a better world... where everything is a grill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### "Stories" â€“ Bizarre Narratives and Emotional Manipulation

Fabiosa's "stories" often lack a coherent narrative structure, resembling dream sequences where events transition oddly without clear progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. These stories are characterized by extreme situations and bizarre plot points:

*   **Extreme Scenarios**: One story, "My mom-in-law gave me a concrete bath on my wedding day," depicts attempted murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Another involves a mother-in-law trying to trap someone in a stove, encase them in rock, or seal them in concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Rapid Pacing and Lack of Explanation**: Events unfold at an alarming rate, with significant plot points, like a bride being nearly encased in concrete, receiving only two seconds of attention before moving on to a "makeover" involving fish tanks and watermelon rinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Character Backstories**: Characters are frequently given ridiculously tragic or challenging backstories, such as having a sick daughter in the hospital and appendicitis, seemingly to evoke immediate emotional responses from viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This tactic is considered a form of emotional manipulation due to its deliberate nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Themes of Triumph Over Adversity**: Many stories, like "Women are made for washing dishes," follow a common trope: an underestimated individual, often a woman, proves their capabilities against sexist assumptions in the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. However, even these narratives can deliver questionable morals, suggesting one should sacrifice their own needs for those who harass them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **"Disheveled Person Gets Cleaned Up" Genre**: A recurring theme involves a "disheveled person gets cleaned up good and now they're accepted by society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## Strategy Behind Viral Content

These strategies are clearly visible across different platforms, with longer versions of stories appearing on Facebook and YouTube, while shorter, fast-paced versions are found on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The core approach appears to prioritize immediate engagement and shock value over logical consistency or realistic storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The constant use of extreme scenarios and melodramatic backstories suggests an attempt to generate strong emotional reactions and maximize shareability, fitting into broader [[influence_of_viral_content_and_clickbait | viral content and clickbait]] patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This aligns with [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing strategies and viral trends in social media]] that leverage bizarre or emotionally charged narratives to capture attention quickly.

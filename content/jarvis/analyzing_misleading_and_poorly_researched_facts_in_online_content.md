Online platforms host a vast amount of content, but not all of it is accurate or well-researched. One example of a channel that exemplifies this issue is "Facts Verse", which produces list videos and news stories often containing misleading or incorrect information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:30">[01:54:30]</a>.

## Facts Verse: A Case Study

"Facts Verse" is a YouTube channel with approximately 5 million subscribers and 2 million subscribers on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>. The channel's videos often feature sensationalist titles like "15 everyday things you've been doing wrong" or "10 horse breeds that you will not believe exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:27">[01:40:27]</a>.

### Characteristics of Misleading Content

The "facts" presented on "Facts Verse" range significantly in their accuracy:
*   **Opinion Presented as Fact**: Some statements are subjective opinions, such as how to prepare a taco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.
*   **Incorrect Information**: The channel frequently presents demonstrably false claims, such as the incorrect spelling of "tyres" (tires) in a text overlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:13">[05:39:13]</a> or the claim that the Pepsi logo spells "is dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **Potentially Harmful Advice**: One video suggests plugging a flash drive into a phone charger or connecting found USB drives from walls into a laptop, which could lead to a virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Poorly Researched and Grammatically Incorrect**: Many of the channel's "facts" appear to be sourced from subreddits like "Today I Learned" or "WTF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:07">[06:26:07]</a> and often feature grammatical errors or awkward phrasing, such as "studies has shown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:47">[05:42:47]</a> or "he is only reason behind a famous connection of iPhone and kidney" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:06">[06:01:06]</a>.
*   **Grotesque and Triggering Topics**: The channel also features thumbnails and topics that are considered grotesque or triggering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Content Sourcing and Business Model

"Facts Verse" states its primary goal is to "educate and entertain" its fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:44">[04:28:44]</a>. However, the channel's content often appears to be unoriginal, leading to concerns about [[Critique of Content Farms | content farms]] and copyright. A copyright message is present in nearly every video description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

Examples of content found elsewhere:
*   The "10 things you did not know what they are" video features a list identical to one found on Bright Side's website, suggesting direct theft of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. This same list was also found on Cat Fly.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:56">[09:35:56]</a>.
*   The "Photos to test your intelligence" video uses images and concepts found in a Life Buzz article, another [[Critique of Content Farms | content farm]] blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.
*   A video titled "18 awful lies around daily use objects" appears to be directly copied from a BuzzFeed list, which itself pulled content from Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.

### Specific Examples of Misleading Videos

#### "10 things you did not know what they are"
This video attempts to explain the purpose of the loop on the back of a shirt.
*   It correctly identifies one purpose (to hang the shirt on a hook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.
*   It incorrectly states that hanging a shirt by the loop will cause wrinkles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
*   It vaguely mentions a second purpose related to fastening a tie without explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
*   It proposes a "romantic" third purpose, claiming American university students removed the loop when dating exclusively, a claim that is presented as a definitive purpose rather than a rare anecdotal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

#### "10 Pokemon that actually exists in real life"
This video demonstrates a lack of knowledge about the subject matter.
*   **Drowsy**: Described as "mysterious" and "scary" but "actually very" without completing the thought, and ambiguously stated to "help put others to sleep from time to time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.
*   **Magikarp**: Stated that "to transform Magikarp into something that is useful you would need to catch thousands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>, which is inaccurate in the context of Pok√©mon mechanics.
*   **Victreebel**: The description of its attack and defense levels, and its "normal happiness level," makes little to no sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
*   **Bulbasaur**: Incorrectly identified as a reptile inspired by a frog, when frogs are amphibians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. It also incorrectly states Bulbasaur "traveled to Mario Smash Brothers" instead of Super Smash Bros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

#### "Photos to test your intelligence"
This video, a spot-the-difference game, features incomplete or incorrect answers and a condescending tone.
*   For the first image, only one difference (a mouse hole) is identified, implying it's the only one, when there are more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.
*   For an image featuring a clock tower and double-decker bus, the channel incorrectly identifies the city as Tokyo, Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>, when the elements clearly indicate London. It also misses several differences, including numbers on the bus and a pedestrian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.
*   For another image, the video identifies only one difference out of nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>, while simultaneously being condescending about the viewer's intelligence if they missed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. This deliberate misdirection could be seen as a test of whether viewers accept random YouTube content as fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

"Facts Verse" exemplifies many issues with online content, including the proliferation of poorly researched and misleading facts. While the channel performs some work like editing and scripting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>, its frequent reliance on unoriginal, often stolen content, and its monetization of other people's intellectual property, raises significant concerns about content quality and ethics in online media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>.

The stability of software engineering jobs during economic downturns, such as a market crash, is a common concern among those in or considering the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Business Insider's Tips for Job Retention During a Market Crash

Business Insider published "seventeen tips on how to keep your software engineering job even during a market crash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Some of the advice provided includes:

*   **Work in a Stable Area**
    > "Work in an area where even a mediocre engineer can have stability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    This advice is sarcastically interpreted as lowering the bar and not having self-respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

*   **Salary Considerations**
    > "Sometimes not having a high salary helps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
    This is critiqued with the notion that "you can't lose money in the market crash if you didn't make any money in the first place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

*   **Demonstrate Dedication**
    The article suggests showing "true [[the_role_of_passion_and_dedication_in_software_engineering|dedication]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

*   **Interview Performance**
    Another tip is to "interview well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, which is paraphrased as "just don't be bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This advice is deemed unhelpful for someone struggling with interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

*   **Choose a Recession-Proof Industry**
    The article advises working in a "recession-proof industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

*   **Build a Personal Brand**
    A tip is to "build a personal brand outside your company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

The advice from Business Insider is generally regarded as "ridiculous" and lacking practical utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

The **Team Seas initiative** is a fundraising campaign aimed at environmental cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Origin and Goals

The initiative was started by Mr. Beast and Mark Rober <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Its primary goal is to raise 30 million dollars and remove 30 million pounds of waste from the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. For every dollar donated, one pound of waste is removed from the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Promoting the Initiative

The video's host, Jarfish Johnson, expresses excitement about being part of the initiative after Mr. Beast personally asked him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. To raise awareness about protecting the ocean, the host uses the topic of [[mermaid_sightings_and_tiktok | mermaid sightings and TikTok]] as a creative way to engage viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Viewers are encouraged to donate at teamseas.org if they feel inspired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The host repeatedly emphasizes that donations, even a single dollar, contribute significantly to removing [[impact_of_ocean_pollution | waste from the ocean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

The connection between [[mermaid_sightings_and_tiktok | mermaid sightings and TikTok]] and the [[promotion_of_team_trees_and_its_mission | Team Seas mission]] is framed as a way to engage interest in the ocean's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The host humorously suggests that cleaning up the sea might encourage sirens and mermaids to interact with humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## Connection to Ocean Life

The motivation behind promoting Team Seas is the protection of the ocean, which is the home of marine life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The initiative aims to address the millions of pounds of [[impact_of_ocean_pollution | waste in our oceans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

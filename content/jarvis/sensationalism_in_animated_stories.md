[[Sensationalism in digital storytelling | Sensationalism in digital storytelling]] has become a pervasive element within animated story channels on platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These channels often feature content that is described as "awful," "sensational," "inappropriate," and "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Characteristics of Sensationalist Animated Stories

Animated story channels frequently employ specific tactics to attract viewers, often at the expense of quality and truthfulness:
*   **Cheap Animation and Voiceovers** The videos are animated cheaply and typically voiced by a fluent English speaker reading a script written by someone for whom English is not their first language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **False Claims of Authenticity** Many stories are presented as true experiences, with phrases like "these stories are true" or "happened to me for real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Extreme and Varied Topics** The subjects covered range from "horrible things," "rare things," to a combination of "horrible and rare things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **[[Plagiarism in animated stories | Plagiarism]] and Logistical Errors** Nearly all stories are stolen from popular media or literally plagiarized from sources like Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. They are often "riddled with logistical errors that make them provably untrue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The phenomenon of channels copying metadata from each other also points to widespread [[plagiarism_in_animated_stories | plagiarism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Repetitive Content Across Channels** Despite the large number of channels, their content is often identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For example, the story "my dad as a deputy" appeared on four different channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Celebrity Impersonation** Channels like "Actually Happened" have told life stories of celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jackie Chan, implying collaboration that "definitely didn't happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. They also feature sensationalized celebrity stories, like "I'm Billy Eilish and I'm a bad guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Engagement Tactics** Some channels attempt to engage with their audience through community tabs, posting strange content like pets telling their crazy stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Others post "emo community posts" complaining about YouTube cutting their view counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Examples of Sensationalist Narratives

The content of these channels is characterized by its extreme and often inappropriate nature, frequently targeting young viewers.
*   "I grew up in an average family... until my father died" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   "I got pregnant at 12" was a video from "My Story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   "I married a 94 year old grandpa when I was just sixteen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   "I call it a one-in-a-billion disease and now I'm a genius" involved a protagonist who drank a mysterious liquid from the trash, which supposedly gave him a "rare disease" enabling him to convince anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   "I got suspended for being too pretty" depicted a girl bullied for her looks and later framed for vandalism, then passed over for a bonus due to her female boss's jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The story concludes with her hope that her looks will help her get a new job from a male interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   "I got pregnant from swimming with my friends" was revealed to be about a girl who kissed her crush and incorrectly thought she was pregnant, a single sentence idea stretched to 14 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
*   "My stepmom chest ripped my family apart" detailed a protagonist abandoned by her mother, living with an abusive stepmother, and later nearly having her kidney stolen by a "kidney bandit," before gaining control over rats to terrorize her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

## [[Critique of fake animated stories | Critique of Fake Animated Stories]]

There is significant [[criticism_of_fake_animated_stories_on_youtube | criticism of fake animated stories on YouTube]] for their irresponsible content and misleading nature.

### [[Impact of Sensationalist Content on Children | Impact of Sensationalist Content on Children]]
Content creators are urged to have "some responsibility" when telling stories, even if they are presented as "kid's stories," as some topics are "inappropriate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The narratives often include themes that are not suitable for young viewers, despite being presented as "kid's content."

### Misleading Categorization
Despite their highly fictional and often inappropriate content, these videos are frequently classified under the "education" category on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This raises questions regarding YouTube's content guidelines, especially concerning children's content and regulations like COPPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.

### Proliferation of Channels
Despite increased [[critique_of_animated_story_channels | criticism of animated story channels]] and scrutiny, these channels are multiplying at an alarming rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The ease of creation and apparent profitability contribute to their rapid increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The number of such channels has reportedly grown significantly, from around six to 27 in a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

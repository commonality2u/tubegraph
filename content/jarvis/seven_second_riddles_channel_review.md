From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The YouTube channel *Seven Second Riddles* is produced by the creators of Five-Minute Crafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Despite initial reluctance to cover more content from this creator, *Seven Second Riddles* became a highly requested topic for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The content raises questions about its intended audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, with the overall impression being that the content is "bad" for reasons not immediately obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Content Style and Frequency

*Seven Second Riddles* posts content frequently, with approximately five new videos daily, which is described as absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Titles and Thumbnails

The channel employs sensationalist titles and thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:
*   **IQ Claims** Titles often claim to boost IQ or suggest that only "geniuses" or the "top 1%" can solve the riddles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Irrelevant Clickbait** Titles are frequently "weird," "completely unrelated," and designed as clickbait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Examples include "only the X-Men can solve this thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> or "only people with good relationships with their fathers can pass this quiz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Salacious Questions** Thumbnails feature cartoon scenes posing "salacious questions" like "who's telling the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, "who killed the math teacher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, or "which maid is a man who killed the maid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Riddle Themes

The riddles themselves are characterized as "dark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, with narratives often centered around themes of crime, death, lying, cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, and even "being poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This contrasts with the apparent target demographic, as the content often seems intended for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The channel describes itself as "the place for the best riddles and answers in the world," catering to both "riddle wizards or a noob" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Examples of Riddles and Critique

The review highlights several examples of riddles and their perceived flaws:
*   **"Sixteen Brain Teasers That'll Turn Your Brain On"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
    *   One riddle asks to identify the poor person based on a cartoon image of several individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The provided answer, identifying someone with a watch (possibly a smartwatch) as "not poor," is deemed problematic and illogical, as homeless individuals can own such devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The question itself is criticized for implying that any of the characters couldn't be poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   Another riddle about identifying a rich person from a group is based on a character wearing a necklace with "blue things on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, or a character playing a Stradivarius violin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **"Who Killed the Dog?"** This riddle features an unnecessarily intense music score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> and a detailed, poorly written narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. There is no voice-over for the riddles, unlike similar channels such as [[Critique of Bright Side YouTube Channel | Bright Side]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The scenario involves family members, and the solution implies that one of them murdered the dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Luxury Party Theft Riddle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> This riddle involves a necklace theft during a power outage at a luxury party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Suspect alibis are presented, with the solution based on the implausibility of a ventilator disappearing when the lights turn out, implying the suspect was lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Emoji/Image-Based Word Puzzles**
    *   Guessing brands from emojis (e.g., Pumbaa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    *   Guessing a word from images including a homeless man on a laptop, garbage, and a beat-up truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The implied answer "trash" to describe the homeless man is deemed offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Old Man's Death Riddle** This riddle features unsettling music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> and a graphic depiction of a dead old man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. The solution identifies the mailman as the killer because he knew the old man wouldn't need a newspaper on certain days, implying foreknowledge of his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Public Bath Murder Riddle** A riddle where one friend is murdered in a public bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. The solution identifies a friend as the killer based on him bringing a thermos, implying it concealed a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Critique and Harmful Implications

The primary concern with *Seven Second Riddles* and similar channels like Facts Verse and [[Critique of Bright Side YouTube Channel | Bright Side]] is their hyper-sensationalist content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This approach is considered potentially harmful to young viewers due to the **availability heuristic** and **negativity bias** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

*   **Availability Heuristic** This cognitive bias leads people to believe that events are more likely if they have more examples of them readily available in their memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. For example, people might fear plane crashes more than car crashes because plane crashes receive more news coverage, despite cars being statistically more dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Negativity Bias** Humans are naturally more attracted to unpleasant things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

When combined with the YouTube algorithm, these biases can manipulate a viewer's sense of reality, making the world appear bleaker than it truly is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The cartoon format of these videos further amplifies this effect by appealing more to a younger audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Creating entire channels focused on murder and negative events is seen as exploitative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, as it can cause an exaggerated fear of negative occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

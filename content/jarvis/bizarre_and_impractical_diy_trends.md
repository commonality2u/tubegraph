Recent online trends have featured bizarre and often impractical DIY "life hacks" designed primarily for virality and "outrage clicks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. These videos, often originating from sources like the "Magic Show" on Snapchat (founded by Rick Lax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, involve using everyday items for unintended and often unsanitary purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Many of these trends are connected to a broader category of [[life_hacks_and_diy_culture | life hacks and DIY culture]] that emphasize shock value over [[practicality_and_humor_in_diy_life_hacks | practicality]].

## The "Toilet Lady" (Anna Show)

A prominent figure in these trends, known as "the toilet lady" or "the Anna Show," consistently creates content involving toilets for non-toilet purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. She has gained significant traction on platforms like TikTok and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

### Toilet Punch Hack

One of the initial videos that gained attention featured making "DIY punch" for parties inside a toilet bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This process involves adding ice, Neapolitan ice cream (or sorbet), and Hawaiian punch directly into the toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The toilet used in the video appeared stained and "bacterial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Despite claims of cleaning the toilet, the imagery alone is considered disgusting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Toilet Hair Wash Hack

Another bizarre use of a toilet involves washing hair in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This hack specifically utilizes the toilet tank to dispense shampoo and conditioner, with the water presumably coming out when flushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The video suggests this is presented as a "magic trick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This "hack" is not [[practicality_and_humor_in_diy_life_hacks | practical]] as it doesn't provide a thorough wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Toilet Milkshake Hack

A third toilet-centric "dessert" hack involves making a milkshake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The process begins by clogging the toilet with a "burrito sandbag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Ingredients like chocolate sauce, whipped cream, milk, and sprinkles are then added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The creator adds whipped cream to make it "extra creamy" due to the "little bit of water mixed in there" (toilet water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. The toilet is clearly not an effective blender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. The visual of people gathering around a toilet to drink from it is presented as the absurd "venue" for such a party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

## Other Impractical Food & Prank Hacks

Beyond toilets, Anna is also involved in other staged and impractical content:

### Ground Beef and Velveeta Creation

This food hack involves molding ground beef around a block of Velveeta cheese, then baking it inside a pre-made Pillsbury biscuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. The final product is described as looking "truly vile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

### Tinder Prank

Anna also creates [[tiktok_pranks_and_trends | TikTok pranks]], such as a video where she goes on a Tinder date and changes her appearance overnight to look "unattractive" (e.g., adding a unibrow) for the morning reveal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. This type of content is criticized for perpetuating "weird ideas about beauty and sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

## Motivation Behind the Trends

These bizarre DIY trends are primarily motivated by generating "outrage clicks and views" and "tons of money" from the resultant engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The content is explicitly created for "virality and clout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. It is asserted that these videos are staged and fake, not genuine daily activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. A significant concern is the excessive [[repurposing_everyday_items_for_unintended_uses | wasting of food]] in the process of creating these gross-out food hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

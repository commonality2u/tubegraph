The "devious licks" trend on TikTok, which involves students stealing items from schools and posting about it, has prompted significant reactions from both school administrations and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This phenomenon, which began around September 6th with a video of a student pulling a hand sanitizer dispenser from a backpack, quickly escalated from petty theft to the removal of larger items and even vandalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

## School Responses

As the trend intensified, schools were forced to implement various measures to curb the damage and disruption caused by the "devious licks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

### Immediate Impacts and Closures
The widespread theft led to immediate operational challenges for schools. Many schools experienced:
*   The closure of bathrooms due to stolen soap dispensers, paper towel dispensers, and even entire sinks or urinals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>. This often meant students had no way to wash their hands or use facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   School homecomings being canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   Some schools returning to online learning due to the severity of the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.

### Official Communications and Disciplinary Actions
Schools commonly issued official statements, often via school-wide emails or morning announcements, to address the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>. These communications typically highlighted:
*   The presence of vandalism in boys' restrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>.
*   The necessity of shutting down facilities for repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.
*   The significant financial burden on the school, draining "valuable resources, time, and money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. This directly relates to the [[effects_of_theft_on_schools | effects of theft on schools]] and could [[public_school_underfunding | exacerbate existing underfunding]] issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.
*   Threats of legal and school action against students involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>.
*   The establishment of anonymous tip lines for students to report damage or theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>.
*   A common challenge noted in these communications was the frequent misspelling of "TikTok" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.

### Appeals to Students
School principals also attempted to appeal to students' sense of responsibility and [[cultural_impact_of_high_school_musical | school spirit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. One principal, for instance, contrasted positive student behavior at a football game with the "disrespectful behavior" in bathrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>. They asked students:
> "what kind of school do you want to attend? Do you want to attend a school where you have school spirit and people are respectful and they're happy to be here or do you want to go to a place where you have to sign in and out of the bathroom to go to the bathroom?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>

However, it is suggested that arguments based on [[high_school_musicals_influence_on_youth_and_popular_culture | school spirit]] may not resonate with the TikTok-posting generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>.

## Teacher Perspectives

Teachers have been significantly impacted by the "devious licks" trend, often bearing the direct consequences of the thefts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

### Direct Impact on Resources
Many teachers reported having essential items stolen from classrooms and bathrooms:
*   Soap dispensers from boys' bathrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.
*   Chromebooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.
*   Personal items like a framed picture of a pre-calc teacher's family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.
*   Teachers often have to supply their own classroom materials, like staples, due to [[public_school_underfunding | underfunding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. The trend further strains these limited budgets, forcing schools to "sink more money into repairing the damages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>.

### Protecting Personal Investments
Some teachers have resorted to protective measures to safeguard their personal investments in the classroom. One middle school teacher stated:
> "I've resorted to keeping my room camera permanently on to ensure none of the books I bought with my own money for students to read get stolen." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>

### Varied Sentiments
Teachers expressed complex feelings about the trend:
*   Some acknowledged a degree of understanding for students' frustration, even admitting to being "pro vandalism in order to cause trouble and stick it to an administration school district that bleeds money to malicious textbook companies and dumb technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. However, this sentiment was balanced by the need to protect their "personal investments" and ensure students could maintain hygiene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.
*   A new math teacher sadly noted that their "underfunded" classes had "no devious licks to hit" because there was nothing of value to steal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.
*   Teachers faced the challenge of maintaining authority while wanting to be seen as "cool," as one teacher described after asking a student to return a stolen soap dispenser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.

The "devious licks" trend created a chaotic environment in schools, forcing administrators and teachers to react to widespread theft and vandalism, impacting school operations and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

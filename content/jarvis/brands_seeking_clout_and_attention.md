## Introduction to Brands on Social Media
[[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | Brands]] have become an inescapable presence across various social media platforms, extending beyond just Twitter to the internet at large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Their omnipresence means consumers must simply live with their antics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Pursuit of Clout and Attention
Brands actively seek "clout" and attention, often engaging in unexpected ways to gain visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This drive for attention can lead to bizarre and absurd behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Brands Responding to Creators
When a content creator announced a video about [[strategies_of_fastfood_brands_on_twitter | brand Twitter]], numerous brands directly replied to the tweet, asking to be featured in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This phenomenon was likened to "little birds feeding from my clout breadcrumbs," indicating their eagerness for free advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Brands like Zaxby's displayed a "thirst for clout," seeking to be "quenched" with exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The creator noted that giving them attention served their point of wanting free advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Normalization of Absurdity
The absurd and weird behavior of brands has become normalized, leading to a general acceptance from the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This acceptance suggests that a major [[brands_as_people_marketing_strategy | marketing strategy]] to transform brands into relatable entities has been successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## [[the_humanization_and_personification_of_brands | Humanization and Personification of Brands]]
A significant [[brands_as_people_marketing_strategy | marketing push]] has aimed to turn brands into "people" with specific personality traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This approach makes brands appear more relatable to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Examples of brand personalities:
*   MoonPie was portrayed as a "stoner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   Sunny D was depicted as "sad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

This strategy has been so effective that consumers now expect such behavior from brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The creator states, "we are one with the brand, I am brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### "Brands Are Just Like Us"
This segment highlights instances where brands mimic human behaviors or situations:
*   **Wendy's** branched out from "roasting" people to writing fan fiction on Wattpad, creating romance stories like "The Lemonade Charade" and "The Forbidden Fruit Tea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. These stories attempt to empathize with working people, which is noted as unusual coming from a large corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Bagel Bites** rarely tweet about their actual product, making them relatable in their off-topic social media presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Brands playing video games**: Sunny D, Totino's, Bugles, Gushers, Chex Mix, and Kids Foot Locker were observed playing "Among Us" together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Brands showing emotion**: McDonald's expressed depression, with the Fall Guys account replying in support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Brands criticizing brands**: Brands have even been seen criticizing other brands' social media usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Direct communication**: The Slim Jim account directly messaged the creator, complimenting his video, which prompted speculation about whether it was a "complicated marketing scheme" or an actual person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## Absurd Stunts and Promotions
Beyond relatable content, brands engage in elaborate stunts to capture public attention and drive sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **McDonald's celebrity transformations**:
    *   Travis Scott was "cursed" and turned into a Happy Meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
    *   J Balvin was transformed into a "chain" as a pun on McDonald's restaurant chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Xbox Fridge**: Xbox capitalized on the meme that its console resembled a fridge by creating an actual working Xbox Series X refrigerator and gifting it to celebrities like Snoop Dogg and iJustine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The reason for this stunt was simply to generate discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **KFC's ventures into entertainment**:
    *   KFC launched a dating simulator game on Steam, featuring a "heartthrob sexy" Colonel Sanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
    *   KFC Gaming announced the development of a "KFConsole," a literal gaming console with a built-in "chicken chamber" to keep food warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This project required extensive testing of graphics, connectivity, and, most importantly, the chicken chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## The Impact on Content Creators and Labor
The pursuit of [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | brand engagement]] raises questions about the labor and value of social media content.
*   Social media managers' jobs are often undervalued despite the creative content they produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   Companies like GameStop have reportedly pressured employees to create TikToks to become "TikTok famous" and attract customers, effectively demanding "free labor" and taking away their creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. It's argued that if companies expect "TikTok star salaries," they should be prepared to pay them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## The Cycle of Attention
The dynamic between brands and consumers/creators creates a self-perpetuating cycle:
1.  Brands engage in unusual or absurd behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
2.  People discuss these brand antics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
3.  Brands gain attention and make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
4.  This encourages brands to continue their strange behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

The content creator acknowledges playing into this cycle by making videos about brand antics, becoming "a lightning rod for thirsty brands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Often, the brands' content is considered "better than their product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. The creator himself earns income from ad-related content, highlighting the complex and intertwined incentives within this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Even personal connections with brand representatives can be ambiguous; for instance, the creator became "friends" with the person running the Steak-umm account, who offered a hat but never sent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, demonstrating that "brands can break your heart just like us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

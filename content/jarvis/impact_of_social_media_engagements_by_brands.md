Fast-food brands, and increasingly other companies, have adopted peculiar habits on Twitter to engage with consumers and establish a relatable presence. This trend aims to seem "hip and with-it" to appeal to younger audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While often humorous, these interactions can also appear strange or even dystopian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Wendy's: The Pioneer of Brand Roasting

Wendy's is largely credited with popularizing the trend of brands "roasting" individuals and competitors on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Their viral tweet asserting "our beef is way too cool to ever be frozen" led to a public exchange where they humorously dismantled a user's argument by pointing out the existence of refrigerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

This approach gained significant traction, leading to public celebration and media coverage of "Wendy's roasting people on Twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. However, this raises questions when a multi-million dollar corporation is "dunking on a regular ass person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The fact that many of the original tweets Wendy's responds to end up deleted can make it seem like Wendy's is harassing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Despite this, many users actively solicit "roasts" from the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Wendy's has achieved meme status, engaging in activities like a "surgery on a grape" tweet, streaming Fortnite to "destroy all the freezers," and even releasing a mixtape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The question arises whether this relatable persona is a deliberate strategy to increase sales, akin to a "sociopath" trying to get consumers to buy more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Widespread Adoption of the Trend

Following Wendy's success, many other brands have adopted similar social media strategies, leading to what some describe as a "dystopian" landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Burger King

Burger King is another prominent example of a brand "absolutely destroying their customers" on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. An instance included them telling a customer who complained about missing cheese to "use your words at the counter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. They also engage in awkward use of memes and post "absolute gibberish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Inter-Brand Dynamics

A common characteristic of this trend is the interaction between different brand accounts. Brands often engage in "friendly" exchanges or even "beefs," which sometimes appear to be invented drama to attract attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. An example is the "epic rap battle" between Wendy's and Wingstop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Burger King also conducted a marketing campaign offering free Whoppers if ordered at a McDonald's via their app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Product Personification

The trend extends beyond fast food to various products, often adopting human-like personas and backstories:

*   **Pop-Tarts:** Tweets in the first person, portraying itself as having "relationship problems" or "flexing on its ex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This gives the brand a "relatable identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Hot Pockets:** Portrays a "stoner cousin" persona with a "lack of effort" in its tweets, seemingly designed to appeal to users who are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Moon Pies:** A 100-year-old snack brand, unexpectedly became a "certified memer," engaging in flirty exchanges with Wendy's and roasting its own fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### The Self-Aware Brand: Steak-umm

An extreme example of this trend is Steak-umm, an obscure frozen beef product, which developed a "woke" and highly self-aware Twitter presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Steak-umm's tweets often critique [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brand social media]] itself, adopting an almost "anti-corporate" stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Its content is rarely about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> and has garnered a cult following, despite being included in "worst of" lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Why Young People Engage with Brands on Social Media

The prevalence of [[consumer_behavior_and_brand_interactions_on_social_media | brand interaction on social media]] raises questions about why young people gravitate towards brands for "love, guidance, and attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This phenomenon is attributed to factors such as:
*   Isolation from real communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>
*   Working disliked service jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>
*   Struggling to make ends meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>
*   Crushing student debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>
*   Growing up with the dawn of internet culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>
*   Feeling more alone and insecure despite full access to social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>

As a result, they turn to memes, absurdist humor, and even frozen meat companies on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This explains the drive behind [[brands_using_social_media_for_relatable_content | brands using social media for relatable content]].

## Effectiveness and Potential Downsides

This strategy appears effective, as demonstrated by Wendy's growth to nearly 3 million Twitter followers and booming business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. The "kids would say it's lit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

However, this type of marketing can be harmful. Companies could potentially engage in "shady" practices and hide behind a cartoon mascot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. An example given is a comment on the Wendy's mixtape lyrics page alleging "slave forever potatoes" alongside their "fresh never frozen beef" slogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This suggests [[the_impact_of_brand_antics_on_consumer_perception | the impact of brand antics on consumer perception]] isn't always positive.

On the other hand, this trend has positive aspects, such as enabling creators to support their careers through brand partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. While some view this advertising as "poisoning our culture," advertising is deeply embedded in society, exemplified by how diamond engagement rings became cultural norms due to a 1930s campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Therefore, these brand tweets are considered the "least of worries" in the broader scheme of societal influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

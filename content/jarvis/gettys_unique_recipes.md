Getty Sho, a Guinness World Record-holding hula hooper, has gained attention for her unconventional [[TikTok cooking hacks | TikTok cooking hacks]] despite not being primarily a cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Her unique approach to cooking often results in surprising and sometimes questionable dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Getty Spaghetti

One of Getty's notable recipes is "Getty Spaghetti," a dish that involves wrapping raw spaghetti in ground beef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Instructions for this dish include "karate chopping the beef" to instill fear in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. A key observation is that the spaghetti remains uncooked initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Additional ingredients include bell peppers, onion, a Bulgarian spice called "chubrica," and uniquely, Nerds candy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Getty claims the Nerds release sugars, making the dish sweet and helping to soften it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The final appearance is described as "Nerds on hamburger spaghetti" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The commentator notes that the Nerds are a "special touch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Flamin Hot Cheeto Mac and Cheese

Getty also creates a "flamin hot cheeto mac and cheese" from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The recipe begins by boiling Flamin' Hot Cheetos, including a portion of lime-flavored Cheetos for a hint of lime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The preparation offers minimal instruction on water quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

During the process, the Cheetos become a "liquid cheeto" mixture, described as smelling "absolutely foul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Cheese from mac and cheese powder is added, which is necessary for the dish to be considered mac and cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The final product is a lumpy, bright red pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The commentator's taste test reveals it "tastes like nothing" and lacks any "kick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Strawberry Fact or Cap

Getty presents a "food hack" called "Strawberry Fact or Cap," which involves cutting strawberries using a razor blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The method requires placing a single razor blade into one strawberry, then putting that strawberry into a bowl with other whole strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. The bowl is then shaken, with the blade supposedly "ricocheting" through the fruit to cut them magically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

The commentator attempts this, highlighting the stress of tossing a razor blade around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Despite Getty's demonstration showing perfectly diced strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, the commentator's attempt results in uncut strawberries with the razor blade stuck to the top of the container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The commentator concludes that it would be "cleaner and faster to just chop them with a knife" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a> and raises safety concerns about ingesting razor blades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

## Other Unconventional Recipes

Other recipes explored include:
*   **Boiled Egg in a Chip Bag** – A raw egg is dropped into a bag of Lay's potato chips, then boiled, resulting in an omelet in the shape of the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The chips are implied to be cooked inside the omelet, with the only seasoning coming from the chips' salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Concerns about the safety of boiling plastic bags are raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   **Mashed Potato Chips** – This involves boiling a bag of potato chips, straining them, and then adding garlic sauce, pepper, and butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. The commentator finds this "disgusting," noting it's just soggy potato chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The perceived benefit is avoiding cutting oneself while peeling potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Whipped Coffee** – A [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | viral food hack]] involving whisking coffee, sugar, and water for a long time (up to half an hour) to create a whipped mixture, which is then mixed into milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. The commentator finds the effort disproportionate to the result, as the same outcome could be achieved in 10 seconds without the extra work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

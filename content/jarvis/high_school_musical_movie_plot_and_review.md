From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

*High School Musical* (2006) is described as a "cultural juggernaut" and a Disney Channel original movie that, while "objectively very bad," is "subjectively... a loveable romp" that is still "quite bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. It's considered one of the best "teen crazes" to be a part of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>, and its soundtrack is regarded as "bangerz from start to finish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

The film's plot is essentially a modern "Romeo and Juliet" story, where two young love interests are kept apart by their "families" or cliques: Gabriella's "family" is the smart clique, and Troy's is the basketball team, led by his father, the coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Personal Connection to the Film

The speaker recalls being 14 when the movie was released, an age considered "too old" for Disney Channel, yet was "captivated by the stunning basketball scenes" and "phenomenal acting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Despite its flaws, they became "very into the [[cultural_impact_of_high_school_musical | High School Musical]] franchise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, even learning several [[musical_numbers_and_choreography_in_high_school_musical_2 | High School Musical dances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The film represents the speaker's own childhood journey of "learning to sing and dance" and "exploring [their] creativity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

## Plot Summary

### The Ski Lodge Meet-Cute

The movie opens at a ski lodge during New Year's Eve, where basketball star Troy Bolton and "freaky genius girl" Gabriella Montez are both vacationing with their respective "families" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Troy is seen playing basketball with his father, Coach Bolton (dubbed "Basketball Dad"), who teaches him his favorite move: "fake right and then break left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Gabriella is reading, prompting her "unsupportive mom" to send her to the "young adults party" downstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

At the party, a "pushy karaoke" MC bullies Troy and Gabriella into singing a duet, "Start of Something New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Despite initial hesitation, they quickly harmonize perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. They exchange numbers, or rather, "take photos of one another" on their "fossil" cell phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### East High and Cliques

One week later, Gabriella inconveniently transfers to East High School, home of the Wildcats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The school is characterized by distinct cliques that "shall never mix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>:
*   **The Basketball Boys**: Led by Chad, they are very focused on the upcoming championships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Ryan and Sharpay Evans**: The "rich kid entitled twins" who are theater partners, having starred in 17 school productions, often as romantic interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. They are likened to "Jamie and Cersei Lannister of East High" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Taylor McKessie**: Head of the "judgmental science geeks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Troy and Gabriella unexpectedly find themselves in the same homeroom/drama/English class, led by Mrs. Darbus, who speaks in a "cartoon theater accent" and "hates cellphones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Troy texting Gabriella in front of Darbus lands them both in detention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Auditions and Conflict

Troy and Gabriella discover their shared love for musical theater, but Troy wants to keep his singing a secret from his basketball friends, whose support is "very conditional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. At the musical sign-up sheets, Sharpay marks her territory by signing her name, leaving no room for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Troy confides in Chad about his interest in the musical, but Chad expresses an "unexplained hatred of show tunes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Troy's internal conflict manifests in the song "Get Your Head in the Game," where the basketball boys display a "very loose grasp on the game" but perform "basketball choreography" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

Meanwhile, Sharpay feels threatened by Gabriella's intelligence (e.g., correcting a teacher on a math problem) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. She uses "searchtheinternet.com" to uncover Gabriella's "freaky genius origins" in San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Sharpay then concocts her first "incredible plan" to sign Gabriella up for an "extracurricular activity" – the Scholastic Decathlon – to prevent her from auditioning for the musical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Detention involves building set pieces for a show no one will see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Troy attempts to open up to his "human basketball" father about trying something new, but his dad frames everything in terms of basketball moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Coach Bolton's "weird beef with Darbus" is identified as the "core conflict" causing Troy's dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

At the first audition, most students are "total garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Troy and Gabriella arrive late but are allowed to audition with the help of composer Kelsi, singing perfect harmonies to a song they've never seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. They get a callback, leading to uproar from Sharpay, the basketball boys, and the geeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

This leads to the song "Stick to the Status Quo," a "stereotype song" where Zeke, a basketball boy, reveals he wants to be a baker, much to everyone's disapproval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. The scene concludes with Gabriella "360 no-scopeing Sharpay with the cheese fries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

Chad and Taylor, to separate Troy and Gabriella, enact their "second plan," which involves tricking Troy into saying Gabriella is "just a girl" while streaming it to her in "perfect high-definition" via a "2006 web cam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This causes Troy and Gabriella to break up, but their "friends" immediately regret their actions and encourage them to pursue their hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Troy then reconciles with Gabriella by appearing on her balcony "like a serial killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

### The Climax: The Final Plan

The movie's climax centers around the "Final Plan," notable for being a movie with "three ridiculous plans and zero high school musicals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. Sharpay and Ryan use their "political control of Darbus" to change the callback time to coincide with both the basketball championship and the Scholastic Decathlon, both held at East High <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

On the "big day," Taylor and Gabriella hack into the East High power grid (which is "apparently on Wi-Fi" in 2006) to turn off the scoreboard, allowing Troy to leave the championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Gabriella then uses "some sort of stink gas" to pause the Scholastic Decathlon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

During Ryan and Sharpay's "Absolute Banger" performance of "Bop to the Top" (which includes "culturally insensitive" elements like "Ariba!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>), Troy and Gabriella arrive late for their callback. However, the evacuees from the sabotaged events flood the auditorium, prompting Darbus to declare, "Now that's showbiz!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. Troy helps a nervous Gabriella snap out of her "sunken place," and their performance of "Soarin'" captivates the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

Ultimately, Troy and Gabriella win "everything" – the championship, the scholastic decathlon, and the lead roles in a musical that "happens off screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Despite "several unresolved conflicts," such as Sharpay losing the lead role, she is "totally chill about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. The movie concludes with a dance to "We're All in This Together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a> and a post-credits scene of Sharpay enjoying Zeke's cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.

## Review and Analysis

While acknowledging the movie's objective flaws, such as its "insane" plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, the speaker expresses deep affection for *High School Musical*. The movie is praised for being "dumb," "campy," and "self-aware," which has allowed it to resonate and "stuck with me all-all these years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. The film's ability to evoke emotion, even after multiple viewings, suggests a deeper personal [[character_analysis_in_high_school_musical_the_musical_the_series | connection]] and [[character_development_in_high_school_musical_series | meaning]] beyond its surface-level absurdity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

The speaker notes various logical inconsistencies and humorous observations throughout the film:
*   The absurdity of Troy's "Basketball Dad" and his singular focus on the "fake right, break left" move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   The "plot device" nature of the "young adult party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   The strange concept of the [[cultural_impact_of_high_school_musical | High School Musical]] soundtrack existing within the movie's universe, creating a "grandfather paradox" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   The unlikeliness of characters singing "perfect harmonies for a song they have never seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   Chad's [[role_of_comedy_and_tropes_in_high_school_musical_2 | hypocritical hatred]] of musicals despite his expansive knowledge of the genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   The lack of actual musicals within a movie titled *High School Musical* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

## Legacy and Spin-offs

Despite its quirks, *High School Musical* has had a lasting [[impact_of_high_school_musical_2_on_pop_culture | cultural impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Its continued influence is highlighted by the creation of the [[high_school_musical_the_musical_the_series | High School Musical the Musical the Series]], a web series about students putting on a production of *High School Musical*, which is itself a play based on the movie, creating a meta-narrative: "It's a web series, it's about a play, that's about a movie, that's about a play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Bright Side is identified as one of the largest YouTube channels, boasting approximately 16 million subscribers within a year and a half of its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. The YouTube platform has actively promoted the channel, appearing frequently on user homepages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>.

The channel's success is not attributed to unique, well-researched, or highly produced content, but rather to "stealing from those channels" that do produce such content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Content Characteristics

Bright Side employs several tactics to maximize viewership and engagement:
*   **High Volume Posting** The channel posts 10 to 15-minute videos three times a day, a strategy likened to the [[critique_of_five_minute_crafts | Five Minute Crafts]] playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Clickbait Thumbnails** Bright Side uses clickbait thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Unlike [[critique_of_five_minute_crafts | Five Minute Crafts]], which uses exaggerated photoshops, Bright Side's clickbait often "straight up lies" or employs "fear-mongering sensationalist tactics," suggesting that "somebody's out to get you" or that "you're being lied to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. A recurring theme involves "call the police immediately" scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Contradictory Channel Description** Despite its description claiming to "always look on the bright side of life and stay positive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, one of its most common topics is death, with titles like "five riddles you must solve to stay alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Substance and Padding**
    *   Many videos are described as "devoid of substance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.
    *   Content is often derived from a single internet article, sometimes sourced, but other times presented as fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.
    *   Videos, even short ones, are padded with excessive pauses, slow speech, and long, unnecessary segments to increase watch time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. For example, a 2-minute actual content may be stretched into a 10-minute video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
*   **Riddle Videos** Bright Side has many "dark" riddle videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. These riddles often include new, unstated information required for the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>, or feature disturbing scenarios such as suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. They also frequently pose rhetorical questions to the audience, similar to children's educational programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.
*   **Production Quality Over Content** The channel invests in high production quality, which gives an illusion of legitimacy, but "skipped the content part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

## Plagiarism and Misinformation
Bright Side is accused of direct content and thumbnail copying. Examples include:
*   "Illegal things that you do every day," which copied both content and thumbnail from "The Infographic Show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.
*   "The Coastline Paradox" videos, where Bright Side allegedly stole and photoshopped a thumbnail from another creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.
*   A "put vinegar in a toilet" video that used the exact same photo as a video published six months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>.
Concerns are raised about potential misinformation, especially regarding health advice, given the channel's massive reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.

## Target Audience: Children
Evidence from comments sections, particularly on a video titled "This math trick will guess your age," suggests that a significant portion of Bright Side's audience consists of children, with many 10-year-olds commenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. This raises a "moral imperative to be responsible with content that children will see" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>.

## Ownership and Operations
Bright Side is owned by The Soul Publishing, a company that claims to be one of the largest media publishers globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>. The Soul Publishing also operates [[critique_of_five_minute_crafts | Five Minute Crafts]], indicating a shared corporate parentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>.

The company is described as a "content farm," producing 1,500 videos per month in 10 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. Despite The Soul Publishing's self-description of aiming for "perfection" and ensuring "facts are straight" and "sources are reliable and responsible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>, this contrasts sharply with the actual content observed on Bright Side.

Job listings for Bright Side freelance writers reveal unusual requirements, such as having an "impressive imagination," being a "perfectionist," following Bright Side for more than two months, and being an "intelligent and kind person who knows how it feels to love someone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>.

## Overall Critique
Bright Side is criticized for employing "manipulative tactics" and not being as responsible as it claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. As a large corporation, it is seen as "low-key using YouTube as a means of extracting advertiser dollars out of like the watching habits of children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. This exploitation is a function of the system and environment on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>.

Upon initial interaction, [[TikTok]] was perceived as a "cringy" app [00:00:13]. The content observed often felt like "thirst traps for preteens," which caused discomfort for the observer [00:04:08]. Early on, many videos appeared to be repetitive, featuring "the same ten songs" and individuals primarily engaging in challenges rather than diverse content [00:09:49].

A significant concern raised regarding [[TikTok]]'s content is the presence of "creepy dudes preying on really young kids" [00:16:13]. This issue is highlighted as "super awful," with a call for the platform to address it, especially given its substantial funding [00:16:26].

## Evolving Content and Community Dynamics

While initially seen as a "haven for cringy but ultimately harmless children" [00:02:14], the platform has evolved to become a "den of honestly hilarious memes and irony" [00:02:29]. However, this shift also introduces new complexities. The prevalence of [[tiktok_community_dynamics_and_meme_culture | memes]] and irony can make it difficult to discern "what's real and what's not" on the internet, particularly when dealing with potentially hateful content, such as observed "furry war" dynamics [00:20:09]. Despite the perceived shift, some content remains "cringingly earnest" [00:14:15].

The user base is diverse, including a minority of "horrible people" but a majority of "old people who actually have no idea what they're doing but are kind of cute" [00:16:34]. Additionally, there are many "young people chasing likes and clouds" and "preteens flexing" their possessions [00:17:14].

The platform's algorithm learns user preferences; by actively liking content that was genuinely funny, the user's feed became more entertaining, shifting towards a "Vine vibe" [00:13:07]. This customization highlights how user engagement can shape the content experience on the platform.

Despite concerns, the app is acknowledged to have "totally impressive stuff," with even figures like Tony Hawk using it for fun [00:12:22]. The potential for new content creators to emerge and "take it more seriously" is also recognized, akin to what happened with Vine [00:22:00].

*Sexy Beasts* is a new [[netflix_reality_tv_production | Netflix]] show that is described as a "very unnatural thing" to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. It is a new entry into the [[netflix_reality_tv_production | Netflix]] pantheon of dating shows with a twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Premise of Sexy Beasts

The show features singles who wear elaborate makeup and prosthetics to appear as "beasts" in an attempt to put true blind date chemistry to the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The definition of "beast" on the show is quite loose, with participants ranging from cute pandas to boiling trolls, which the narrator feels shouldn't be under the same umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*Sexy Beasts* on [[netflix_reality_tv_production | Netflix]] is based on an original show of the same name that aired on BBC Three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Comparing Sexy Beasts to Other Dating Shows

The show aims to go against [[comparison_with_other_dating_shows | traditional dating]] and dating apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. [[netflix_reality_tv_production | Netflix]] has other "hot hits" like shows where you "can't have sex" or "instead of seeing a person you see a pulsating blue wall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

The show asks if one could fall in love based on personality alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, a question the narrator believes the show fails to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. [[the_concept_and_criticism_of_love_is_blind_as_a_dating_show | Love is Blind]] is cited as a better, though still "stupid," test of this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. On *Sexy Beasts*, pretty much the only thing participants cannot see is someone's face, and even then, their eyes are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This leads to a criticism that the show is not different from [[criticisms_of_the_shows_approach_to_dating | superficial dating]] if appearances, even in costume, still dictate choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

The show received a "healthy like to dislike ratio" on its trailer and was "pretty ratioed" on social media, indicating a general lack of fan support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## The Show's Format

The show's format is more akin to MTV's *Next* than *Love is Blind*, being very isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Each episode introduces a "beast" who goes on dates with three other "beasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

The process is as follows:
1.  A basic bar date with three "beasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
2.  One "beast" is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
3.  A more in-depth date with the two remaining "beasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
4.  The main "beast" picks their preferred partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
5.  They then remove their masks to reveal their "normal regular everyday models" faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Everyone on the show is a very attractive model or professional athlete/model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

The show features a "typical snarky [[netflix_reality_tv_production | Netflix]] narrator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. All dates, both the first and second, appear to happen on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## A Deep Dive into Episode 5: The Rhino and The Dolphin

The narrator identifies Episode 5 as the most despised, opening with a dolphin girl named Nina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Nina (dubbed "Sextina Aquafina") seeks love and must choose between a scarecrow, a mantis, and a rhino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### The Contenders

*   **Scarecrow Man (Dustin):** Has stitched cheeks that are considered too "uncanny" and "too real," grossing out the narrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. He was the first to be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Mantis Man (Dominic):** A model who loves nightlife, leading the narrator to question why he's on a dating show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Rhino Man (Mick):** A holistic health practitioner from LA who describes himself as "the techno prince warrior poet monkey man spiritual cowboy on the hero's journey to liberate humankind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The narrator heavily dislikes him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He discusses "sex kung fu" which involves "Chinese philosophy with sexual energy meditation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Defining "Beast"

The show's interpretation of "beast" is questioned, especially when costumes are too close to humanoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Examples include a girl with exposed bone and blood who is "way harder to look at" than a "cute wolf guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The worst costume in the season is a girl described as an "unfortunately faced lady with a permanent frown," who is also eliminated first, suggesting appearance still plays a role despite the premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Dating Challenges

The dates are considered "super boring," often discussing how contestants used to be shy but are now confident enough for [[netflix_reality_tv_production | Netflix]] dating shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. The dates do not always seem fair; for example, Mantis Man goes on a bowling date, while Rhino Man gets a horse-drawn carriage ride, with the latter seeming more romantic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

On the bowling date, Nina humorously attempts to slide down the lane, believing if balls can go down, she can too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. On the horse-drawn carriage ride, Rhino Man's dialogue is often incomprehensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. He also bizarrely suggests they meditate during their date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. His meditation breathing and sighing are described as a "dance" and an "exorcism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

### The Revelation

Nina chooses the Rhino Man, Mick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. When revealed, Nina is described as "gorgeous" without her dolphin blowhole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Mick is a "culturally appropriative king" who speaks in a "Matthew McConaughey character" voice, saying phrases like "God has been kind to you too baby" and "I'm happy with what she looks like, and so right now I can feel my heart just opening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Despite meeting only that day, he calls Nina "babe" and refers to himself as a "beast" wrapped in a "pretty spiritual cowboy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

## Overall Impressions

The narrator was "entertained" by the show despite having "horrible taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The makeup is highly praised, noting that the team behind the original BBC show returned for the [[netflix_reality_tv_production | Netflix]] version and "did a great job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. However, the show itself receives a less enthusiastic review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) has introduced changes to YouTube regarding content creation and classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.

## Impact on Content Classification
COPPA requires YouTube channels to classify themselves as `[[youtube_content_targeting_children|kids channels]]` if they produce `[[youtube_content_targeting_children|content for children]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. This classification is intended to ensure compliance with privacy regulations for minors online.

Despite these regulations, many animated story channels, which often feature sensational and inappropriate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, are categorizing their videos under "education" rather than designating them as `[[youtube_content_targeting_children|content for kids]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. This raises questions about how these channels are navigating the `[[age_restrictions_on_youtube|age restrictions on YouTube]]` and `[[content_moderation_on_youtube|content moderation]]` guidelines established by COPPA.

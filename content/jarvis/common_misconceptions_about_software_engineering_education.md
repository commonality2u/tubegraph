Many common questions arise regarding how to get into software engineering, what to study, or where to attend college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Despite numerous online resources, accurate information can be scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Much of the widely available advice is misleading or unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Debunking Misleading Advice from wikiHow

One prominent source, wikiHow, provides advice on how to become a software engineer that contains several [[misleading_software_engineering_advice | misleading software engineering advice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### The Degree Dilemma

*   **Misconception**: Earning a degree in software engineering is the most useful path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Reality**: Software engineering is not the most popular major for software engineers; [[computer_science_degree_curriculum | Computer Science]] is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. While [[computer_science_degree_curriculum | Computer Science]] is described as a "more theoretical approach," most programs incorporate elements of software engineering into their curriculum, making graduates job-ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Premature Programming and Language Lists

*   **Misconception**: One should "begin programming immediately," even in grade school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Reality**: While learning to program is crucial, the advice to start extremely young or simply learn a list of languages is unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. It is more important to focus on what you want to build and then use the technology that helps achieve that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Overemphasis on Math

*   **Misconception**: Software engineers "sometimes create mathematical algorithms," implying extensive math study is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Reality**: The relevance of math depends heavily on the specific role. It might be crucial for a physics engine in a video game but irrelevant for building a blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Advice for Career Changers

*   **Critique**: wikiHow's advice for those [[career_transition_from_software_engineer_to_engineering_manager | switching careers]] largely mirrors the advice for students, ultimately suggesting enrolling in a degree program after other steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Reality**: Many individuals enter software engineering jobs with unrelated degrees, thanks to coding boot camps and online resources, negating the need for another four-year institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Challenging Hacker Noon's "Intensity"

Another source, Hacker Noon, offers advice that often includes warnings and an intense, gatekeeping tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### The Demands of Dedication and Passion

*   **Misconception**: Programming is "not for everyone" and requires "immense dedication" and "passion" to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. It claims that without passion, one will be "mercilessly left behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Reality**: Many successful software engineers are not "immensely dedicated" to their craft; some simply work to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. While passion can aid investment, it is not a prerequisite, and waiting for it can hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This highlights a [[the_role_of_passion_and_dedication_in_software_engineering | misconception about the role of passion and dedication in software engineering]].

### The "Challenging" Nature of the Job

*   **Misconception**: The career is excessively "challenging," involving "long hours of mentally taxing work, impossible deadlines, legacy unmaintainable code, inconsistent ambiguous requirements, and suboptimal office environments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Reality**: While [[challenges_faced_by_software_engineers | challenges faced by software engineers]] exist, it's often "just a job like any other one with challenging and rewarding parts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### The Myth of Being "Self-Taught"

*   **Misconception**: Software engineering "requires you to be self-taught," implying that "when your code breaks nobody's gonna be there to hold your hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Reality**: Teams and colleagues are typically available to support each other, as "groups can accomplish far more than the individual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Overall Critique of Such Advice

Much of this advice stems from survivorship bias and a superiority complex, suggesting that "the only way to do it is how I did it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This kind of "toxic bull" contributes to making the industry uninviting for those who don't fit a specific mold, fostering [[the_culture_and_identity_issues_in_tech_professions | culture and identity issues in tech professions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

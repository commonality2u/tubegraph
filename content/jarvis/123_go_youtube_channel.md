The YouTube channel [[123_go_trending_success_and_youtube_algorithms | 123 Go!]] has recently been trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> and has experienced rapid growth, gaining 1.6 million subscribers since February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This growth is part of a broader [[analysis_of_123_go_channel_growth | trend of channel growth]] for certain types of [[youtube_content_and_video_production | YouTube content]].

## Content Style and Themes
[[content_style_and_themes_of_123_go_videos | 123 Go!]] is perceived as an imitation of other [[content_farms_on_youtube | content farms]] like 5-Minute Crafts and Troom Troom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It combines the "weird life hacks" of 5-Minute Crafts with the "weird life hacks and pranks but with characters" and voice-overs characteristic of Troom Troom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The channel has been described as the "strangest" and "most pointless" YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### "Relatable Situations" Videos
Despite being marketed as "the most relatable channel on YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, a video titled "Relatable situations anybody can recognize" that topped the trending charts was found to be "the most unrelatable video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Examples of "relatable" scenarios include:
*   **"Piping mishap"**: A term used for what appears to be a major plumbing issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Exaggerated spider reactions**: A character sees a spider and packs a suitcase to leave their apartment for "two, three days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The suggested solution of using bug spray on a large spider is also questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Dishwashing woes**: A character struggles with a sink full of dishes, and a "piping problem" leads to a large amount of water spewing from a spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Broken nail**: A character with false nails attempts to pick up a coffee with her nail, leading to it breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Grocery challenge**: A character goes through an elaborate push-up routine to "warm up her muscles" before carrying an excessive amount of groceries in one trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Prank and DIY Videos
Another common theme for [[content_style_and_themes_of_123_go_videos | 123 Go!]] is pranks and DIYs, often featuring keyword-stuffed titles for [[youtube_algorithm_and_channel_content_strategy | YouTube algorithm]] optimization, like "seven funny DIY school pranks easy pranks for back to school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

Examples from "seven funny DIY school pranks":
*   **Play-Doh Gum Prank**: Involves using an X-Acto knife to cut Play-Doh into a square to resemble gum in a wrapper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This raises concerns about [[age_restrictions_on_youtube | age appropriateness]] due to the use of sharp objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The impracticality of a gum wrapper with no actual gum inside is also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Soy Sauce "Coke" Prank**: A prank involving mixing Sprite and soy sauce to create a drink that looks like Coke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. The narrator bizarrely lists coke, soy sauce, and Sprite as "three of my favorite things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. The strong smell would make this prank immediately obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Carrot-in-Chocolate-Box Prank**: Involves replacing chocolates in a box with carrots and a rotten banana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The setting for this prank features an ornate wooden pepper grinder in a school lunch hall, suggesting an unrealistic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

## Production and Narrative Peculiarities
The videos are noted for their strange production qualities:
*   **Uncanny Valley Language**: The dialogue often feels "close enough to make you uncomfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, with phrases like "piping mishap" being incompatible with the gravity of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Narration**: The voice-over frequently changes tense, sometimes speaking as the character, other times speaking to or about the character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The narrator often asks rhetorical questions to the audience, similar to Dora the Explorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Settings**: Many scenes appear to be filmed on sound stages with white backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. The depicted living spaces (e.g., an apartment with only a couch and no kitchen) are highly impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Ambiguous [[youtube_channel_demographics | Demographics]]**: The content raises questions about its target [[age_restrictions_on_youtube | audience]] and age appropriateness, with scenarios featuring adults in seemingly childlike situations or engaging in pranks with dangerous tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The age of the characters is often comically inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

Overall, 123 Go! is seen as a bizarre and often nonsensical channel, producing [[youtube_content_and_video_production | content]] that is difficult to relate to despite its claims of relatability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

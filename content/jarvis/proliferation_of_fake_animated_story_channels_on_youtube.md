The landscape of YouTube has seen a significant rise in channels presenting [[overview_of_animated_story_channels | animated stories]], often claiming to be true, yet frequently lacking authenticity. This phenomenon, referred to as the [[proliferation_of_fake_animated_story_channels | proliferation of fake animated story channels]], has raised questions about content veracity and journalistic integrity on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Case Study: "Actually Happened"

The channel "Actually Happened" became a prominent example within this trend. It claimed to tell the stories of children, animating them and using professional voice actors to narrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, implying the narratives were authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Evidence of Fabrication

Despite its claims, the authenticity of "Actually Happened"'s stories was repeatedly questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>:
*   **Verbatim Reddit Threads** Many stories were found to be almost verbatim copies of old Reddit threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Examples included specific scenarios like breaking up due to potatoes, which was "too specific to have happened to more than one person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Provably Untrue Narratives** Over time, the channel allegedly shifted to stories that were "provably untrue," containing enough detail to suggest they were entirely fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. An example cited was a school confiscating water bottles for "unknown reasons," which was reported in "daily shows and news broadcasts" within the story itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Celebrity Impersonations** The channel also began featuring stories ostensibly told from the first-person perspectives of real-life celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Billie Eilish, and Jackie Chan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### The Disappearance of "Actually Happened"

On June 8th, "Actually Happened" reportedly "disappeared without a trace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While the channel page remained visible, all videos were gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

#### Not a YouTube Takedown
It was determined that YouTube did not take down the channel, as typical YouTube suspensions display a message indicating a violation of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Instead, all videos were made private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, meaning only the channel owner could access them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

#### Parent Company and Revenue
"Actually Happened" was a property of The Soul Publishing, known for other channels like "5-Minute Crafts" and "Bright Side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. While it was listed among their properties in April, it was later removed from The Soul Publishing's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, indicating the disappearance was intentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

The channel was estimated to earn "upwards of four hundred thousand dollars a month," totaling around "5 million dollars in yearly earnings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. It was considered "illogical" for such a business to halt revenue abruptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

#### Theories for Disappearance
The specific reasons for "Actually Happened"'s disappearance remain unverified, leading to conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>:
*   **Re-release under a new identity** The Soul Publishing is known for reusing content across channels and even starting new ones by "reposting content from old ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This tactic is seen with "5-Minute Crafts" and its sister channels like "5-Minute Crafts Girly" and "5-Minute Crafts Men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Legal Battle** It is speculated that a legal battle could have forced the channel to make its videos private to prevent further revenue generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The inability to delete videos permanently might have made privacy the only other option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Corporate Nature** The lack of public statement regarding the disappearance is attributed to the channel being a "corporate entity" and a "money making operation" rather than a personal creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## The Proliferation of Fake Animated Story Channels

"Actually Happened" was not an isolated incident but rather a prominent example of a broader trend of [[criticism_of_fake_animated_stories_on_youtube | fake animated stories on YouTube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Origins and Copycats
The channel "Actually Happened" itself began as a copy of "Storybooth," a legitimate channel that works with children and their families to tell authentic stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. However, "Actually Happened"'s success inspired a "proliferation of copycat channels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

These channels often use variations of common words like "story," "animated," "happened," and "my" in their names, such as "Actually Happened Animate My Story," "My Story Animated," "My Crazy Story," and "My Story Worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### "My Story Animated"
"My Story Animated" is highlighted as another significant channel in this genre. Founded by an Israeli app developer, it boasts nearly as many subscribers as "Actually Happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This channel is noted for having "far more objectionable content," including sensationalist titles like "I eat scorpions for breakfast to become poisonous" or "I am a bodybuilder and my boyfriend is a tiny little guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Intent and Impact
These channels primarily "manipulate the emotions of children for views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The existence of numerous similar channels means that even if one disappears, the problem persists as a "game of whack-a-mole" unless addressed "systemically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The broader issue of [[impact_of_fake_stories_on_youtube | fake stories on YouTube]] and their [[authenticity_of_animated_story_channels | authenticity]] remains a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

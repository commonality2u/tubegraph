Jarvis, a software engineer, has undergone a significant professional shift, transitioning from a software engineer role to an engineering manager, a change he views as a natural progression stemming from his lifelong approach to learning and personal interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This journey highlights how diverse passions can unexpectedly shape and inform a career path.

## The Influence of Obsession and Self-Improvement

From a young age, Jarvis exhibited an "obsessive" personality, pouring himself into whatever he wanted to master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This dedication, coupled with a love for learning and improving, has been a constant in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. He thrives on feeling like an underdog, using that chip on his shoulder to push beyond perceived limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This competitive drive was evident in his involvement in competitive games like Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic: The Gathering, and chess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He even wrote guides on Pokémon training and appeared on a Pokémon podcast under a pseudonym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

More recently, Jarvis's passion for improv comedy, inspired by his obsession with Saturday Night Live and idols like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, led him to take every class, attend every show, and eventually perform almost weekly for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Unconventional Paths to Software Engineering

Jarvis's entry into programming was similarly organic and unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. His 7th-grade technology class, which introduced him to Macs and Macromedia tools like Photoshop and Dreamweaver, ignited his fascination with creating websites and videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. He particularly enjoyed making Flash videos and games using ActionScript, though he initially relied on a classmate for code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

His real dive into programming came during his junior year of high school, sparked by his interest in podcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. After discovering a Dragon Ball Z podcast, he stumbled upon "Geek Nights," a show by tech professionals that discussed computer majors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This led him to decide he needed to learn programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. He began learning the basics of programming on a TI-84 calculator, becoming "addicted" and deciding to study computer science in college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Professional Responsibilities

Jarvis emphasizes that the [[the_importance_of_genuine_passion_in_career_success | interests you have now won't take you where you expect them to]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. His journey illustrates how past interests, like Dragon Ball Z leading to software engineering, are never truly gone but contribute to one's present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

As he gained experience as a software engineer in San Francisco, Jarvis began to focus on aspects of software creation beyond just writing code, particularly the dynamics of high-performing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. He observed that team happiness correlated with performance and that people often leave managers, not companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

He applied lessons from his personal life, such as [[challenging_relationship_dynamics | team dynamics learned in improv]] and coaching skills developed as a college teaching assistant and industry mentor, to his professional role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. These observations and experiences led him to transition from a software engineer to an engineering manager, a role where writing code is no longer the primary responsibility but is still related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This transition, while seemingly dramatic, felt natural to him, representing a continued alignment of his interests in improving, coaching, and understanding team dynamics within a technical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

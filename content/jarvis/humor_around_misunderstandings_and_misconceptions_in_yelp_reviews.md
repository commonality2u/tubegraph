From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Yelp reviews, particularly one-star ratings, often provide a source of unintentional humor due to the significant misunderstandings and misguided perceptions held by the reviewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a>. According to Jarvis, to write a one-star review, a person must either hate the business intensely or believe the business's actions were so egregious they deserve severe consequences, which is rarely the actual case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>. The complaints frequently revolve around irrelevant issues that have little to do with the business itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>.

## Customer Conspiracies and Entitlement

Many one-star reviews are rooted in elaborate conspiracy theories or a profound sense of entitlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:13">[03:30:13]</a>.

### The Phil's Coffee Tipping Conspiracy
One reviewer for Phil's Coffee claimed a secret system where cashiers and baristas used "jargon or gestures" to identify non-tippers, allegedly resulting in bad coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:11">[02:51:11]</a>. This theory is debunked by the fact that customers don't pay until after their coffee is started, making it impossible for staff to know about a tip beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:12">[03:09:12]</a>. The underlying misconception is that the business would intentionally serve bad coffee unless tipped, a system that would serve no one's interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:35">[03:15:35]</a>.

## National Parks: A Hub of Misconceptions

Nowhere is the sense of [[discussion_on_the_misguided_overentitlement_in_yelp_reviews | entitlement]] and misunderstanding more apparent than in reviews for national parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:25">[03:42:25]</a>.

### Grand Canyon National Park
Despite being a natural wonder revealing millions of years of geological history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>, the Grand Canyon receives comical one-star reviews:
*   **Lack of Amenities**: One reviewer, "Jor BP," described it as "a giant hole in the ground" that lacks "roller coasters or dippin dots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:26">[04:00:26]</a>.
*   **Unimpressed by Nature**: Another, "Barry G," stated, "I've seen better big whoop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:20">[04:22:20]</a>, seemingly trying to appear "cool" by not enjoying the natural spectacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:35">[04:27:35]</a>.
*   **Unfavorable Comparisons**: A reviewer claimed the Grand Canyon was "a joke" compared to Yellowstone, lamenting "no animals, no greenery, no clear blue streams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:42">[05:01:42]</a>. This highlights a misconception that all natural parks should offer the same experience.

### Yellowstone National Park
Yellowstone, known for its dramatic canyons, geysers, and abundant wildlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:13">[06:04:13]</a>, also falls victim to humorous one-star reviews stemming from absurd expectations:
*   **"Dull" Scenery**: One reviewer surprisingly declared, "I hated Yellowstone," finding the place "dull" despite acknowledging its "very scenic" and "breathtaking" beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:01">[06:27:01]</a>.
*   **Traffic and Parking Issues**: Complaints included "terrible traffic" and "little tiny parking lots" for sights like geysers, with one reviewer comically seeming to want to park their car inside a geyser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:03">[06:52:03]</a>.
*   **Animal Sightings**: A reviewer griped about only seeing "some bison" after a full day, claiming to have seen moose and deer *outside* the park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:08">[07:05:08]</a>.
*   **"Grass" in the Park**: One review expressed incredulity about paying $30 for a park that had "grass inside of your park," comparing it unfavorably to grass at their own home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:15">[07:11:15]</a>.
*   **Lack of Cell Service**: A common complaint was the "little to absolutely no service" and expensive, slow Wi-Fi, showing a desire for urban connectivity in a wilderness area designed for preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:04">[09:00:04]</a>.
*   **Food Quality and Variety**: One reviewer went on a "hunger strike" due to a "lack of variety and taste" in the park's food, comparing it unfavorably to school lunches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:10">[09:35:10]</a>.
*   **Underwhelmed by Geysers**: A reviewer was "extremely underwhelmed" by the geysers, suggesting people "boil a pot of water at home" for a similar look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:56">[08:39:56]</a>.

### Glacier National Park
Glacier National Park hosted some of the most "buck wild" reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:39">[10:50:39]</a>:
*   **Speed Limit Confusion**: A reviewer issued a "warning" about a 40 mph speed limit, acting as if they were trying to explain a traffic ticket they received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:30">[11:13:30]</a>.
*   **Snow in June/UFO Theory**: Another complained about half the road being closed "due to snow" in June, despite "no snow on the mountains," leading to the absurd conclusion of a "pretty fishy" situation or potentially a UFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:36">[11:58:36]</a>.
*   **"Worst Review Ever"**: One reviewer, Joe, expressed extreme frustration with the park rangers, claiming "extreme control of nature and bears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:06">[13:06:06]</a>. Joe was upset about rules preventing his daughter from taking a rock, restrictions on where they and their dog could go, and being monitored during picnics to ensure food was packed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:12">[13:35:12]</a>. The humor arises from Joe's outrage at rangers doing their job (e.g., preventing littering to protect against bears) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:04">[13:19:04]</a>. Joe even called the mountain goat with a tracking collar "very artificial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:04">[14:55:04]</a>, missing the purpose of wildlife tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:52">[15:03:52]</a>.

These examples of [[experiences_with_humorous_and_exaggerated_yelp_reviews | humorous and exaggerated Yelp reviews]] demonstrate a consistent pattern of reviewers projecting unrealistic expectations onto natural environments and businesses, leading to often comical misconceptions and misplaced criticisms.

From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The internet, particularly platforms like Twitter, has seen a growing trend of fast-food brands adopting unconventional and often humorous social media personas to engage with audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This phenomenon involves brands trying to appear "hip" and "with-it" to appeal to younger demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. While sometimes effective and funny, these [[Marketing strategies involving humor and memes | marketing strategies involving humor and memes]] can also be strange or even problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Wendy's: A Pioneer in Roasting Culture

[[wendys_viral_twitter_interactions_and_roasting_culture | Wendy's]] is largely credited with popularizing this trend on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Their approach involves "roasting" both customers and competitors alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### The "Fresh, Never Frozen" Beef Saga
A notable example occurred when Wendy's tweeted about their beef being "way too cool to ever be frozen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. A user challenged this, stating, "Your beef is frozen and we all know it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Wendy's responded by questioning how the user stores cold, unfrozen items, eventually leading to the user deleting their tweets and Wendy's being perceived as having "finished him off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Public Reception and Criticisms
This type of interaction led to widespread celebration, with compilations like "Top 80 Wendy's Clap Back Tweets Part 3" garnering significant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. However, this raises questions about celebrating a multi-million dollar corporation "dunking on a regular ass person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Many tweets that Wendy's replied to were deleted, making their responses appear like harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

A bizarre phenomenon emerged where thousands of people began begging Wendy's to roast them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Wendy's has largely achieved [[viral_meme_pages_and_their_impact | meme status]], often playing into popular internet trends like "surgery on a grape" memes, streaming Fortnite (where they destroyed in-game freezers in homage to their "no frozen beef" motto), and even releasing a mixtape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

While entertaining, this marketing strategy can be seen as a calculated effort to increase engagement and sales, suggesting a "sociopathic" approach to getting customers to buy more products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Other Brands Join the Fray

Following Wendy's success, many other brands have adopted similar [[strategies_of_fastfood_brands_on_twitter | strategies on Twitter]], sometimes leading to "dystopian" results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Burger King
Burger King frequently employs similar tactics, including "absolutely destroying their customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. In one instance, a customer complained about not getting cheese on a cheeseburger, to which Burger King retorted, "Pro tip: if you want cheese on your whopper, use your words at the counter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Burger King also awkwardly uses popular memes and tweets seemingly nonsensical gibberish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Brands often interact with each other in replies, creating a dynamic akin to friends at a "school lunch table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This can even involve inventing "drama," such as a rap battle between Wendy's and Wingstop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, or Burger King's "one-sided beef" with McDonald's where they offered free Whoppers to customers who ordered them at a McDonald's via their app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Beyond Fast Food: Products with Personality
The trend extends beyond fast-food chains to various products:

*   **Pop-Tarts**: The brand's Twitter account tweets in the first person, often about relationship problems or fear of intimacy, giving the product a "relatable identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Hot Pockets**: This brand aims for a "stoner cousin" identity, with tweets that are often nonsensical or feature "lack of effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **MoonPies**: A century-old snack brand, MoonPies has become a "certified meme lord" on Twitter, known for self-deprecating humor and even flirty exchanges with other brands like Wendy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. They also engage in roasting their fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### Steak-umm: Self-Aware Brand Twitter
The frozen beef snack brand Steak-umm exemplifies the "implosion" of brand Twitter accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Despite being an obscure product, Steak-umm has gained a significant following for its "woke" and highly self-aware tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Their account often criticizes the very nature of [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brands using social media for relatable content]] and meme culture, sometimes appearing "anti-corporate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This meta-commentary has led to a cult following, though some critics find their self-awareness problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Why Young People Engage with Brand Twitter
The phenomenon of young people flocking to brands on social media for "love, guidance, and attention" is attributed to feelings of isolation and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Growing up with the internet, student debt, and feeling disconnected, they turn to memes, absurdist humor, and even frozen meat companies for connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Impact and Conclusion
While sometimes entertaining, this type of [[marketing_strategies_involving_humor_and_memes | marketing strategy]] can be seen as problematic. It allows companies to hide potentially "shady" business practices behind a "cartoon mascot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. For example, Wendy's has been criticized for using "slave forever potatoes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

However, this trend also facilitates new forms of entertainment and business for creators through brand partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. While some view it as "poisoning our culture," advertising has long been deeply integrated into society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. These brand tweets, therefore, might be the "least of our worries" in the broader landscape of modern advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

This article examines the ethical concerns surrounding content appropriation on YouTube, using the channel "Facts Verse" as a primary example. This channel showcases how low production quality combined with extensive use of [[copyright_issues_and_content_plagiarism_on_youtube | other people's content]] can lead to a problematic business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

## Facts Verse: An Overview

"Facts Verse" is a YouTube channel with approximately 5 million subscribers on YouTube and 2 million on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Their content primarily consists of list videos and news story videos, often focusing on birth stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Popular video titles include "15 everyday things you've been doing wrong" and "10 horse breeds that you will not believe exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Content Quality and Accuracy
The "facts" presented on the channel range from opinion-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, to demonstrably wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>, and even "downright harmful" advice, such as suggesting plugging a flash drive into a phone charger or plugging unverified USB drives found in public into a laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. The channel also features "grotesque thumbnails and triggering topics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

The quality of their content, particularly regarding factual accuracy, is consistently poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. It is speculated that their "facts" are sourced from subreddits like "Today I Learned" and "WTF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

## Evidence of Content Appropriation

A significant ethical concern with "Facts Verse" is its apparent reliance on content appropriation. The channel frequently includes a generic [[copyright_issues_and_content_plagiarism_on_youtube | copyright disclaimer]] message in every video description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This suggests an awareness of [[fair_use_and_copyright_issues_on_youtube | copyright issues]] and a potential need to "ward off evil spirits known as copyright strikes" due to "constantly stealing other people's content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

Specific examples of alleged content appropriation include:

*   **"10 things you did not know what they are"**: This list video contains a list of facts, including information about the loop on the back of shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. The exact same list was found verbatim on other content farm websites like "Bright Side" and "Cat Fly.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
*   **"10 Pokemon that actually exists in real life"**: This video presents information about Pok√©mon that is factually incorrect and appears to be written by someone with no knowledge of the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. For example, it claims Bulbasaur is inspired by a frog and is a reptile, despite frogs being amphibians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.
*   **"Photos to test your intelligence"**: This video features spot-the-difference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. The channel's narrator either misses multiple differences or provides incorrect answers. This entire list of images was also found in an article on "Life Buzz," another content farm blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.
*   **"18 awful lies around daily use objects"**: This video appears to be directly ripped from a BuzzFeed list, which itself curated content from Reddit. "Facts Verse" essentially narrates the BuzzFeed list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> While "Facts Verse" videos might have some editing or "quippy dialogue," the content is not sufficiently transformed to be considered original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.

## Ethical Implications

The business model of "Facts Verse" raises significant [[discussion_on_youtube_content_creation_challenges | ethical concerns]] regarding content creation and monetization on YouTube. Even if the channel faces [[copyright_issues_and_content_plagiarism_on_youtube | copyright claims]] or disputes, it still generates substantial revenue from content created by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.

The channel's approach highlights broader [[criticism_of_lowquality_content_on_youtube_channels | issues with low-quality content]] and [[criticism_of_sensationalist_content_on_youtube | sensationalist content]] on YouTube, particularly when it also contains harmful or misleading information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. It implicitly tests the viewer's intelligence by seeing if they will accept a random YouTube video as fact, even when the information is incorrect or stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.

The lack of originality and extensive reliance on appropriated material underscores ongoing debates about [[content_moderation_on_youtube | content moderation]] and the standards for original content on the platform.

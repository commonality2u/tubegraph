The world of [[overview_of_animated_story_channels | animated story channels]] on YouTube has been a subject of scrutiny and mockery, becoming a "laughing stock" for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Despite the speaker's efforts to avoid making videos about them, strange events continue to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Recent Incidents and Channel Conflicts

Weeks before the video, the largest of these [[proliferation_of_fake_animated_story_channels_on_youtube | animated story channels]] disappeared without a trace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Following this, "My Story Animated" (MSA) emerged as the "de facto king of sensationalist animated stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### My Story Animated vs. Jay

MSA engaged in a conflict with YouTuber Jay, who had created a reaction video to one of their animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. MSA demanded Jay remove the video and threatened his channel, claiming they had sent messages on YouTube and email, to which Jay never responded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

MSA's communication style was described as resembling that of an "eighth grader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, with one message comparing themselves to major franchises like *Game of Thrones*, *Death Note*, and *Avatar: The Last Airbender* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This lengthy message was later deleted because it was deemed "too long and no one was reading it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

A shorter statement followed, asserting MSA's right to deny anyone from using their videos, claiming they have the "same rights to our work as any big studio or franchise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This stance ignores the concept of [[fair_use]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

MSA also contradicted their own past statements, where they had previously encouraged YouTubers to make reaction videos without seeking approval, stating, "You don't need our approval to do them, we'll allow any Youtuber to make them freely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The speaker speculates that these changes in position stem from a decline in the popularity and views of [[critique_of_animated_story_channels | animated story channels]], making major players "dropping like flies" and causing channels to become paranoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## True Stories Channel and "Gross" Content

The speaker's current focus shifted to an "up-and-coming channel" called "True Stories," which he describes as having a "penchant for... gross ass content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The channel claims to produce [[analysis_of_fake_animated_story_channels | animated stories]] for mature audiences, intended to promote critical thinking and moral reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### "My Mother Loves My Cream"

The speaker previously mentioned "True Stories" for their video titled "My mother loves my cream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The title is not [[clickbait_animation_channels | clickbait]]; the video genuinely depicts a mother using her son's semen for skincare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The speaker accidentally contributed to its popularity by bleeping out "cream" in his earlier video, which prompted viewers to search for the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### "I'm a Breastfed Adult": True Stories Targets Jarvis

"True Stories" later released a video titled "I'm a breastfed adult," featuring an animated character named "Jarvis" with a similar haircut and wearing a "Breast is Best" shirt, clearly parodying the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The story depicts Jarvis as an adult addicted to breast milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

The speaker chose to make a reaction video to this content, despite it being exactly what the channel wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. He strongly advises viewers not to support "True Stories," emphasizing that it is not a [[creating_parody_animation_channels | parody]] channel, as it lacks commentary or critique and features the same "sensational gross" content as other problematic channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Analysis of the "Breastfed Adult" Video

The speaker notes that the animated "Jarvis" character in the video was not flattering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The story itself is filled with absurd details, such as:
*   Jarvis describing different "flavor profiles" for left and right breasts (banana vs. chocolate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   A scene where Jarvis, as a child, bites his mother while breastfeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   His mother coming to school to breastfeed him during class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   Continuing to nurse through middle school, with staff allegedly providing a private room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   Drinking breast milk from a glass in middle school for "class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   His older sister, Amanda, pumping milk for him in college after having a baby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   His girlfriend, Janelle, agreeing to breastfeed him after they have a child, despite his bizarre explanation of why adult breastfeeding is "biologically normal" and not weird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

The video also includes anti-dairy propaganda and pseudo-scientific claims about breast milk being the "perfect food for growing humans" nutritionally, immunologically, and psychologically, without specifying that this applies primarily to babies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. The speaker highlights that this "fake science" is used to paint him as a "booby boy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

## Conclusion on Authenticity and Impact

The speaker states he is "pretty sure" he does not run "True Stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. He concludes that the channel is seeking attention through such absurd content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Despite trying to determine if "True Stories" is a [[creating_parody_animation_channels | parody]], it "doesn't seem like it is," and is "probably just the real thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. This reflects broader concerns about the [[authenticity_of_animated_story_channels | authenticity]] and intent behind many [[criticism_of_fake_animated_stories_on_youtube | fake animated stories on YouTube]].

He committed to donating all proceeds from a limited run of "trying my breast" shirts to breast cancer research, aiming to make good out of the "nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

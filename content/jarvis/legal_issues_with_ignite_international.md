Ignite International is a company founded by Dan Bilzerian in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:57">[02:55:57]</a>. Bilzerian's initial claim was that the company's money flow had been continuous since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:02">[02:59:02]</a>. The company aims to be a "premium lifestyle brand" selling products like THC, CBD, and beverages, along with "everything else CBD THC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:20">[09:15:20]</a>. Its logo is a goat skull, which is "plastered everywhere" on Bilzerian's Instagram, leading to speculation that he believes placing the logo on items makes them business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:44">[09:41:44]</a>.

## Financial Performance and Lawsuit

Despite the initial impression of success, Ignite faced significant financial challenges. In the year prior to the discussion, the company reportedly lost $50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:04">[03:02:04]</a>. While they generated approximately $10 million in revenue, this still resulted in substantial losses, bringing them to "about break even" after accounting for both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>.

The company is currently being sued by its former president, Curtis Heffernan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>. Heffernan, who has a traditional business background, attributes Ignite's $50 million loss entirely to Dan Bilzerian's "buckwild spending habits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:56">[03:55:56]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Allegations of Misuse of Company Funds
> The lawsuit alleges that "everything surrounding Dan Bilzerian's lavish lifestyle is paid for by his company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:04">[04:04:04]</a>.

This alleged misuse of company funds includes:
*   **Mansion Rent** – Ignite reportedly pays $200,000 per month for the rent of Bilzerian's mansion, which he wants people to believe he owns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:11">[04:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:53">[21:51:53]</a>. He was recently "kicked out," a departure reportedly celebrated by his neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:26">[04:24:26]</a>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the former president advised that a $200,000/month mansion might not be necessary, but Bilzerian insisted on hosting summer pool parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:54">[21:55:54]</a>.
*   **Lavish Parties** – Ignite threw a Halloween party involving pyrotechnics and a parachutist dropping with sparklers in Los Angeles, despite the dry conditions in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:36">[04:34:36]</a>.
*   **Personal Expenses** – Allegedly, Bilzerian did not pay for rented yachts, paid models, or even his own $50,000 bed frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:52">[04:51:52]</a>. Other reported expenses include a $60,000 Star Wars gun set, a $40,000 rock wall, a $15,000 ping pong table, and an $88,000 vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:01">[19:59:01]</a>.

## Company Outlook and Business Practices

An independent auditor has stated that the company's failure is "imminent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:55">[19:55:55]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Questionable Financial Practices
> Ignite allegedly took in coronavirus aid money and attempted to characterize it as income on their books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:11">[21:11:11]</a>. They also reportedly spent $26,000 to boost Dan Bilzerian's Instagram following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:31">[21:31:31]</a>.

The situation suggests that Bilzerian's business practices are leading Ignite "into the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:31">[13:29:31]</a>. This contrasts sharply with his self-proclaimed authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:23">[21:22:23]</a>, highlighting the significant disconnect between his public image and the reality of his business operations.

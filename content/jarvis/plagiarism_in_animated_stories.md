The landscape of animated story channels on platforms like YouTube has seen a rise in "content farms" that often rely on copied or fabricated narratives for engagement and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This phenomenon highlights issues of [[authenticity_of_animated_story_channels|authenticity of animated story channels]] and ethical content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## My Story Animated: A "Copy of a Copy"

[[critique_on_my_story_animated|My Story Animated]] is described as the latest in "clickbait animation channels full of overdramatic and probably fake stories submitted by kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. The channel claims to provide a "digital platform that provides people with the opportunity to share their most interesting and life-changing stories with the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

However, its premise is noted as being highly similar to "Actually Happened," another animation channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. "Actually Happened" itself is considered a copy of "Storybooth," which is a legitimate channel that works with kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This lineage makes [[critique_on_my_story_animated|My Story Animated]] a "copy of a copy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, characterized by "absurd clickbait and really lazy production quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### Evidence of Copying

*   **Shared Premise**: Both [[critique_on_my_story_animated|My Story Animated]] and Actually Happened claim to animate stories sent by kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **"About" Page Link**: When [[critique_on_my_story_animated|My Story Animated]] launched, the subscribe link on their "about" page still directed users to Actually Happened's channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   **Content Origin**: Both channels are suspected of either "making it all up or stealing it from Reddit verbatim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## Fabricated and Stolen Narratives

A central [[critique_of_animated_story_channels|critique of animated story channels]] like [[critique_on_my_story_animated|My Story Animated]] and Actually Happened is their reliance on fake or stolen stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

### Examples of Suspected Plagiarism/Fabrication

*   **"I broke up with my girlfriend because of potatoes"**: This story, featured on [[critique_on_my_story_animated|My Story Animated]], bears a striking resemblance to an "oddly specific story" posted on the "Today I Fucked Up" subreddit three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Unrelatable Characters**: Many stories feature "extremely unrelatable people that definitely don't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, such as "I was too innocent when I got into the top secret vampire society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a> or "I'm the richest person in my school and it's embarrassing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. These narratives often include fantastical or highly improbable events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Fictional Police Reports**: To lend credibility to their [[fake animated stories|fake animated stories]], channels like [[critique_on_my_story_animated|My Story Animated]] often include "a summary of a police statement at the end of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. These statements are deemed unrealistic, as police would not release reports to random YouTube channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. Examples include "I found a thief in my room and I had smarted him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>, where the police report was supposedly obtained from the protagonist's parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

## The Business Model of Content Farms

The proliferation of these channels, which produce low-quality content, is seen as a "money grab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. They function as "content farms" that find a market for animated story channels and then "pump out a ton of like low quality content and make money because they're able to advertise it to people who like don't know any better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[01:48:43]</a>. This practice exemplifies the [[impact_of_clickbait_in_animated_stories|impact of clickbait in animated stories]] and [[sensationalism_in_animated_stories|sensationalism in animated stories]] driving content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

Zbolly is known for developing various apps and websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

The overall [[criticism_of_fake_animated_stories_on_youtube|criticism of fake animated stories on YouTube]] centers on their lack of originality and their deceptive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

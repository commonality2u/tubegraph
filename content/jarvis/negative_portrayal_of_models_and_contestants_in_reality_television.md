The reality television show *America's Most Smartest Model* is critiqued for its negative portrayal of models and contestants, employing stereotypes and mean-spirited challenges. The show, which aired for a single season on VH1, aims to determine if attractive models can also be intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This premise is immediately deemed "stupid" due to its inherent bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Show Format and Intent

*America's Most Smartest Model* features 16 models who are asked to be both beautiful and smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The show is compared to a combination of *America's Next Top Model* and *Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Contestants endure "strange challenges" that mix modeling with trivia, such as a spelling bee with foreign fashion brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> or a runway walk requiring contestants to list types of trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

However, these challenges are criticized for not genuinely testing intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Instead, the show frequently resorts to [[discussion_on_toxic_dynamics_and_bullying_in_reality_TV | body shaming]] and shaming the models' intelligence, making it a "very shameful show that's based on being mean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The recurring themes of the show are meanness and the overuse of stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Host Behavior and Bias

The show employs two hosts: Mary Alice Stevenson for "beauty" and Ben Stein for "brains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Ben Stein, known for his role as a boring teacher in *Ferris Bueller's Day Off* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, is introduced as the "smart guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

However, Ben Stein's portrayal is heavily criticized:
*   He is depicted as "constantly fawning over the female contestants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, with a "creepy old guy bit" that is described as "nasty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> and "gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   He is referred to as a "slimy little troll" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   His comments to contestants are often inappropriate and demeaning, such as asking a female contestant "how much do you weigh?" on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, or suggesting "nipples" as an answer for "things that are round" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

The judges overall are described as "mean" and "evil," making the show a "bummer to watch sometimes" due to everyone trying to be "the Simon Cowell of the show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. They are portrayed as "demons that feed off of breaking the spirit of these young hopeful models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Negative Treatment and Stereotypes of Contestants

Contestants are frequently subjected to harsh judgment and stereotypical portrayals:

*   **Intelligence Shaming:** Knowledge of random trivia has no bearing on actual intelligence, despite the show's premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **[[critiques_on_reality_tv_show_formats_and_stereotypes | Stereotypes]] and [[dramatization_and_editing_in_reality_TV | Editing]]:**
    *   Models are made to appear "extremely cocky" through editing, fitting a stereotype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   A contestant with ADHD is consistently edited to seem "off the walls" and "completely unaware of his surroundings," which is called an "unfair" and "dumb stereotype" and "a little ableist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **[[discussion_on_toxic_dynamics_and_bullying_in_reality_TV | Body Shaming]]:**
    *   One male contestant is told he needs to "lose some weight" and "tone up that center," despite having a "perfectly normal and beautiful body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This is presented as an example of "unrealistic beauty standards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Targeting Specific Contestants:**
    *   **Mandy Lynn:** As a former Playboy and lingerie model who had posed nude, she is constantly called a "porn star" by other contestants and the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This is seen as a mean attempt to "chop her down based on the way that she presents herself and looks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. She is also told to "scrub off your makeup" and "change the color of your hair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Her runway walk is criticized as "too sexy" or "like she's having sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
    *   **Gaston:** An Argentinian contestant, Gaston, is portrayed negatively due to his inappropriate sexual comments towards women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The show's producers are criticized for playing into this behavior and continually showing these clips, rather than simply eliminating him, suggesting an exploitation of his character for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. He is also made to spell "nincompoop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, mocking his non-native English speaking.
    *   **Andre:** A "Russian bad boy" who takes the show both too seriously and not seriously at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, Andre introduces himself as being from the "Soviet Union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. He brags about his expensive lifestyle and believes models are "gods and goddesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Despite his confidence, he performs poorly in challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   **Lack of Camaraderie:** Unlike shows such as [[critique_of_the_bachelor_as_a_television_show | The Bachelor]], there is "no camaraderie" or "sense of community" among contestants; instead, "everyone is just at each other's neck at all times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Contestants are "catty to one another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Eliminations:** Two people are eliminated within the first five minutes without clear reason, potentially to "break down as many people's self-confidence as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

## Production Manipulation and [[the_concept_of_exploitation_and_reality_TV | Exploitation]]

The article highlights how producers manipulate narratives and exploit contestants for drama:
*   Contestants are not in control of their own narratives or how they are edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   Producers likely highly influence actions and statements on the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   The casting of problematic individuals like Gaston, and the continuous airing of their offensive behavior, is seen as a deliberate choice for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   The show locks access to bathrooms and the refrigerator behind trivia questions, which is considered a "human rights violation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   Some challenges are deemed unfair, particularly for non-American contestants who may not know U.S. history trivia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   Words in the spelling bee are sometimes chosen specifically to mock contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

Overall, the show is described as "really mean and really like indicative...of what reality television was like in 2007" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>, where producers could say anything, but it is "fun to watch because it's so horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

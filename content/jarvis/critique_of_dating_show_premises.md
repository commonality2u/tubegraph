Netflix, once a source of original content, has transitioned to traditional media, with a notable shift towards dating shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. A common feature of these shows is the "twist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Examples of Dating Show Premises

### [[the_concept_and_criticism_of_love_is_blind_as_a_dating_show | Love Is Blind]]
This show features contestants getting engaged without seeing each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. It captivated audiences due to its unique premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Too Hot to Handle
This Netflix dating show prevents contestants from engaging in sexual touch, including kissing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The show implies that by removing the sense of touch sexually, deeper connections can be formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The premise often leads to satirical speculation about future dating shows removing other senses, such as "Love is Stinky," where singles rely on their sense of smell while living on a "trash island" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Criticisms of Premises

### Unclear Rules and Objectives
The core premise of "Too Hot to Handle" is often unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While there is a $100,000 prize, it is not clear if it's awarded to one person, multiple people, or a couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The prize is vaguely stated to be awarded to "the people who show the most growth," which is later suggested to be untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The rules regarding how the prize money works are never clearly explained, which is a major problem if the audience is expected to care about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

### Superficiality of the "Deeper Connection" Theme
Many dating shows, including "Too Hot to Handle" and [[the_concept_and_criticism_of_love_is_blind_as_a_dating_show | Love Is Blind]], often present the premise that dating apps make it difficult to build genuine relationships because value is judged by a photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. "Too Hot to Handle" is heavy-handed in its assertion that contestants are "commitment-phobic," only care about sex, and have never experienced genuine connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

However, the show is criticized for not genuinely exploring deeper themes. It presents the idea of "sexual rehabilitation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, but the transcript suggests it isn't interested in a valid and interesting conversation about sex and love addiction, which is a real struggle for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

### Exaggerated Personalities and Lack of Authenticity
Contestants on the show are portrayed with singular, exaggerated traits, such as Chloe being depicted as "dumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> or Charan being defined by his "giant shlong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> and later, his "feminist" trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This leads to the impression that producers might be behind the scenes telling them what to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> and that contestants might be "bad actors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

### Inconsistent Pacing and Rule Enforcement
The show's pacing is erratic, with concepts and rules introduced at seemingly random times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The passage of time within the show is unclear, making it difficult for the audience to relate to the characters' feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. Eliminations also occur without clear criteria or explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

### Undermining the Premise at the Conclusion
Despite the premise of a prize for "growth" and abstaining from sexual contact to form meaningful relationships, the show ends with everyone winning and splitting the remaining prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. This outcome is questioned as it negates the concept of restraint or rule-following, as a contestant who adhered to the rules (Kells) received the same financial outcome as those who frequently broke them (Harry and Francesca) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. This suggests that the show rewards those who "hog it all for yourself" rather than sharing or showing collective growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. The show's self-congratulatory tone about the contestants' "growth" is also critiqued, given that the filming period was only about a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

The platform TikTok, which originated as a "string of ones and zeros typed at random by a team of monkeys," has become a significant force in online content, where users often engage in various antics to achieve popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The pursuit of online notoriety on TikTok can lead to extreme behaviors, particularly in the realm of pranks.

## TikTok's Prank Culture

While some believe that TikTok's popularity requires no talent or creativity, as many users imitate well-known songs and comedy bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, others argue there is nuance and interesting content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. However, TikTok pranks specifically are often seen as lacking creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. These pranks range from fake to real, and sometimes a combination of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Jackson O'Doherty and Kristen Hanby: The "Challenge" Pranks

Two Australian content creators, Jackson O'Doherty and Kristen Hanby, are prominent figures in TikTok's prank scene, specializing in what they call "prank-challenges" or "challenge-pranks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Their videos typically feature one friend saying a random phrase, like "get rid of it," to the other, who then reacts with feigned surprise but immediately understands the action required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This often results in a public disturbance, such as throwing a freshly made Subway sandwich on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. The repeated nature of these pranks, with the "pranked" individual always acting surprised, suggests a premeditated agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

The motivation behind these acts appears to be [[youth_motivation_and_social_media_clout | clout chasing]], with the individual acting as if they are under a "cloud chasing version of the Imperius curse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. While O'Doherty and Hanby have a significant presence on TikTok, they are even more prominent on Instagram, where they often "flex" their lifestyle and feature videos not found on TikTok, including harassing people while in jockstraps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Their success has led to [[the_rise_of_similar_youtube_channels | numerous imitators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

### Michael Fallon TV: "Comedian" Prankster

Another notable TikTok prankster is Michael Fallon TV, who identifies as a comedian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. His content includes sketches like "when you pick up a disabled hitchhiker," which is deemed too offensive to show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. His pranks are often titled humorously, such as "that friend who's always on their phone... not anymore," which involves throwing a friend's phone into oncoming traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

Fallon also creates "dare or get slapped" videos, where he is dared to perform an obnoxious public act and immediately complies, such as riding a bike into a river or acting like a monkey on a table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. The rapid reaction time from hearing the dare to performing it, such as "zero to monkey at 1.28 seconds," is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. The observer questions the purpose of these actions, asking, "What does he gain? What does he get?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

## The Cost of Online Fame

Creating a "good" prank is challenging, as it requires balancing between being too extreme (harassment) and too mild (boring) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. Real-world consequences for pranks can be severe; for instance, college students were suspended for sending a harmless April Fool's email impersonating a dean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

Despite these risks, many individuals are willing to engage in dangerous or disruptive behavior for the potential reward of "five TikTok followers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. This drive is a key aspect of [[impact_of_social_media_on_public_perception_of_success | social media's impact on public perception of success]] and [[youth_motivation_and_social_media_clout | youth motivation]].

Other examples of pranks driven by the search for internet fame include:

*   **Raw Pasta Cracking**: Chewing raw pasta in public to create a loud cracking sound, making people think bones are cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.
*   **Loud Music Over Intercoms**: Playing music, such as "Hit or Miss," over store intercoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>, potentially risking an employee's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. This reflects [[audience_engagement_and_internet_humor | internet humor]] pushing boundaries.
*   **Fake Crimes**: Staged "crimes" like robbing a bank, often accompanied by hashtags such as #featureme or #haha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>. This highlights how [[brands_seeking_clout_and_attention | brands and individuals seek clout and attention]].
*   **Dangerous Home Pranks**: Pranks involving household items that could cause harm, such as appearing to murder a sibling with raw pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>, or attempting to "prank" a roommate with hot oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>.

The pervasive nature of these pranks and the underlying motivation suggest a deep desire for "that sweet sweet dopamine" hit that comes with online engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>, contributing to the broader [[impact_of_online_fame_and_popularity_on_content_creation | impact of online fame on content creation]].

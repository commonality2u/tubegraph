The virginity of the lead, particularly [[narrative_analysis_of_matt_james_as_the_bachelor | Colton Underwood]], has been a significant and frequently discussed plot point within [[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]] franchise. This aspect was heavily emphasized by [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | producers]] and became a central theme of his season.

## Colton Underwood: The Virgin Bachelor
Colton Underwood, who starred in the 23rd season of [[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]], was prominently described as an ex-NFL player, although he "didn't really play in games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:03">[02:03:03]</a>. His "other main attribute" highlighted by the show was his virginity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. This fact was continuously brought up throughout the season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. The show repeatedly featured soundbites of people discussing his virginity, such as "I am a virgin" and "I am the first a virgin bachelor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

The emphasis on his virginity was so pervasive that the show's premiere watch party included a segment where attendees speculated if he might "lose something along the way," culminating in the reveal that they were referring to "his virginity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

## Contestant Reactions and Strategies
Contestants on the show were aware of Colton's virginity, and some leveraged it as part of their strategy to stand out or connect with him.

Examples include:
*   A contestant stating, "I have not dated a virgin since I was 12" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, which was later echoed by another during their introduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   One contestant remarked that having a "virgin bachelor is super appealing" to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
*   A contestant introduced herself with a "pop your cherry" metaphor, presenting him with what appeared to be a strawberry, which was deemed a "violent metaphor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
*   Another contestant dressed as a sloth, explaining she likes to "take things slow," a clear reference to Colton's virginity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## Production and Narrative Framing
The [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | producers]] actively emphasized Colton's virginity as the "main plot point" of the season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. This decision distilled Colton into a "hot plus football plus virgin" persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. The show is known for manufacturing drama and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>, and Colton's virginity served as a key narrative device to create intrigue and keep viewers engaged. The season trailer, for instance, dramatically teased Colton jumping a fence, framed as a significant event, likely tied to the resolution of his virginity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>.

This incident led to widespread public discussion and revealed various perceptions regarding the security and trustworthiness of such platforms.

## The 2020 Twitter Hack
On July 15, 2020, [[Twitter hacking incident and its implications | Twitter]] experienced a "gigantic hack" where scammers gained control of the world's most influential [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | Twitter accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. These compromised accounts, belonging to world leaders (like Barack Obama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>), entertainers (Kanye West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>), brands, and companies, were used to tweet a Bitcoin scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The scam promised to double any Bitcoin sent to a specific, untraceable address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Public Reaction and Impact
The immediate public reaction to the hack ranged from disbelief to frustration:
*   **"2020 is broken"**: A common sentiment reflecting the year's unusual events, with the hack adding to a sense of things "going wrong in succession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **"Twitter is a bad website"**: Many, including the speaker, concluded that [[Twitter hacking incident and its implications | Twitter]] was fundamentally flawed due to its vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Silenced Voices**: For a few hours, [[Twitter | Twitter]] disabled tweeting for all verified accounts, preventing users from sharing their "hot takes" on the unfolding situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Financial Loss**: Approximately 400 individuals were scammed out of over $100,000, revealing a significant trust in the compromised accounts, despite the common wisdom that "if something seems too good to be true, it is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The public nature of Bitcoin transactions made these losses visible, eliciting sadness for those who hoped to double their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Concern over broader [[Social Media Algorithms and Misinformation | impact]]**: There was a recognition that the perpetrators, with the power to tweet from any account, could have caused much greater damage, such as manipulating stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Perceptions of Corporate Responsibility and Security
The incident sparked strong criticism of [[Twitter | Twitter]]'s security measures and leadership:
*   **Leadership Scrutiny**: Questions were raised about the effectiveness of [[Twitter | Twitter]]'s CEO, who also helmed another company, suggesting a lack of dedicated focus on the platform's security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Internal Vulnerabilities**: Early reports suggested [[the_use_of_social_engineering_in_cybersecurity_breaches | social engineering]] was at play, implying an insider at [[Twitter | Twitter]] was either tricked or paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This led to public astonishment that a [[Twitter | Twitter]] employee could access and tweet from influential accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Historical Precedents**: Critics pointed to past incidents, such as a support staff deleting Donald Trump's account in protest years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, and instances where [[Twitter | Twitter]] secrets were stolen and reported to foreign governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. These events indicated that [[Twitter | Twitter]] had received "enough warnings and trial runs" to prevent such a large-scale breach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Industry Standards**: The incident highlighted a perceived failure to adopt security practices common among more established tech companies, where access to user accounts is heavily protected to prevent rogue employee actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Examples like Google employees spying on search history or Uber's "god mode" tool were cited as evidence that these lessons should have already been learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Transparency Issues**: [[Twitter | Twitter]]'s decision to suspend users who tweeted screenshots of the internal tool, presumably to avoid looking bad, also drew public attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

The incident underscored a widely held public perception that social media companies, especially mature public ones, have a responsibility to invest adequately in infrastructure and user protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

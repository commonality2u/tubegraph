From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Among the various food hacks reviewed, one involves using a razor blade to cut strawberries, presented by [[tiktok_cooking_hacks | TikTok cooking hack]] creator "Getty" as a "factor cap" game, meaning it's either a fact or a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

## The Hack's Premise

The core idea of this hack is to avoid traditional methods of cutting strawberries. It involves placing a razor blade inside one strawberry, then putting that "bladed" strawberry into a bowl with other whole strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. The bowl is then shaken, and the razor blade is supposedly meant to ricochet through the container, magically dicing all the strawberries within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

The host of the video noted that Getty's demonstration appeared to magically dice the strawberries perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

### Practicality Concerns

Despite the apparent "magic," the host questioned the practicality, suggesting that even if the hack worked, chopping strawberries with a knife would likely be cleaner and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. The host also observed that the bowl in Getty's video ended up full of strawberry juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

## Attempting the Hack

The host decided to attempt the hack, using washed strawberries, German-engineered double-edged razor blades, and a tupperware container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. Adhering to the instructions, a single razor blade was inserted into one of the strawberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>.

### Safety Advisory

[[safety_in_attempting_diy_life_hacks | Safety in attempting DIY life hacks]] was a significant concern for the host. The act of putting a razor blade into food goes against typical safety advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. The host explicitly stated, "Don't try this at home. No one should try this anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>, and later added, "I'm gonna put a number of cautions on this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. Tossing a razor blade around in a container was noted as stressful, with potential for things to go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

## Results and Conclusion

The host's attempt involved shaking the container for about a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>, but the razor blade became stuck to the top of the tupperware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. As a result, the strawberries remained uncut, except for the one that already had the blade inserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. The host admitted forgetting to perform the "spin technique" seen in Getty's video, which might have been a factor in the failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.

After the attempt, the host questioned whether all the razor blades had been removed before consuming any of the strawberries, highlighting the inherent danger of the hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.

A trend of [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media|viral food hacks]] involving toilets has emerged, primarily featuring a creator known as "the Anna Show" or "the toilet lady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This content is a follow-up to a previous video titled "wasting food for clout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The source of these toilet-based videos has been identified as Rick Lax, specifically through his "Magic Show" on Snapchat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Toilet-Based Food Hacks

### Neapolitan Ice Cream Punch
One prominent example of a [[TikTok cooking hacks|TikTok cooking hack]] using a toilet is a DIY punch trick for parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This involves:
*   Adding ice to the toilet bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   Placing Neapolitan ice cream into the icy toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   Pouring Hawaiian Punch into the toilet's back tank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Flushing the toilet, which causes the punch to fill the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

The creator, Anna, describes herself as "bartending" with this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Despite claims of cleaning the toilet, the bowl often appears stained and "bacterial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Chocolate Milkshake
Another toilet-based food creation is a chocolate milkshake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The process includes:
*   Clogging the toilet with a "brown burrito sandbag" or "bundle of clothes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   Spiraling chocolate sauce and whipped cream into the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   Pouring "gallons of milk" into the toilet's back tank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   Adding sprinkles and cherries to the mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   Flushing the toilet to mix the contents, despite a toilet not being a blender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

Anna suggests that mixing in "a little bit of water" (implying toilet water) makes the milkshake "extra creamy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. The videos often show multiple straws inserted, suggesting it's for shared consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

## Other Toilet-Related Content

Beyond food, Anna has also featured non-food related "hacks" using toilets, such as washing hair in the toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Shampoo is poured into the back tank, and the toilet is flushed to "wash" the hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This content often originates from the "Magic Show" on Snapchat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Motivation Behind the Videos

These videos are primarily created for "outrage clicks and views," generating "tons of money" from the public's reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The theory that these videos are for a fetish aspect is largely dismissed due to a lack of proof, with the motivation clearly being financial gain through virality and clout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. These are staged acts, not genuine everyday practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Broader Content Strategy

Anna is a prolific creator who has "picked up the [[TikTok and duckrelated content|TikTok]] game" and gained significant popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Her content extends beyond toilet hacks to include:
*   [[TikTok pranks and trends|Prank videos]]: Such as a "Tinder date" prank where she alters her appearance after a sleepover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   Other [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media|food hacks]]: Like one involving ground beef molded around Velveeta cheese, which also gained significant viral attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. This type of content, along with the toilet hacks, falls under the "Rick Lax Productions umbrella" of creating gross-out food hacks for clout, often wasting food in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

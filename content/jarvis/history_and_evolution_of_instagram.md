Recently, many users have expressed frustration with Instagram, primarily because the app, which was originally focused on photos, is now trying to emulate [[influence_of_apps_like_tiktok_on_instagram | TikTok]] [00:00:05]. This trend extends beyond Instagram, with YouTube and Facebook also adopting vertical video feeds that often recycle content originating from TikTok [00:00:10]. Instagram's significant push towards video is seen by some as "destroying the fabric of our universe" [00:00:41].

## Early Days and Core Features

Instagram began in 2010 as a mobile check-in application, similar to Foursquare [00:01:36]. To avoid direct competition with Foursquare, the app pivoted to focus on photo sharing [00:01:44]. The breakthrough moment for Instagram came when co-founder Kevin Systrom realized the need for photo filters, inspired by his wife's hesitation to post photos due to perceived quality issues [00:01:54]. The addition of filters was pivotal, leading to the birth of a "billion-dollar company" [00:02:18].

## Acquisition by Facebook and Feature Copying

Just two years after its inception, in 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram for $1 billion [00:02:27]. After Instagram's original founders departed, the app began to increasingly resemble Facebook [00:02:41]. Facebook, often likened to the "Drake of social media," uses Instagram to stay relevant by acquiring or copying features from smaller platforms [00:02:56].

The $1 billion acquisition price, while significant at the time, is now considered a "steal" [00:03:08]. For context, Faze Clan is reportedly worth more than Instagram was at the time of its acquisition, and Elon Musk offered to buy Twitter for approximately $50 billion [00:03:24]. Around the same time, Facebook also attempted to acquire Snapchat for $3 billion [00:03:39].

Instagram has a history of [[competition_and_feature_copying_by_instagram | feature copying]]:
*   **Vine**: Facebook created a 15-second looping video feature to compete with Vine [00:03:56].
*   **Snapchat**: Instagram implemented disappearing messages and famously "stole" Snapchat Stories, which significantly impacted Snapchat's user base [00:04:13]. The decline of Snapchat was influenced by these changes [00:10:30].
*   **BeReal**: Instagram is currently testing a dual camera feature similar to BeReal [00:04:30].
*   **TikTok**: This is not Instagram's first attempt to copy TikTok. Facebook previously launched a standalone TikTok clone app called Lasso, which failed [00:04:50]. Subsequently, Instagram integrated Reels, which has now replaced all video uploads, forcing users to convert their videos into Reels [00:05:04]. The presence of a dedicated Reels tab, featuring recycled TikToks, mirrors YouTube Shorts [00:05:21].

## [[reactions_to_instagrams_algorithm_and_feature_changes | User and Creator Backlash]]

The current push towards Reels has generated significant [[reactions_to_instagrams_algorithm_and_feature_changes | backlash]], notably amplified when influential figures like Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian shared a post from artist Tati Bruening [00:05:31]. The post stated, "Make Instagram Instagram Again," and called for a movement to bring back the old Instagram, linking to a Change.org petition [00:05:47].

The petition garnered approximately 2 million likes and 300,000 signatures but ultimately failed to sway Instagram's direction [00:06:12]. Critics of the petition argue that while the complaints are valid, the expectation that Instagram would revert based on a petition is "silly" and "corny" [00:06:06].

One of the primary complaints in the petition is the desire for chronological timelines, allowing users to see posts from their friends in order [00:06:48]. This is a recurring criticism that platforms like Twitter and Facebook have faced when shifting to algorithmic feeds [00:07:09]. However, the petition's claim that early Instagram fostered "living in the moment" and seeing "best moments in real time" is disputed, as Instagram has always been a "vain vanity app" where users presented curated versions of themselves [00:07:03].

Influencers, including the Kardashians, have significant financial incentives tied to Instagram, as it is a platform where they engage in sponsorships [00:07:42].

### Impact on Creators and Engagement

The [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | impact of Instagram's changes]] on users and creators, particularly photographers, has been substantial [00:12:12]. The shifting algorithm makes it harder for creators to reach their audience [00:12:33]. Photographers, for instance, now find that their work is deprioritized if it doesn't fit into the Reels format, forcing them to adapt to the new video-centric program [00:12:43].

A personal tally of an Instagram feed showed that 50% of posts were Reels, significantly reducing the space for traditional photos [00:13:23]. Of these Reels, 80% were "suggested" content from accounts not followed by the user, rather than content from friends [00:13:57]. This decision directly and dramatically impacts creators [00:14:39]. Content creators on YouTube, for example, would feel similar emotional distress if their long-form video content was suddenly deprioritized in favor of Shorts [00:14:46]. Many photographers feel they shouldn't have to create "cringy reels" for their art to be seen [00:15:58].

## Instagram's Official Stance

Instagram, aware of the backlash, responded through its CEO, Adam Mosseri, in what was perceived as "maximum damage control" [00:16:16].

Mosseri addressed several concerns:
*   **Full-screen feed test**: He confirmed that a full-screen feed, for both videos and photos, is a test designed to be a "more fun, engaging experience" [00:17:29]. He acknowledged that the current test isn't "good yet" but implied it's a direction they want to move in [00:19:10].
*   **Photos vs. Video**: Mosseri stated that Instagram would "continue to support photos" as part of its heritage [00:19:28]. However, he also honestly admitted that "more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time," citing a natural shift in user behavior and consumption habits due to improved bandwidth and internet access [00:19:43].
*   **Recommendations**: These are posts from accounts users don't follow, aimed at helping users "discover new and interesting things" [00:22:10]. While this can be beneficial for discovery (e.g., YouTube recommendations), on Instagram, it "ruffle[s] the feathers" of users who came to the app for a different reason [00:23:03]. Users can hide or snooze recommendations [00:23:23], or switch to a "following feed," but this feed cannot be set as the default [00:23:53].

Mosseri's messaging is largely seen as PR-approved talking points to justify changes already in motion [00:20:57]. Critics argue that by making 50% of the feed video, Instagram is "putting [its] thumb on the scale" to increase engagement and time spent on the app, as watching videos takes longer than viewing photos [00:21:15].

## Underlying Motivations

Instagram's strategic shifts are primarily driven by the "profit motive" and the desire to maximize profitability for shareholders [00:28:08]. The company sees a "huge opportunity" in video content, particularly in response to the [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | success of TikTok]] [00:28:24]. Instagram has "no allegiance to its users," only to financial gain [00:28:31]. If cooking videos, for example, proved to be the most profitable path, Instagram would shift its focus accordingly [00:28:41].

New users are constantly joining Instagram, and the longer they can be "hooked" on the app, the more valuable they become [00:29:19]. Casual users who dislike the changes and leave are considered less valuable than those who become "addicted to Reels" and consume Instagram like television [00:29:32].

The "Reels experiment" appears to be working for Instagram, leading to increased engagement, suggesting these changes are likely permanent [00:29:58]. Creators often feel beholden to platforms and their algorithms to grow their brand [00:30:31]. While the impact on photo creators is regrettable, the future may see new applications emerge that allow for alternative forms of self-expression [00:31:15].

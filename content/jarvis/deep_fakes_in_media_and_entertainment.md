Deep fakes are a form of synthetic media that have gained significant attention due to their realistic depiction of individuals in fabricated scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These digitally altered videos and images can be both entertaining and concerning, prompting discussions about their [[risks_and_concerns_of_deep_fake_usage | risks and concerns]] and the need for increased public awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## [[understanding_deep_fakes | Understanding Deep Fakes]]

A deep fake is a synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The [[the_technology_behind_deep_fakes | technology behind deep fakes]] utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and a large collection of photographs and references of the target person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For example, to create a deep fake of Tom Cruise, numerous images of him from various angles and vantage points are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Famous people, like movie stars, are often easier to deep fake because there is an abundance of source material available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Notable Deep Fake Examples

Deep fakes have appeared in the news for both harmful and comedic reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### The Viral Tom Cruise TikTok Videos
One of the most notable examples to go viral recently was a series of deep fake videos featuring Tom Cruise on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. These videos, posted by an account named "Deep Tom Cruise," were highly convincing, leading many to believe they were real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The videos depicted Tom Cruise doing everyday activities like golfing or eating a lollipop, often with unusual or "kooky" behavior that aligns with some public perceptions of the actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The creators purposefully flexed the technology by having the deep fake eat a lollipop and get close to the camera, which are typically challenging movements to render accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Other Entertainment Examples
*   **Harry Styles TikTok Sketch:** A TikTok sketch featuring a deep fake of Harry Styles also gained traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Bill Hader Deep Fakes:** A YouTube channel called "Control Shift Face" created eerie deep fakes of Bill Hader seamlessly transforming into different celebrities like Tom Cruise, Seth Rogen, and Arnold Schwarzenegger while telling stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This video, dating back to 2019, shows how convincing deep fakes can be with fewer resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Creation and Accessibility

The viral Tom Cruise deep fakes were created by Chris Ume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. His process for these specific videos involved hiring one of the world's best Tom Cruise impersonators and took months to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Despite the intensive production for these high-quality fakes, the technology is not inaccessible to the average person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Many random YouTube users are already creating convincing deep fakes with significantly fewer resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The core concept involves superimposing a target person's face onto every frame of an existing video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

Furthermore, deep fake technology extends beyond video to audio, with research being done to create deep fakes for voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The combination of audio and video deep fakes means that "nothing is real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## [[risks_and_concerns_of_deep_fake_usage | Risks and Concerns of Deep Fake Usage]]

Deep fakes pose several [[risks_and_concerns_of_deep_fake_usage | risks and concerns]]:

*   **Malicious Use:** Historically, deep fakes have been used for "bad reasons," such as placing someone's likeness into lewd videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Cyber Harassment:** A real-world example includes a Pennsylvania woman accused of doctoring photos and videos of her daughter's cheerleading rivals to get them kicked off the squad, leading to misdemeanor counts of cyber harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Trust and "Fake News":** Deep fakes exploit the fact that people cannot critically evaluate every piece of information they encounter online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Seemingly inconsequential deep fakes, like Tom Cruise golfing, can be an "insidious foot in the door" to more dangerous fabricated content that confirms existing worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### [[regulation_and_ethical_implications_of_deep_fakes | Regulation and Ethical Implications of Deep Fakes]]
Platforms like TikTok have implemented policies regarding deep fakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. For instance, TikTok removed an account that was deep faking Charli D'Amelio because the creator was trying to impersonate her, whereas the Tom Cruise deep fake was allowed because it was clear it was a deep fake and not an impersonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. The unauthorized use of someone's likeness in a deep fake can be considered a breach of privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Public Perception and Awareness

Despite the growing capabilities of deep fake technology, some members of the public remain skeptical or dismissive. Comments on articles about deep fakes often show people claiming they were not fooled, asserting the deep fakes don't look real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. However, when a deep fake is paused, it's often a photo of the actual person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The "uncanny valley" effect makes the motion look unnatural, allowing some to identify it as fake, but many people won't notice, especially when casually scrolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

Expecting every individual to critically assess the authenticity of all online content is unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. It is crucial for society to be aware of what is possible with this technology and to avoid believing everything seen online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Many people are still unaware of deep fakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, and there's a bias where those who were fooled are less likely to admit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. This creates a "slippery slope" where the lack of awareness can lead to greater issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

A new "podcasting Renaissance" has emerged, characterized by creators broadcasting what some consider "terrible opinions," particularly concerning women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This trend has reached a "boiling point" with shows like *Fresh & Fit* and *Whatever* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Case Study: Fresh & Fit Podcast

The *Fresh & Fit* podcast is described as being "about calling women dumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. It [[Criticism of podcasts like Fresh and Fit and Whatever | revolutionized the misogyny podcast format]] by bringing on 10 women to talk over, rather than just two men conversing amongst themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The hosts frequently ask women leading questions about promiscuity and inquire if they would give up Instagram for a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. They also pose questions about whether women's dating standards are realistic or delusional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. If women disagree with the host or if he is simply in a bad mood, they are "kicked off the show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Host Myron has supercuts dedicated to him getting emotional and removing women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The podcast is often filmed at night, features women of color, and is hosted by two Black men, Myron and Fresh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Case Study: The Whatever Podcast

In contrast to *Fresh & Fit*, *The Whatever Podcast* is typically filmed during the day, features fewer guests of color, and is hosted by a white man named Brian (who stylizes his name as "Brixton") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This shift is humorously referred to as "gentrifying misogyny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Format and Host Behavior

*The Whatever Podcast* shares a similar format, featuring a panel of "entirely too many guests" and asking "incredibly original and hard-hitting questions" like "what is your body count?" or "would you give up Instagram for a man?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The host, Brian, is described as "grumbl[ing] meekly" and looking off-screen for reassurance, unlike the more assertive hosts of *Fresh & Fit* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. His co-host is a sex doll named Kiki, which Brian introduces as "a bit shy" in every episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

The show often discusses traditional values and perceived male suffering, such as the military draft, with reaction shots of women giving blank stares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The host's questions can be controlling, such as asking if a woman would give up going to bars, clubs, and parties for a man who would "never cheat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Underlying Worldview and Insecurity

This worldview is rooted in insecurity, where the host believes that if a girlfriend receives attention from other men, the response should be to control her access to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The belief is that if a partner says they won't cheat, they are "lying" and "always looking to cheat," necessitating "mitigat[ing] risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This reveals a fundamental lack of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The host also makes self-pitying statements, such as how men are ignored in bars while women are always hit on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. The show often feels like the host describing his negative experiences with women and seeking validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

### Guests and Agenda

The show's guests often include OnlyFans models and college students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, who are frequently brought on to debate a "Chase" â€“ a conservative content creator who debates the guests on behalf of the host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. The show has featured guests who defend domestic abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. While the casting call describes the podcast as being about "modern dating and relationships," it clearly has an agenda, despite the host denying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

Some guests, particularly OnlyFans models, use the show as an opportunity for "good conversion" for their platforms, while others come on to "debunk the show" and expose the host's "shaky values" and "inconsistent" talking points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### [[Audience interaction and influence on podcast content | Audience Interaction and Monetization]]

The show is live-streamed, allowing for real-time "women hating" in the chat and through donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. The chat often praises men with "w man Big W Chad" and spams "dumb lady bad lady" or "304" (a code word for "hoe") when women speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. The host often laughs at or supports these comments for a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

Viewers spend hundreds of dollars to "virtually cat call and heckle women" and engage in ongoing conversations with the panel, sometimes even asking women to rate their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. This fosters a community where "lost men are hating on women that they privately seek the approved love or publicly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

### Reception and Impact

The podcast itself is described as "boring" with "no one seems to be having a good time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. The host, Brian, is called the "most reluctant misogyny profiteer" and seems unconvinced by his own rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. He lacks charisma compared to *Fresh & Fit* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

[[Audience impact and reception of inspirational content | Brian's own audience is starting to turn on him]] for "not being masculine enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. This content appears to be a "cash grab," given Brian's prior history of making prank videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

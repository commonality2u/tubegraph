This article discusses the emerging trend of content on YouTube, particularly targeting preteen audiences, that features homophobic narratives, often disguised as "challenges" or "potions" from the dark web. It highlights how these videos perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to negative [[the_issue_of_inappropriate_childrens_content_on_youtube | children's content]] online.

## The Rise of Problematic Kids' Content

While traditional discussions around [[the_issue_of_inappropriate_childrens_content_on_youtube | children's content on YouTube]] often focus on the youngest demographic (e.g., YouTube Kids, educational animations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, there's a growing concern about content aimed at "preteens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Despite a technical age limit of 13 for regular YouTube, many younger children access the platform by lying about their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This creates an environment where creators attempt to "squeeze the ad dollars" out of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, leading to concerning sub-genres.

## The "3 AM Challenge" and JayStation

An entire sub-genre exists to "creep kids out," exemplified by "3 a.m. Challenge" videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Examples include "Barney is haunted" or "Calling Barney on FaceTime at 3 a.m." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. A notable creator in this niche is JayStation, whose "entire brand is creeping out kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> with content featuring characters like Freddy Krueger, Mike Myers, and Cookie Monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. One video even features a claim to talk to the spirit of Mac Miller, described as "the most disrespectful sh*t on the planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## The "Gay Potion" Trend

A new and particularly problematic trend involves creators "pretending to order magic potions from the dark web" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The "dark web" serves as a stand-in for a "creepy Internet place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. These videos claim the potions grant "creepy or magical powers like shape-shifting or teleporting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Homophobic Content and Stereotypes

A specific video, "we kissed or during gay potion from the dark web at 3 a.m.", is highlighted as "mega homophobic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> because its premise suggests "being gay is like spooky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The core premise of the "gay potion" is that drinking it will "turn anybody gay for exactly one hour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The creator questions why, given the ability to pretend any power (e.g., super strength, mind-reading), the most "compelling thing" they could think of was "turning gay for one hour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

The videos are permeated with the creators' repeated declarations of being "straight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, and the overall premise "hinges on systemic homophobia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Notably, JayStation, one of the creators, is identified as a "full-grown adult" at 28 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, not a misguided teen.

The videos depict grossly stereotypical "gay impressions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, portraying gay people with "a little weird" vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> and engaging in "non-consensual touching" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This includes one character reacting as if seeing a monster after an unasked-for kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Stereotypes extend to portraying gay people as putting on lipstick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> and later even using stereotypes about women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The content implies that "being gay doesn't mean you just make out with whatever dude is in kissing range" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Continuation and Escalation

The "gay potion" videos are part of a series, with later installments involving Kermit the Frog. In one instance, Kermit is portrayed as holding JayStation's channel hostage, forcing him to drink the "gay potion" to get it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The videos depict the same "exactly the same things happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a> as in previous gay potion videos. The series culminates with JayStation agreeing to "kiss a puppet sensually" for 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a> while Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. The final video even ends with a remix of Alex Jones' "turned the frogs gay" quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, which is the only self-aware moment in the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

A spin-off video by J Hills involves mixing "the baby and gay potion from the dark web" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, further highlighting the creators' lack of understanding about the identities they mock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

### Audience Reaction and Creator Motivation

The comments section of these videos reveals that the audience consists of people "disgusted with J Station" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a> and children who might believe the content is real or are confused by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. Comments include "I literally spit out my water but also offended because it's homophobic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a> and "is Kermit the Frog real?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

The primary motivation for such content appears to be [[monetization_and_sponsorship_in_controversial_content | monetization]] and "clout chasing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. The J Hills video, for example, features five mid-roll ads in a ten-minute video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. The speaker criticizes this as a "clear money grab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

### Consequences and the Need for Better Representation

The problem is described as "clout chasing with ignorance" multiplied by the internet, which "can cause real pain for people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. While creators may claim the videos are "meant to be entertaining and... all in good fun," it is emphasized that if it's "at the expense of a marginalized group, maybe just don't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

The speaker highlights the importance of positive media representation for LGBTQ+ individuals and advocates for "anything that makes kids or adults feel less alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Examples of media with positive depictions of LGBTQ+ people include "The Bright Sessions" (a fiction podcast) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a> and YouTubers like Jackson Byrd, It's Radish Time, Asante B, and Rowan Ellis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. This stance is presented not as a "political statement" or "SJW thing" but as a fundamental desire for inclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

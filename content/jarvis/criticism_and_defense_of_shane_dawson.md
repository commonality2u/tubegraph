From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Making a video discussing the "Shane situation" is acknowledged as a conflicted and scary endeavor due to Shane Dawson's large and defensive fanbase [00:00:09] and the potential for opening oneself up to backlash [00:00:24]. However, the purpose of discussing [[Shane Dawsons controversial past and apologies | Shane Dawson's controversial past]] is not to brand him as a "monster" [00:00:30]. By all accounts, including those from his friends and mutual acquaintances, he is described as a well-meaning individual committed to learning and growing from his past mistakes [00:00:32].

The video aims to address observed gaps in [[Shane Dawsons controversial past and apologies | Shane's past apologies]], his audience's misunderstanding of criticisms against him, and broader gaps in the YouTube discourse surrounding him [00:00:46]. It is explicitly stated that this is not a call for deplatforming or "cancel culture"; rather, the belief is that Shane, commanding a large audience, has the power to use his past mistakes to educate his viewers, helping the YouTube community move towards a better future [00:01:00].

It's crucial to understand the foundation upon which Shane Dawson and YouTube itself were built, acknowledging that some of this foundation "isn't so good" [00:01:19]. Addressing these issues head-on is necessary for systemic change, preventing a cycle of merely reacting to new problems as they arise [00:01:31].

## Shane Dawson's Content

The host, a Black creator who grew up on the platform, had a "front-row seat" to Shane Dawson's rise [00:02:04]. Shane's videos were frequently featured on YouTube's front page for years [00:02:40]. However, the host personally found Shane's content, such as "ghetto girl makeup tips," unappealing [00:02:26].

Today, Shane Dawson is one of the most criticized figures on YouTube [00:03:08]. Much of this [[Criticism of sensationalist content on YouTube | criticism]] stems from his older content, primarily from around 2010 [00:03:30]. This past content includes blackface, other racist jokes, sexualizing minors, and jokes about abuse [00:03:43]. Some recent criticism also points to his role in the "image rehabilitation of white creators who have all in their own unique way said the n-word" [00:03:12].

### Warning for Shane's Content

Shane's past content contains blackface, other racist jokes, sexualizing minors, and jokes about abuse [00:03:43]. The speaker notes that these "worst of the receipts" are already well-documented in D'Angelo Wallace's thorough examination [00:04:02]. The video attempts to censor problematic content to avoid re-traumatizing anyone and to allow for monetization, with all proceeds being donated to RAINN, an organization that helps victims of abuse [00:03:59].

## Analysis of Shane's Apologies

### First Apology (2014)

Shane Dawson's first known apology occurred in 2014 when he was 26 years old [00:04:38]. This apology came approximately four to six years after he first received criticism for his use of blackface [00:04:44]. The speaker notes that other apologies before this time are unlikely, as Shane was still "snapping back" at critics on Twitter just three days prior [00:04:53].

In this apology, Shane claimed he had only learned what blackface was a month prior [00:05:12] and stated that his audience didn't take issue with it, asserting, "I never got comments about it it was fine" [00:05:37].

**Critique of First Apology:**
*   It is "incredible" that he claimed recent ignorance of blackface, given he had been criticized for it for years [00:05:27].
*   His defense that his audience didn't object is weak because:
    *   His audience was (and Shane was aware) "very young" [00:05:45].
    *   YouTube's algorithm creates an echo chamber, meaning those drawn to his content would likely not object [00:05:54].
    *   People *did* have a problem with it, and Shane was "widely criticized at the time" [00:06:09].
*   Shane himself stated in this apology that he ignored criticism for years [00:06:16], creating a contradictory narrative [00:06:22].
*   The apology appears to be a "save face" effort, aligning with an *LA Times* review of a movie he was promoting at the time [00:06:40]. Shane was concerned about his film receiving negative reviews due to his past behavior [00:06:53].
*   He "weirdly can't figure out how to not monetize his video," mentioning an ad for his movie [00:08:18]. This suggests the apology was largely "to protect his own bag" [00:08:37].
*   The video is described as "super defensive," with Shane complaining about being called "racist" after doing "something racist" [00:08:41].
*   Shane cherry-picked blackface as the issue, despite his movie being criticized for more [00:09:03], such as including a "black hobo eating his own [urine]" [00:09:12].
*   The video was "poorly planned out" and largely consisted of Shane making excuses for the circumstances of filming it [00:09:54].

**Defense of Content in First Apology:**
*   Shane's defense for using blackface was that he was "playing a character," specifically Wendy Williams or Raven Symone [00:10:43]. He stated he was "becoming the character" and "not making fun of them for being black" [00:11:00].

**Critique of Content Defense:**
*   It is obvious Shane was playing a character; the issue is that he used blackface [00:11:07].
*   He "sidesteps the fact that all the actual black people in his videos are just punchlines" or used to make his audience "okay with his use of the n-word" [00:11:19].
*   The most "insidious part of Shane's comedy is that he's consistently just putting down people of color" [00:11:32].
*   Building a brand on this type of humor (e.g., calling a Black woman who slaps her keyboard "black" and unable to make a video) is a "rotten foundation" [00:11:47].
*   The argument "it was a different time" is refuted by noting that Eminem faced protests for outlandish lyrics in the late 90s/early 2000s but "wouldn't cross" saying the n-word [00:12:01].
*   Shane defended his "comedic sensibilities" by stating he was "raised on Sarah Silverman" [00:12:21], but Silverman's blackface sketch was critical of blackface, unlike Shane's, and still drew backlash [00:12:35].

### Second Apology (2018)

Shane Dawson's second known apology came four years later, in 2018, when he was 30 [00:12:55]. This was the first time he addressed his history of sexualizing children [00:13:00].

**Focus of Second Apology:**
*   Instead of addressing the root of the problem, he focused on debunking a specific "doctored clip" that people were using to call him a pedophile [00:13:03].
*   Shane emphasized that the clip was "doctored to make him look bad and taken out of context" [00:13:50], while the full context still made him look bad [00:13:54].

**Critique of Second Apology:**
*   Shane committed a "logical fallacy known as a straw man," misrepresenting criticism to make it easier to defeat [00:14:56]. He focused on an argument (about his boyfriend and ex-girlfriend having "baby faces") that no one seriously made [00:15:32].
*   He should have apologized for sexualizing children, which is "far less defensible behavior" [00:16:01].
*   This sidestepping is a long-standing pattern for Shane, and he still had not addressed it [00:16:14].
*   Shane's past actions include:
    *   Kissing a 12-year-old girl on the lips [00:16:40].
    *   Swapping gum with another teen fan [00:16:42].
    *   Making inappropriate jokes to teenagers in live streams [00:16:48], such as joking about exposing himself to an audience he knew was young [00:17:01].
    *   These incidents demonstrate a "pattern" [00:17:13].
*   Such humor might be acceptable for an adult audience (like Eric Andre on Adult Swim), but it's problematic with a young audience and an exploited "power dynamic" in live streams [00:17:18].
*   Shane's own admission, "This is a bad idea anytime I do these tiny chats I always say something or show something," indicates he knew the behavior was inappropriate at the time [00:17:39].
*   The audience's normalization of this behavior is troubling, as seen in a chat comment "totally fine with you doing inappropriate stuff ha ha" [00:17:50].
*   The continued labeling of these actions as "bad jokes" diminishes their impact [00:19:13], as they represent a "pattern of behavior that could be harmful to his fans" and normalize a "standard of behavior" [00:19:19].
*   The apologies often feel like "damage control" focused on how the situation affects Shane rather than the victims [00:19:46].
*   There's a pattern of "performative contrition," using "over self-deprecating apologies" to emotionally manipulate the audience and gain sympathy [00:20:10].
*   Shane frequently claims to have "apologized many times" before [00:20:43], but only three apologies could be found, and his 2014 apology stated he ignored criticism, while the sexualization of minors was not addressed until 2018 [00:20:57].

### Third/Most Recent Apology

This apology, from around August 2020, was a response to a large Twitter thread about Shane's past [00:21:46]. It was also somewhat overshadowed by another thread and was quickly "undone" by the Tati Westbrook drama four days later [00:21:54].

**Analysis of Third Apology:**
*   It accomplishes more than previous apologies but still relies on familiar tropes of eliciting sympathy ("my childhood my past," "I hate that person so much," "I should lose everything") [00:22:12].
*   Critics argue that focusing on how bad he feels keeps the spotlight on him rather than the people hurt by his actions [00:23:19].
*   Shane acknowledges his racism, stating he "can't even imagine what it would be like to be black and to see this white guy do blackface and the whole internet at that time being like lol" [00:23:31]. The speaker praises this acknowledgement but wishes it wasn't "couched with like a call for sympathy" [00:23:47].
*   He admits that his actions "made young people at the time who were watching me think it was okay" [00:24:23], effectively acknowledging he normalized racism for his audience [00:24:18].
*   Regarding sexualization of minors, he rehashes his 2018 apology about the altered clip [00:34:07], which was "still bad in context" [00:34:22].
*   He describes a sexually inappropriate comment to his cousin as a "stupid weird family moment" that he shouldn't have shared online [00:35:27]. This minimizes the pattern of such behavior and ignores the numerous other clips of him making inappropriate comments to unrelated children [00:35:45].

## YouTube's Complicity

YouTube is deemed "everywhere" in this situation, having "outright supported" Shane Dawson from the beginning [00:37:45].
*   In the early days, Shane had numerous placements on YouTube's front page, likely manual placements before the algorithm dominated [00:37:52].
*   Only recently, in 2020, did YouTube take action by suspending ads on his channels for content that was "many many years old" [00:38:01]. This is seen as hypocritical because YouTube "knew that he posted this stuff" and was "complicit in creating his platform in the first place" [00:38:14].
*   [[Critique of conspiracy theories on YouTube | Hate speech]] has been against YouTube's community guidelines since day one, but it was "never really been enforced with Shane Dawson" [00:24:59]. YouTube's community guidelines also prohibit sexualizing minors, a rule that was in place before Shane created his problematic content [00:36:48].
*   YouTube's actions in similar situations have been "very slow" or non-existent, often only responding when there's a petition or someone gets arrested [00:39:36].
*   The platform needs Shane to help solve the "Shane Dawson problem," just as it "needed Shane back in the day as it looked the other way" [00:38:46].
*   Throwing Shane "under the bus now would just serve to spare YouTube PR and do nothing to solve the underlying issue" [00:39:00].
*   Shane's old content is seen as a symptom of a larger systemic problem on YouTube [00:39:05].
*   YouTube should be mindful of its algorithm and incentives, which can "drive people to do bad things" [00:39:47]. If YouTube doesn't intervene, the community will continue to see "the worst [content] imaginable" [00:39:59].
*   Community and industry leaders, including *USA Today* in 2010, also "propped up Shane back in the day despite the fact that his content was pretty objectionable" [00:40:21].

## Fan Defense and Harassment of Critics

Shane has a fanbase "pretty ready to defend him at every corner" [00:00:19]. His audience's "misunderstanding of the criticisms levied against Shane" is a core issue [00:00:50].

*   Fans defending Shane often use arguments such as:
    *   "He has many black friends and fans of different ethnicities" [00:29:37].
    *   "White people in the entertainment business are the most oppressed group in society" [00:30:02].
    *   "One small slip and they will be accused of racism homophobia sexism etc." [00:30:17] (despite Shane having "hundred videos in blackface") [00:30:32].
    *   "He made mistakes he's apologized and I don't believe that's who he is today" [00:31:57].
    *   "I wasn't perfect 10 years ago I bet you weren't either" [00:32:01].
*   This type of fan defense is "indicative still of the way that fans today defend Shane Dawson" [00:30:40].

**Harassment of Critics:**
*   Francesca Ramsey (chescaleigh) "tried to get through to" Shane for a long time [00:25:51]. Her criticisms were often met with Shane's audience "saying racist things to her" [00:26:01].
*   Shane interpreted criticism as "attacking" him [00:26:27], and his response to critics like Francesca was dismissive, asking her to "let the hate go girl" [00:27:34].
*   After his 2014 apology, Shane tweeted Francesca, mentioning her name despite her asking him not to [00:27:46]. This is seen as a disregard for the "inadvertent harassment that can happen" [00:28:00].
*   Francesca reported that a three-hour Skype call with Shane was mostly spent with him "crying and telling me how bad he felt" and "how he didn't want me to hate him" [00:28:21]. This indicates his primary concern was "how he's perceived and not like the harm that he's doing" [00:28:40].
*   An example of the harassment Francesca received was an email stating that "speaking out against racism" by "bashing people on their twitter" is "humiliating them" [00:29:27].
*   The speaker acknowledges being afraid to criticize Shane for fear of inviting "chaos" from his audience [00:42:46].

**Shane's Responsibility:**
*   Shane "shares some responsibility in how his audience is acting on his behalf" [00:30:47].
*   It is "on him to educate his audience that criticism against him is not an attack against him" [00:30:51]. While he has mentioned this, the message is not "seeping in" [00:30:58].
*   Shane "wields a lot of power" with his platform, and "with great power comes great responsibility" [00:31:09].
*   He needs to demonstrate a full understanding of all criticisms and his intentions moving forward [00:42:28].

## Conclusion

The speaker, as a creator, feels a responsibility to inform his audience of his stance, especially when it can help push dialogue forward [00:43:00]. It is crucial for all audiences to understand that "harassing people is not the move" [00:43:15]. Disagreement can lead to discussion, but there is a clear line before hate messages and threats of violence, which were occurring on Shane's behalf because he "didn't reign those people in at the time" [00:43:31]. This power must be handled mindfully [00:43:51]. The video concludes with a call to "repairing the foundation of our platform" [00:43:53].

*The Bachelor* is a popular reality television program described as a "marriage program" [00:00:53] where 30 random suitors are selected by [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | television producers]] to pursue marriage with an unemployed man [00:00:58]. The show has aired for 23 seasons [00:01:45].

## Premise and Format

The show's stated goal is for participants to find a partner to marry [00:00:53]. However, since no one typically marries someone they've known for the nine weeks it takes to film a season, the show's purpose often shifts to contestants gaining Instagram followers [00:01:10]. An article cited suggests that the Bachelorette in one season spent a maximum of 60 hours with the person she eventually became engaged to [00:01:13]. The speaker suggests that winning *The Bachelor* is "like losing" because success on the show can lead to starring in spin-offs [00:01:20].

### Spin-Offs
*   **The Bachelorette**: This show reverses the roles, featuring one woman choosing from multiple male suitors [00:01:27].
*   **Bachelor in Paradise**: A spin-off featuring former *Bachelor* and *Bachelorette* contestants who seek love again [00:01:31].

## Key Participants

### The Bachelor (Colton Underwood)
The specific season discussed stars Colton Underwood, described as looking like "Roy from *The Office* had a Chris Pratt glow up" [00:01:47]. His primary attributes highlighted on the show are:
*   **Ex-NFL player**: While technically true, he reportedly did not play in actual games [00:02:03].
*   **Virgin**: This aspect is heavily emphasized and frequently discussed throughout the season [00:02:07].

Colton is perceived as being "distilled into hot plus football plus virgin" on the show [00:03:01]. He also implies that his selection as *The Bachelor* was "unexpected," despite having been a contestant on a previous season of *The Bachelorette* [00:05:54].

### The Contestants
The contestants are often "distilled into one dimension" [00:03:05], leading to [[the_bachelor_contestant_stereotypes | stereotypes]] such as:
*   "Beauty queen" [00:03:10]
*   "Hot Latina from Miami" [00:03:10]
*   "Girl who faked an Australian accent" [00:03:12]
*   "Hot dog" (referring to a contestant who arrived in a hot dog costume) [00:05:12]
*   "Girl whose mom went to federal prison" [00:05:31]

Contestants employ various "cringy" tactics to be remembered, such as claiming to have not dated a virgin since age 12 [00:06:16], releasing live butterflies [00:06:26], bringing a bag of nuts to remember her "McNutt" last name [00:07:38], or even dressing as a sloth for the entire episode to symbolize taking things slow [00:07:06].

## Show Structure and Events

### Premiere and Live Show Element
The premiere of *The Bachelor* can be a three-hour event [00:03:38] that includes a live watch party featuring "excited bachelor fans" [00:03:46]. During this segment, people mostly discuss Colton's attractiveness [00:04:11] and various couples get engaged [00:04:16]. New girls are introduced based on their "one dimension," which can be uncomfortable [00:04:20].

### First Dates and Conversations
The initial one-on-one conversations between Colton and the contestants are often described as "boring" [00:09:42]. Colton struggles to remember all 30 names of the contestants he just met [00:10:05].

### Manufactured Drama
Because "nothing interesting actually happens in the show," the show [[producers_role_in_creating_drama_on_the_bachelor | manufactures drama]] and conflict through clever editing and by having contestants overreact to mundane situations [00:08:05].
*   **Identical Dresses**: A seemingly trivial incident where two contestants wear the same dress is dramatized [00:08:22].
*   **Interruption Rule**: Contestants are seemingly allowed to interrupt another's conversation with The Bachelor at any time, leading to conflict [00:12:04]. One contestant is positioned as a "villain" for repeatedly interrupting and talking to Colton four times, which is considered "unheard of" by other contestants [00:12:37].

### The First Impression Rose
This is a significant, loosely defined rule of the competition [00:11:13]. The Bachelor gives a rose to a girl he has a good initial impression of, though its long-term impact on the competition is minimal [00:11:16].

### The Rose Ceremony
This is a famous segment where The Bachelor gives roses to contestants he wants to keep, allowing them to remain in the "sex mansion" [00:13:33]. Contestants who are not given a rose are eliminated [00:13:47]. The departure of eliminated contestants is often accompanied by "exit interviews" [00:14:56].

## Behind the Scenes

The show is highly self-aware and leans into its "fake reality show" element [00:16:01].
*   **Producer Arrangement**: [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | Producers]] allegedly arrange conversations [00:16:06].
*   **Reshoots**: Scenes are sometimes reshot on separate days, with participants dressed in the same hair, makeup, and wardrobe to appear as if it's the same day [00:16:14].
*   **Creative Editing**: [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | Editors]] use reaction shots and apply them to different situations, or add overlay sounds to create drama and manipulate the storyline [00:16:22]. Viewers seem to accept this manipulation [00:16:38].

## Participant Motivation and Audience Engagement

Contestants often "metagame" the show, acting as villains to gain more screentime and grow their personal brand [00:16:42], with the ultimate goal of advertising products like "appetite suppressant lollipops" [00:17:09].

The show has a very active [[cultural_impact_and_fan_community_of_the_bachelor | fan community]] [00:16:51]. In cities like San Francisco, bars screen the show for communal viewing [00:16:54]. The fandom also engages in detailed analysis, such as interactive data visualizations of contestants' social media following growth rates [00:16:59].

## Overall Assessment

The speaker's personal experience watching *The Bachelor* led to the conclusion that it's "worse than I thought" [00:00:42]. He notes that no Bachelor seems to stay with the person who wins the show, with only one known exception who went on to star in "Worst Cooks in America: Celebrity Edition" [00:09:27].

Despite being a "total dumpster fire" [00:17:14], the show is considered interesting because people don't necessarily "enjoy the show itself" but rather "taking part in the spectacle of like the train wreck" [00:15:53]. This perspective contributes to a broader [[critique_of_the_bachelor_as_a_television_show | critique of The Bachelor as a television show]].

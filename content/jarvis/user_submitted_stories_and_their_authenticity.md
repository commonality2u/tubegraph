This article explores the nature of user-submitted stories, particularly those featured on "Not Always Right Comics," and questions their authenticity despite being presented as real experiences. While some platforms feature [[Critique of fake animated stories | fake stories created by content operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, "Not Always Right Comics" presents stories that are "probably submitted by real people" but are likely embellished or fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Not Always Right Comics

"Not Always Right Comics" on Instagram appears to be a blend of [[Comparisons between Actually Happened and Storybooth | animated story channels like 'Actually Happened']] and a web comic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It is an offshoot of the website "Not Always Right," which has existed since at least 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The website functions similarly to FML (Fuck My Life), allowing users to submit stories about people in their lives who are "not always right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. These stories primarily involve individuals working in service jobs dealing with rude customers, mean parents, or others who are in the wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Questioning Authenticity

Despite claiming to be real and user-submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, many of these stories raise doubts about their complete truthfulness.

### Self-Congratulatory Narratives
A significant characteristic of these stories is their self-congratulatory nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. They often position the submitter as the hero who "owns" or triumphs over an "entitled parent or customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This pattern suggests that stories may be embellished to allow the writer to "pat themselves on the back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Unbelievable Scenarios and Dialogue
The narratives often contain details or plot points that strain credulity:
*   **Implausible Ignorance:** One story features a character who doesn't know Hawaii is a U.S. state, despite traveling there domestically with knowledge of currency exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Such scenarios "undercut the point" the story attempts to make, like taking down bigotry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Strange Language:** The choice of words and phrasing in some stories can be confusing or sound unnatural, suggesting they might not be verbatim submissions or are heavily edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. For example, a character introducing themselves as "a teenage Chinese male but born and raised in Dundee, Scotland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Exaggerated Characters:** Stories frequently feature "unreasonable and stupid people that don't exist" in such extreme forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. These caricatures, often "Karens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, serve as foils for the protagonist's wisdom or patience.

### Wish Fulfillment and Recurring Tropes
Many comics cater to "wish fulfillment" for service workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. They provide an outlet to "stick it to the customer" when real-life situations prevent it due to fear of job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Recurring tropes include:
*   The problematic individual demanding to "speak to a manager," only to find the protagonist *is* the manager or the only one available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   The protagonist cleverly "owning" the rude person, often with a final, witty retort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Example Stories
*   **The Tattoo Hypocrite:** A school worker with an ivy tattoo is criticized by a "helicopter parent" for setting a bad example, only for the parent to reveal her own "tramp stamp" tattoo, making her a hypocrite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The story's resolution involves the protagonist gleefully pointing out the hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **The Racist Tourist:** A Hawaiian shop employee greets a customer with "Aloha," only for the customer to demand they speak English and express ignorance about Hawaii being part of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **The Velcro Wall Entitled Parent:** A parent insists their child must ride a velcro wall, even as the attraction is closing, exhibiting extreme entitlement and a lack of understanding of queues and rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. The story features a twist with the manager being a clown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **The Sexist Tech Support Caller:** A male customer demands to speak to a man in tech support, but the female representative is the only one who can help him, ultimately putting him in his place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **The Homophobic iPod User:** A customer expresses disgust upon hearing about a "male to male" RCA cable for an iPod, misinterpreting the technical term as a sexual reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   **The DVD Porn Flop:** A customer brings in a "broken" DVD player, which the technician discovers has a DVD inserted upside down. Upon flipping it, the store's sound system blares "a grotesque scene of a cheesy porn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, supposedly embarrassing the customer.

## Conclusion

While "Not Always Right Comics" aims to address disrespect faced by service workers and promote "woke" themes by featuring [[Storytelling and narrative styles in viral content | stories about overcoming racism, sexism, and homophobia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, the unbelievable nature and self-congratulatory tone of many stories suggest they are heavily fabricated or embellished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. The video concludes that while these comics are "goofy as hell" and not harmful, they fail to achieve their desired effect of being truly believable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. The central question remains: "what is everyone's fascination with stories being real?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a> Fictional stories are acceptable, as long as they are not presented as fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. This highlights a broader issue concerning [[Impact of fabricated stories on audience perceptions | the impact of fabricated stories on social media]] and [[Ethics of blending fiction and reality on social media | the ethics of blending fiction and reality]]. The analysis of such stories contributes to a wider [[Narrative analysis of fake stories | narrative analysis of fake stories]] and [[Authenticity of animated story channels | authenticity of online story channels]].

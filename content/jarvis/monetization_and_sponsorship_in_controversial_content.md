Content identified as "gold-digger pranks" on platforms like YouTube, which often involve scenarios designed to portray women as shallow or disloyal, generate significant viewership and financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. This type of content is described as among the "trashiest" on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

## Gold-Digger Pranks: A Case Study in Monetization

Channels like Woo Man TV, with approximately 5 million subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, specialize in "gold-digger pranks" and similar staged scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. These videos frequently accrue "tens of millions of views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

The core premise of these pranks often involves:
*   **Staged Interactions** Actors are frequently used, as evidenced by the use of lavalier microphones to capture crisp audio even when participants are far apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Stereotypical Portrayals** Women are often depicted as "shallow" and easily swayed by money or material possessions, such as expensive cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. The content is geared towards "mostly kids who want to confirm this preconceived notion that women are shallow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.
*   **"Exposure" Narrative** The videos typically conclude with the "gold digger" being exposed and shamed, while the prankster, such as Woo Man, is presented as the "moral victor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

## Revenue Streams

Creators of this controversial content employ several methods for monetization:

*   **Advertisements** Channels like Woo Man TV earn "a lot of money from ads" due to their high view counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.
*   **Sponsorships** These creators frequently partner with sponsors, often described as the "internet's sleaziest sponsors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. An example cited is a company offering "free hip and cool jewelry" where the customer only pays for shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. The question is raised as to "what sort of self-respecting brand would associate themselves with like such a horrible message" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.
*   **Merchandise** Creators like Woo Man TV also sell merchandise to their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.
*   **Educational Products** Woo Man TV, despite creating what is deemed [[criticism_of_sensationalist_content_on_youtube | sensationalist content]], offers a "masterclass on growing a YouTube audience," indicating direct monetization of his knowledge in audience growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

## Ethical Concerns and Impact

The content is viewed as "exploitative at best" if the creator is aware of its implications, or "ignorant" if not, especially considering the target audience often includes children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. The intent is seen as a "clear money grab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. This points to broader [[exploitation_of_preteens_for_monetization_on_youtube | exploitation of preteens for monetization on YouTube]] and [[ethical_concerns_about_content_appropriation_on_youtube | ethical concerns about content appropriation on YouTube]].

The pervasive nature of such pranks on YouTube, described as having been around "since the beginning," suggests a general acceptance among some audiences, even if it's not a "good reason" for their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This highlights the [[influence_of_sensational_content_on_viewer_engagement | influence of sensational content on viewer engagement]]. The underlying message, that "women are shallow," is deemed harmful, as it invents situations to "slut-shame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

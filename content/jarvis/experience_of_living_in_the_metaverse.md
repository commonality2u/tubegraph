The concept of the [[metaverse_technology_and_design_challenges | metaverse]] is an aspirational vision for an online version of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While the term itself has existed for a while with examples like Second Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> and VR Chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, much of the recent public discussion centers around Meta's version, known as Horizon Worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Despite Citibank valuing the metaverse at $13 trillion and Mark Zuckerberg investing $36 billion, Meta's platform has struggled with low user engagement and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. An investigation into living in this virtual space for a week reveals its current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Initial Setup and First Impressions

Upon re-activating a VR headset after nearly three years, significant software updates were required due to Facebook's rebranding to Meta and the associated changes to the Oculus brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This involved shedding an "old Oculus identity" to create a new "Meta identity," which mainly consisted of filling out forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The avatar chosen was a default option, "Friendly Jarvis," with a large square jaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

[[critique_of_facebooks_horizon_worlds | Meta Horizon Worlds]] is described as a "terrible name fitting for a terrible game," with common Google searches questioning its availability and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Despite being rated for teens, the default avatars do not resemble teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The loading screen presents an aspirational image that starkly contrasts with the game's actual appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Graphics and Movement

The graphics of Horizon Worlds are criticized as extremely poor, appearing to be a significant downgrade from expectations given Meta's $36 billion investment, likened to "Wii Sports" but without legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The deliberate decision to omit legs from avatars, despite walking being a fundamental video game mechanic since Pac-Man, results in users "sliding around with a floating torso," which is described as unnerving and causing light-headedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Natural movement options can also cause motion sickness, leading to the need for medication like Dramamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

The tutorial experience is minimal, feeling like an "abandoned carnival" filled with "janky mini-games and balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## The Search for Adults and the Children's Presence

A significant challenge was finding other adults in Horizon Worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Treating the metaverse experience like a 9-to-5 job meant most interactions were with children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Children Overrunning Spaces
*   **Comedy Club:** The Soapstone Comedy Club, chosen after the tutorial, was frequently overrun by pre-teens, engaging in slurs and offensive jokes despite rules against profanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Bowling World:** A bowling alley world, advertised with five people online, contained an actual infant and another child performing TikTok dances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **General Presence:** Even a "jail simulator" was found to be full of kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The metaverse only became open to teens in April 2023, suggesting children entered because adults became bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This highlights the issue of [[childrens_presence_in_adult_virtual_spaces | children's presence in adult virtual spaces]].

### Attempting to Find Adult Spaces
Searches for "18 plus" worlds revealed bars, clubs, and lounges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Gatsby's Bar:** This location attempted to implement an "anti-child technology" or "child lock" system, requiring users to stretch their arm span beyond 4.9 feet to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. While the system's effectiveness for short adults or tall teens is questioned, it provides a unique approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
    *   During the day, Gatsby's was mostly empty, featuring "basketball boys" who spent hours playing and topping leaderboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
    *   At night, Gatsby's became significantly more active, with 26 people, resembling a "Madison Square Garden" by Horizon World standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
    *   [[social_interactions_in_virtual_reality | Social interactions]] here were challenging, akin to feeling social anxiety in a high school setting where everyone already has friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Thrive Pavilion (Senior Center):** This world aimed to combat loneliness among older adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. While initially empty, a book club meeting later in the week had attendees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. The experience here was uncomfortable due to being a "sore thumb" as a new user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.
*   **Scenic Bar:** This popular 18+ world had a scenic view and activities like a zip line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. Attempts to join conversations revealed how easy it is to silently observe without belonging, and direct attempts to engage sometimes resulted in being told to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Black Magic Club:** A comedy club explicitly stated to not allow kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. It was mostly empty, but led to an unexpected connection with a silent user who assisted in a basketball game, showcasing a moment of support and acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

## Corporate Presence and User-Created Worlds

Meta has partnered with a limited number of brands, most notably Wendy's, which has an empty "Wendyverse" world that has been inactive since April 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Unofficially, users have created worlds mimicking brands like McDonald's and a "Disneyland VR parody," the latter being an impressive, albeit boring, one-to-one recreation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

### World Creators
An encounter with "Simi Bro," a prolific world creator and member of Meta's partner program, revealed that developing worlds is his full-time job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. This is surprising given Meta's reported low creator donations, suggesting Meta pays these developers separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. His worlds included a "VR bank" and a "VR Dollar Tree" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.

### Meta's Misleading User Statistics
Meta claims 200,000 monthly users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, but observed active users in the top 20 featured worlds totaled around 903 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This discrepancy, combined with the emptiness of most worlds, suggests Meta may be misleading with its user count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. The small user base leads to a "large high school" feel where the same faces are seen repeatedly, especially adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

## Conclusion

The experience of living in the metaverse, specifically Meta Horizon Worlds, is largely characterized by:
*   **Emptiness:** The vast majority of worlds are empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.
*   **Children's Dominance:** Many populated worlds are overrun by children, often engaging in disruptive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.
*   **Lack of Basic Features:** The absence of legs in avatars is a persistent and unsettling design choice, despite Zuckerberg's deceptive "grand reveal" of legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Social Anxiety:** The platform effectively emulates real-world social anxiety, making it difficult to join existing groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Limited Engagement:** Most interactive elements like bowling or basketball are difficult to use, and even core activities like meditation require constant manual input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The current version of the metaverse is seen as unlikely to succeed, with users often present "by brute force" or being children who are not supposed to be there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. While brief moments of genuine connection, like with "Silent Mike," or glimpses of user creativity, like the MetaCourt, exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>, the overall experience is described as "not fun" and a "strange strange place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.

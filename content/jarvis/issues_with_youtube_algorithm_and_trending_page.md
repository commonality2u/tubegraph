The YouTube platform, particularly its algorithm and trending page, faces criticism for promoting content that prioritizes quantity over quality and for featuring dishonest or entirely fabricated stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## Promotion of Dishonest Content
Channels operated by The Soul Publishing, such as [[123_go_trending_success_and_youtube_algorithms | 5-Minute Crafts]], Brightside, and "Actually Happened," are known to [[youtube_algorithm_and_channel_content_strategy | abuse the YouTube algorithm]] by favoring content volume over inherent quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. This includes Brightside's alleged plagiarism of other creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

A significant concern is YouTube's apparent "co-signing" of these channels, as "Actually Happened" videos have frequently appeared on the trending page, sometimes ranking as high as number three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This is problematic because the content from "Actually Happened" is often demonstrably fake or highly dishonest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## Fictional and Plagiarized Stories
"Actually Happened" claims to be a platform for real personal stories turned into animations, with the only criterion being their truthfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. However, this claim is false:
*   There is no genuine submission platform or website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Submissions are directed to a generic email ("welcome@brightside.me") used across all The Soul Publishing's channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   Stories are vague, generic, provably false, or stolen from the internet, often from Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.
*   Many stories are presented anonymously, allowing them to remain vague and avoid verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
*   The content frequently uses emotionally charged topics such as divorce, mental breakdowns, depression, and disease as clickbait, which is seen as emotionally manipulative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

For example, a video titled "My Mom Woke Up From A Coma And It's Terrifying" is likely fabricated, despite its emotional impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. The fact that the story is not real means viewers' emotional energy and condolences in the comments are expended on a fake scenario, solely to boost engagement metrics for the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>.

### Evidence of Fabrication
An email from The Soul Publishing, obtained by a Reddit user, reveals details about their "scriptwriter" job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>:
*   The company is likely based in Russia, with emails coming from a ".ru" domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.
*   Scriptwriters are responsible for the quality of stories told by "characters" on a YouTube channel nearing one million subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>. This channel is confirmed to be "Actually Happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>.
*   Scripts are required to be "believable," sounding like they are told by "real teenagers" and "as close to real life as possible without creating a sense that they're fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>.
*   Writers are encouraged to use "stories of real people that they shared on various social media platforms" as references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.
*   The scripts must be original stories with a clear beginning, development, and outcome to keep viewers engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>.
*   A strong emphasis is placed on "excellent quality of English," ensuring the "American viewer should feel that your central characters are native English speakers," despite primary communication needing to be in Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>.

## YouTube's Responsibility
The fact that these demonstrably fake stories appear on YouTube's trending page raises questions about the platform's responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>. It is noted that the trending page is not solely an automated system, suggesting human oversight or influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. Given YouTube's significant influence, it is argued that the platform should exercise greater rigor in promoting content, especially when users click on videos believing them to be real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. Intentionally blurring the lines between drama and real life has consequences, as exemplified by past incidents like "lonelygirl15" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>.

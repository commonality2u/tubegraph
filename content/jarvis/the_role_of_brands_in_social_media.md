Brands have become an inescapable presence across various social media platforms, extending their reach beyond traditional advertising methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Their antics, particularly on platforms like Twitter, have evolved, leading to a new dynamic in [[consumer_behavior_and_brand_interactions_on_social_media | consumer behavior and brand interactions on social media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Engagement and Attention Seeking

Brands actively seek attention and "clout" on social media, often engaging directly with content creators and users in hopes of gaining free advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This drive for visibility leads them to participate in online discussions, even when not directly addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This phenomenon highlights [[brands_seeking_clout_and_attention | brands seeking clout and attention]] as a core strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Examples of brands' attempts to engage and gain attention include:
*   Velveeta cheese operating a Twitter account with the handle "eat liquid gold official" and a bio describing "liquid gold Velveeta in all its delicious forms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   Uno's official account replying to unrelated posts and attempting to assert the "actual rules" of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Zaxby's being described as "super thirsty" for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Slim Jim's account direct messaging creators to compliment their content, in what can be perceived as a marketing scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## [[Brands as people marketing strategy | Brands as People Marketing Strategy]] and Relatability

A significant marketing push has aimed to transform brands into relatable entities with specific personality traits, mirroring human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This [[brands_using_social_media_for_relatable_content | brands using social media for relatable content]] strategy appears to have been successful, as the public now often expects brands to be "absurd and weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Examples of this approach include:
*   MoonPie's social media persona being perceived as "a stoner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   Sunny D's persona being portrayed as "sad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Wendy's creating Wattpad fan fiction stories, featuring characters dealing with job loss or love triangles, to evoke empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   Bagel Bites tweeting about unrelated topics rather than their product, aiming for a more "relatable" online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   Brands like Sunny D, Totino's, Bugles, Gushers, Chex Mix, and Kids Foot Locker playing online games like Among Us together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   McDonald's portraying itself as "depressed" on Twitter, with other brand accounts like Fall Guys replying in support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Stunts and Celebrity Collaborations

Beyond online personas, brands engage in "ridiculous stunts" to garner attention, often involving [[influential_social_media_figures_in_product_buying_trends | influential social media figures in product buying trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   McDonald's "casting a curse" on Travis Scott and turning him into a Happy Meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. They also transformed J Balvin into a literal "chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Xbox creating a real-life refrigerator version of its console and gifting it to Snoop Dogg and iJustine, leveraging the console's meme-like resemblance to a fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This became a talking point, achieving its goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   KFC developing a dating simulator game featuring Colonel Sanders on Steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   KFC also announcing the creation of a "KFConsole" designed to warm chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## The Human Element: [[Behind the scenes of social media management for brands | Social Media Management]]

Despite the often absurd content, these brand accounts are managed by human beings "just like trying to make ends meet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The content they create may be undervalued, as companies like GameStop reportedly encourage employees to create TikToks to gain virality, effectively seeking "free labor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This highlights a complex aspect of [[social_media_industry_and_job_roles | social media industry and job roles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## The Cycle of Engagement

The current dynamic creates a self-perpetuating cycle: brands engage in peculiar online behavior, which generates discussion and free advertising, leading them to continue these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The content produced by brands online is often perceived as "better than their product" itself, demonstrating the [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | impact of social media engagements by brands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This cyclical interaction means that even criticism or commentary on brand antics contributes to their visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The relationship can become personal, as seen when a creator forms a quasi-friendship with a social media manager for a brand like Stake'em, only to experience disappointment when perceived loyalty shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

Over several years, content creators have explored [[life_hacks_and_their_practicality | life hacks]], often revealing the [[humorous_consequences_of_following_life_hacks | humorous consequences of following life hacks]] alongside discussions of their practicality or lack thereof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Inspiration for these hacks often comes from platforms known for [[life_hacks_and_diy_culture | DIY culture]] and sometimes questionable advice, such as [[critique_of_5minute_crafts_life_hacks | 5Minute Crafts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, a desire for new, "awful" hack ideas led to soliciting suggestions from an audience on the Stereo app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The goal is to test the [[effectiveness_of_life_hacks_on_YouTube | effectiveness of life hacks on YouTube]], even if they verge on the [[bizarre_and_impractical_diy_trends | bizarre and impractical DIY trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Featured "Life Hacks" and Their Outcomes

### Googly Eye Cabinet Hack
This hack addresses the problem of someone not closing kitchen cabinets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

> "If you put large googly eyes on the inside of the cabinet doors, maybe the cabinet doors can make that meaningful eye contact for you and she'll never forget to close a cabinet ever again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The idea is that googly eyes staring back will "creep you out" and compel you to close the cabinets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
The visual result is indeed "a little creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Hot Pocket Koozie
This hack proposes a "beer koozie for hot pockets" to prevent burned hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. It claims the existing hot pocket sleeve is "useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

> "Introducing the fancy puffy jacket koozie for hot pockets specifically, it's for nothing else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

The visual of a hot pocket in a miniature puffy jacket koozie is described as looking like "you're eating a small person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Magic Eight Ball Decision Making
For the indecisive, this hack suggests using a Magic Eight Ball for "every single decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

> "No more thinking, just shake the ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

The presenter reveals that this has been his own "life hack" his entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Various eight balls, including Hello Kitty and Buzz Lightyear versions, are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Bernie Meme Filter/Replacer
This hack aimed to create a machine that automatically crops out all "Bernie with his jacket memes" from Instagram and Reddit feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. While actual removal was impossible, the presenter created a program to replace every image on the internet with a Bernie meme, humorously calling it "kind of like removing it but the opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### Ultimate Cup Holding Shirt
This hack suggests cutting a two-liter soda bottle in half and hot gluing it to a t-shirt to create a cup holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. An improvement on the hack involves using velcro so the cup holder can be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The creation involves cutting the plastic bottle (with a warning not to try this at home due to dangerous tools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a> and attaching it to a shirt with velcro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. The final product is a visibly awkward pouch on the stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Peanut M&M Peanut Extraction
This hack involves buying peanut M&Ms, putting them in a strainer, and running them under hot water until the coating and chocolate melt off, leaving "nice ready to eat peanuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The stated problem is the "too much work" involved in eating through the candy and chocolate layers to get to the peanut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The process is messy, with melted chocolate going everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, resulting in a single wet peanut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Two-Bowl Ice Cream Pint
This hack suggests cutting a cardboard pint of ice cream in half to create "two single use personal ice cream bowls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The presenter notes this is an "old as time" hack seen in countless [[life_hacks_and_diy_videos | life hack videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Cutting a frozen pint in half proves difficult, requiring a sharp knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. The result is two messy, half-open bowls of ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

### Coffee and Milk Shooter Hack
A hack for those who "always spill when you pour" or are "on the run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

> "Just bring a scorching hot coffee carafe with you and a jug of milk and just take it like shooters in the car no more mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

The idea is to simultaneously shoot coffee and milk into one's mouth while driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. The demonstration involves trying to drink hot coffee and milk directly from containers in a car, leading to spills and discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. The humor comes from the sheer impracticality and potential danger of the hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Shampoo Superglue/Tape Hack
To avoid forgetting shampoo, this hack suggests supergluing your hand to a bottle of shampoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. The presenter opts to tape it instead of using superglue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>, resulting in a hand rigidly attached to a shampoo bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. The hack immediately leads to shampoo in the eyes during a shower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. This highlights the [[safety_in_attempting_diy_life_hacks | safety in attempting DIY life hacks]].

### Shampoo Eye Protection Hack
Following the shampoo-in-eyes incident, this hack aims to prevent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

> "To avoid getting soap in your eyes while you shower, you get a headband hot glue two sponges to it and just wear it while you're in the shower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

The creator uses hot glue to attach sponges to a headband, with a warning not to try it at home, especially while wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. The resulting headpiece is awkward and ineffective, as water still gets into the eyes and mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. The experience is described as "genuinely awful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.

The video demonstrates that many suggested [[life_hacks_and_pranks_in_youtube_videos | life hacks]] lead to more [[humorous_consequences_of_following_life_hacks | humorous consequences]] and impracticality than genuine solutions, aligning with common themes found in [[life_hacks_and_diy_projects_in_fabiosa_videos | Fabiosa videos]] and similar content.

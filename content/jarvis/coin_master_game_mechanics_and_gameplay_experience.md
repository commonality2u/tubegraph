Coin Master is a mobile game that the creator became aware of through strange ads, particularly those featuring [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | Kris Jenner]] and [[celebrities_promoting_coin_master | Khloe Kardashian]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The game has been available since 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> and was created by Israeli game studio Moon Active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. It is a top-grossing mobile game in the UK and Germany and ranks in the top five in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Core Gameplay and Progression

The stated point of Coin Master is to build up a village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Players progress by building a house, then a better house, eventually accumulating a collection of villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. However, there is no customization, and all villages look exactly the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The game progression is entirely linear, with no real choices to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Players simply buy the next available item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

The central mechanic revolves around a slot machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. When players run out of in-game money, they go to the casino to spin the slot machine to earn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Village Raids

A significant aspect of gameplay involves attacking and raiding other players' villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   The best way to get more money in the game is to raid someone's village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   Spinning three hammers on the slot machine allows a player to raid another's village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   Landing on three pigs allows players to raid the "Coin Master's" treasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   Villages can be attacked and destroyed, costing money to repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### Spins and [[monetization_and_microtransactions_in_mobile_games | Microtransactions]]

Spins are central to the game's economy and player engagement:
*   Players receive five free spins per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   Once spins run out, there is literally nothing else to do in the game unless more spins are purchased with real money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   Players can also directly buy coins without spinning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, for example, 65 million coins for $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   Upon signing up with Facebook, players are gifted 50 free spins and a million free coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   A [[monetization_and_microtransactions_in_mobile_games | microtransaction]] offer appears every time a player runs out of spins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Gameplay Experience and Suspicions

The player experience in Coin Master is characterized by a feeling of constant winning initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, with extra spins and shields to protect villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. However, this quickly leads to a need for more spins or money.

### Lack of Authenticity and [[ethical_concerns_with_mobile_gaming_and_gambling | Ethical Concerns]]

The game is suspected of manipulating player experience:
*   The game is described as a "gambling app with a cartoonish art style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   The creator believes Coin Master could identify players likely to spend money and then make them get raided more often and win less from the slot machine, thus encouraging further spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   The game's claim of being multiplayer is questioned, as the accounts raiding a player's village are random people with generic first names and profile pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   Reverse image searches reveal that these avatars are all stock photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
*   There are many duplicate names among attackers, which is improbable for a worldwide game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   It's suspected that these "other players" could be fake accounts or an automated process designed to simulate multiplayer interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Not a "Game"

The creator argues that Coin Master lacks fundamental game elements:
*   There's no challenge, skill, or winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   Even if considered a game of luck, it lacks probabilities or decisions seen in games of chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   The game "beats you over the head with notifications and gifts to keep you on the hook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   New features, like a new spin wheel or a Tamagotchi-like pet, are suddenly introduced to keep players engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

> [00:19:00] It feels weird being encouraged to gamble.

The game is described as "scientifically engineered to cause a gambling addiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. This concern is heightened by the fact that one of Coin Master's top investors is the CEO of an online casino company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. While not inherently opposed to [[monetization_and_microtransactions_in_mobile_games | microtransactions]] for developers to earn money, the creator states that Coin Master is not truly a game; it has "game-shaped qualities" but "no substance," boiling down to its "most money-making qualities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. The "soulless" nature of the game is the biggest problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

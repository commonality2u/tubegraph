This article explores various [[Life hacks and DIY culture | life hacks]] that involve [[bizarre_and_impractical_diy_trends | repurposing]] common household items for highly unusual or unintended purposes. These ideas were submitted by an online audience in response to a request for "worst life hack ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Cabinet Googly Eyes

One proposed [[Life hacks and DIY culture | life hack]] addresses the problem of people leaving kitchen cabinets open. The solution involves attaching large googly eyes to the inside of cabinet doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The idea is that the "meaningful eye contact" from the googly eyes will "creep out" the individual, prompting them to close the cabinet and never forget again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Hot Pocket Koozie

A [[Life hacks and DIY culture | life hack]] suggests using a beer koozie specifically for holding hot pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This is proposed as a way to avoid getting burned and to offer a more "stylish" and "comfortable" hold, as the hot pocket's original cooking sleeve is deemed "useless" and not insulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The suggested item for this [[Life hacks and DIY culture | hack]] is referred to as a "fancy puffy jacket koozie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Magic Eight Ball Decision-Making

For individuals who are very indecisive, a [[Life hacks and DIY culture | life hack]] recommends using a Magic Eight Ball to make every single daily decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This eliminates the need for personal "thinking" and allows one to "shake the ball" for answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Examples of such items used include a Hello Kitty Eight Ball and a Buzz Lightyear Eight Ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, as well as a "Mr. Predic-to" device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Internet Bernie Meme Filter

An unconventional [[Life hacks and DIY culture | hack]] suggests creating a machine that automatically crops out all "Bernie with his jacket memes" from Instagram and Reddit feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Although the original intent was removal, the demonstration of this [[Life hacks and DIY culture | hack]] involved replacing every image on the internet with a Bernie meme instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Ultimate Cup Holding Shirt

To address the problem of not having a convenient place to put a drink, a [[Life hacks and DIY culture | life hack]] proposes creating an "ultimate cup holding shirt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This involves cutting a two-liter soda bottle in half and hot-gluing it to a t-shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. An improvement on the initial [[Life hacks and DIY culture | hack]] suggests using a velcro strip to make the cup holder removable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Peanut M&M to Peanut Conversion

For those who "don't have all day" to eat through a candy and chocolate layer to get to a peanut, a [[Life hacks and DIY culture | life hack]] suggests turning peanut M&M's into plain peanuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This is achieved by putting the M&M's in a strainer and running them under hot water until the coating and chocolate melt off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, leaving "ready to eat peanuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## Ice Cream Pint as Two Bowls

A commonly seen [[Life hacks and DIY culture | life hack]] involves cutting a cardboard pint of ice cream in half to create two "single use personal ice cream bowls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This [[Life hacks and DIY culture | hack]] assumes that one is always sharing half a pint with friends and does not want to store the ice cream again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

## On-the-Go Coffee and Milk Shots

To prevent spills when pouring coffee, a [[Life hacks and DIY culture | life hack]] for "working girls on the run" suggests carrying a scorching hot coffee carafe and a jug of milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Instead of pouring, one should "take it like shooters in the car," drinking both liquids simultaneously to avoid mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This effectively creates a latte inside one's stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

## Never Forget Shampoo Hack

For those who consistently forget shampoo when entering the shower, a [[Life hacks and DIY culture | life hack]] suggests super-gluing one's hand to a bottle of shampoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. This ensures one "always have shampoo on you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. As a safer alternative, the demonstrator opted to tape the shampoo bottle to their hand instead of super glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

## Anti-Shampoo-in-Eyes Headband

Following the "never forget shampoo" hack, another [[Life hacks and DIY culture | hack]] addresses getting soap in the eyes during a shower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. The proposed solution is to get a headband, hot-glue two sponges to it, and wear it while showering to divert water away from the eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

These [[Life hacks and DIY culture | life hacks]] demonstrate [[bizarre_and_impractical_diy_trends | creative, yet often impractical, repurposing]] of everyday objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, highlighting the diverse and sometimes absurd nature of [[Life hacks and DIY culture | DIY culture]].

The internet is often described as a "strange place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, particularly concerning how [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brands]] engage on social media. Historically, [[corporate_humor_and_communication_on_social_media_platforms | brand Twitter]], where companies like Wendy's and Burger King tweet as if they are individuals, has created a "strange dystopia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. While once a unique phenomenon, this type of engagement eventually became "samey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, leading to a need for new and interesting developments to merit discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The Target vs. Walmart "War"

A new trend emerged on TikTok and Twitter, predominantly TikTok, resembling a "war" between Target and Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This conflict, involving two multi-billion dollar department store corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, originated over shopping carts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> and quickly escalated to include threats, bullying, theft, and [[corporate_humor_and_communication_on_social_media_platforms | corporate espionage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. A consistent element in "every good [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing scheme]]" from such corporations is the "exploitation of its undervalued employees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Employee-Driven Viral Trends

Unlike centrally planned [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing campaigns]], this "marketable internet moment" began with a single Target employee, Jaden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This employee discovered a Walmart shopping cart and created a fictional "hostage" scenario, demanding a response within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The video quickly went viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, showcasing the essence of TikTok, where bored employees find creative ways to engage with their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Jaden continued the narrative with follow-up videos, despite being a young employee just "working at Target" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Brand Capitalization on Employee-Generated Content

Recognizing the virality, Walmart's [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing team]] seized the opportunity to respond, aiming to increase [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | brand engagement]] and please corporate executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Their response, involving a "Target ball" wearing a Walmart jacket, was described as "hilarious" and "solid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

This corporate response led to an "arms race," as Target then officially responded, invoking a "war general ball" to "assemble the avengers of Target's corporate partners" like Starbucks, Ulta, Disney, and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The corporate video, though "unsettling" due to its animation style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, garnered comments from other [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brands]], such as Pizza Hut Express, attempting to join the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

A peculiar aspect of this [[consumer_behavior_and_brand_interactions_on_social_media | brand interaction]] was that some TikTok users treated the official Target account like a "small up-and-coming TikTok creator," mistakenly leaving comments like "here before you get one no followers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Independent Employee Participation and Escalation

Other employees, like Colton (user "colton runs 2003"), also became central figures, with Colton leading a "Walmart army" of shopping carts and acting like a "war general" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. These independent employee videos were often deemed "funnier" than the official brand content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

The "war" continued with various fictional events:
*   Walmart employees, like "burnt bacon 5631," "rescued" Walmart carts from Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, indicating a "nationwide epidemic" of cart "hostage" situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   Jaden responded with a cinematic video implying the "rescued" Walmart cart was a "double agent" or "Trojan horse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   Colton launched a "sneak attack," personally stealing a Target cart and asking viewers to choose a side: "Are you red or are you blue?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This act, while "illegal," was accepted due to its contribution to the [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | brand marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   The conflict even pulled in "otherwise neutral nations" like Home Depot, who took Walmart's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, and saw Amazon attempting to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   The "devious licks" trend, involving theft, also crossed over into the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

### The Role of Independent Creators

Creators like "dm vibes" produced highly cinematic and well-done TikToks, demonstrating their skills within this absurd trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This highlights how such trends can provide "burgeoning small creators" an opportunity to showcase their talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

## Implications for Brands and Employees

It is believed that this "war" was not a pre-planned [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | grand marketing scheme]] but rather started by a few random employees, with companies capitalizing on already viral TikToks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. Fortunately, the employees involved were not fired, which has happened in other instances where workplace videos went viral, providing free advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. While brands "pay big money" for this level of attention, it is unclear if the employees received compensation for their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, though they did gain "TikTok clout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a> and potential opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

The "cold war era" of this conflict saw tensions cool, with Colton still attempting to provoke Target, who seemed to have made peace with the stalemate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. However, the feud later reignited on Twitter, with official [[brands_using_social_media_for_relatable_content | brand accounts]] engaging in personal banter, such as Target tweeting "because we're not Walmart" and Walmart responding with a Mariah Carey meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

Ultimately, while these events are "mostly harmless" and foster creativity, it is important to remember that corporations are "profiting off of our attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. The phenomenon of employee-driven viral trends highlights the evolving landscape of [[social_media_industry_and_job_roles | social media management]] and [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | brand engagement]], often blurring the lines between genuine employee expression and corporate [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing strategies]].

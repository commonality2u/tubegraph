Recent times are described as a "podcasting Renaissance for dudes with terrible opinions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This era is characterized by shows that promote misogynistic viewpoints and engage in controversial discussions.

## Fresh and Fit

The Fresh and Fit podcast is identified as a prime example of this trend, being described as a podcast primarily "about calling women dumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It's credited with having "revolutionized the misogyny podcast format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Instead of just two men discussing topics, they bring on multiple women (often up to ten) to talk over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Key criticisms of Fresh and Fit include:
*   **Questioning Guests** When not yelling, hosts ask "leading questions about promiscuity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, such as inquiries about "body count" or whether women would "give up Instagram for a man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. They also question if women's dating standards are "realistic or delusional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Kicking off Guests** Women who disagree with the hosts or if the host is in a bad mood are often "kicked off the show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. A "Supercut of Myron getting emotional and kicking women off the show" exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Demographics** The podcast is noted for being "shot at night" and often featuring "women of color to embarrass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, hosted by "two black guys named Myron and fresh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Host Charisma** Despite their problematic content, the hosts are acknowledged as being "charismatic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

## Whatever Podcast

The Whatever Podcast is presented as a contrasting yet similar example, described as "the exact opposite" of Fresh and Fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. It's "shot in the day," features "far fewer guests of color," and is hosted by a white guy named Brian (stylizing his name as Brixton) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This podcast is accused of "gentrifying misogyny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Format and Content
*   **Host Demeanor** Unlike Fresh and Fit, Brian tends to "grumble meekly" and look off-screen for reassurance rather than yelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Co-host Kiki** Brian's co-host is a sex doll named Kiki, who is introduced in every episode as being "a bit shy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This is seen as a "transparent objectification of women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Guest Panels** The show features "a panel of entirely too many guests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Repetitive Questions** The show asks "incredibly original and hard-hitting questions" identical to Fresh and Fit, such as "what is your body count?" and "would you give up Instagram for a man?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. A recurrent question is "why are women's standards so high?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Traditional vs. Modern** Despite focusing on modern dating, the show frequently discusses "Traditional Values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Male Grievances** Brian often brings up topics like military conscription and male casualties in warfare, arguing that "the suffering men have experienced when it comes to Warfare outweighs all of women's Collective grievances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Women guests' reactions to these monologues are often "blank stares" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Controlling Scenarios** Hypothetical questions are posed to women, such as whether they would give up all personal freedoms for a man who doesn't cheat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, framing a woman's refusal as "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Insecurity and Control** The host's worldview is seen as rooted in "insecurity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, suggesting that if a girlfriend receives attention from other men, the response is to "control her access to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This approach is criticized as "bananas" and unhealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, advocating for "trust your partner" instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The hosts expect women to ask "if she's allowed to go outside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Personal Experiences** Brian recounts "saddest stories" about going to bars where no one talks to him, contrasting it with women who get hit on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. He shares negative experiences with dating apps like Bumble, where women's first messages were often just "hey," despite his "interesting as sh*t profile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Panel Composition** The show often features "only fans models in literal college students" who expect a fun dating show but are instead forced to "debate Chase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, a "super conservative God guy on Twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. The show frequently devolves into debates between "Brian's conservative guests debating with sex workers and college girls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Problematic Guests** The podcast has hosted individuals who "defended domestic abuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Guest Recruitment** An expired casting call described the show as being about "modern dating and relationships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. While guests can bring a girlfriend, carpooling results in everyone being kicked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Many guests are Instagram models or OnlyFans creators who use the platform for "conversion for their platform" despite being "shamed on the show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Some women actively go on the show to "debunk the show" and farm viral TikTok clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Lack of Belief** Brian is seen as the "most reluctant misogyny profiteer" who may not "even be convinced that he believes what he's saying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. He "doesn't like these terms like Alpha and high value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
*   **Unentertaining** Unlike Fresh and Fit, Brian is described as "just flat" and "not even entertaining when he kicks people off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. He is compared to "Toby from the office hated women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
*   **"Hat Trick"** Brian takes "pride" in kicking off guests, even calling it a "hat trick" when he technically kicks off three due to carpooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Cash Grab** The show is seen as a "cash grab" for Brian, who previously made prank videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

### Live Chat Behavior
A significant aspect of the Whatever podcast's criticism is its live chat, which allows "women hating in real time and donate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.
*   **Gendered Language** If a man speaks, the chat responds with "w man Big W Chad." If a woman speaks, they respond with "dumb lady bad lady" and "spam 304" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   **"304" Code** The code "304" is used to spell "hoe" when turned upside down on a calculator, described as "the most Middle School sh*t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. This is called a "universal code for incels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
*   **Host's Reaction** Brian is described as a "Meek little worm" who won't "body shame his guests himself" but will "laugh at it" or "offer his full-throated support" if someone in the chat does so for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Monetized Harassment** Viewers spend "hundreds of dollars" to "virtually cat call and Heckle women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>, or to have "ongoing conversation with the panel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. One viewer spent $500, YouTube's daily maximum, asking the girls to rate him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. This community fosters "lost men" who hate women but secretly seek their approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

### Overall Assessment
The podcast is described as "so boring" and "no one seems to be having a good time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Even the host's own audience has started to turn on him for "not being masculine enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. This situation is viewed as sad, appearing as a "guy half-heartedly going for a cash grab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

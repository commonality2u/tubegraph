From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The hosts discuss the definition of "turnt" and the [[tiktok_community_dynamics_and_meme_culture | social media phenomenon]] of being "Two Turnt Tony," exploring the boundaries of acceptable and excessive "turntness." The aim is to use Tony as a "cautionary tale" to understand what to avoid when trying to be "turnt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:41">[01:33:41]</a>.

## Defining "Turnt" and "Two Turnt"

Initially, the host expresses a desire to be "turnt" as bars are reopening and vaccinations are becoming widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. However, there's a concern about getting "too turnt," likened to getting "too ripped" at the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. The goal is to understand the "boundary" between being "fun-loving" and becoming "two turnt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Two Turnt Tony: A Case Study

The discussion centers around a TikTok creator known as "Two Turnt Tony" (Twitter handle: @tooturnthoney_ ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, who is seen as the embodiment of "two turnt" behavior.

### Characteristics of Two Turnt Tony

Tony's online persona and actions display several "two turnt" characteristics:
*   **Aggressive Online Engagement** He replies aggressively to even innocuous tweets mentioning him, such as one that states he uses a duck as a prop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. His replies are characterized by strong language and unusual punctuation, like ellipses, making aggressive statements sound calmly delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:43">[03:23:43]</a>.
*   **Self-Identification** His Twitter bio states he's "living for a living" with a devil emoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. The hosts interpret "living for a living" as being "up to no good" and not "working to live," suggesting Tony's actions are "a little bit too turnt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:10">[05:00:10]</a>.
*   **Self-Monitoring** Tony actively searches his own name online to find mentions, even replying to tweets he cannot fully see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. This suggests he doesn't "take any sort of lip from anyone on the internet," even in neutral contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Eccentric Habits and Content**
    *   **Ducks and Chickens as "Pets" vs. "Props"**: Tony identifies as the "duck guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>, asserting his birds are "pets" rather than props <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. However, the hosts debate this, noting his "sensual" holding of a chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a> and dressing a duck in lingerie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>, which appears to be using them as props for comedic or controversial effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. This raises questions about [[the_concept_of_exploitation_and_reality_tv | exploitation]] and whether the animals are compensated for their "non-union gig" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Unusual Consumption Methods**: Tony claims to be addicted to "eggplant emoji pills" (suggesting erectile dysfunction medication) and consumes them inappropriately from a comically large bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. He also states he can only drink through a beer bong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>, leading the hosts to wonder if this applies to all liquids, like milkshakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Animal "Relationships"**: His TikToks depict a dramatic storyline where his duck is jealous of a chicken he is seen interacting with, implying complex "relationships" and infidelity within his animal cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. One video even features a duck "speaking" with a "yes daddy" line, raising concerns about a "daddy kink" and [[the_concept_of_exploitation_and_reality_tv | exploitation]] of a pet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Public Antics and Lack of Clothing**: Tony often appears shirtless, even in public settings like grocery stores, where he was filmed being confronted by a manager for being "naked" in an aisle while shopping with his duck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[00:26:40]</a>.
    *   **Controversial "Challenges"**: He engages in "prank challenges," such as a golf putt where he offers to spit in someone's mouth if he makes the shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>.
    *   **Family Involvement**: Tony's content often features his family, including his parents and sister, who are sometimes the subjects of his pranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>. His mother is portrayed as being very vulgar and disapproving of the "masked girls" Tony brings around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>. These interactions often appear staged, creating a [[the_concept_of_exploitation_and_reality_tv | reality show vibe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:00">[28:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Dangerous Pranks**: One prank involved leaving his sister passed out on a boat at sea with a chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. This act is seen as "definitely endangering the animal" and potentially the sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a>.

### "Acceptable" Turntness

The hosts ultimately advise against getting "as turnt as Tony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:00]</a>. Instead, "appropriate turntness" involves having a few drinks and dancing at a club or bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:00">[31:39:00]</a>, and making out with humans, not ducks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:00">[31:54:00]</a>. Wearing a ski mask during human interactions is deemed acceptable if consensual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:00">[32:06:00]</a>. Tony's "pre-worn crop tops" sold on Depop are also deemed "appropriate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:28:00">[32:28:00]</a>.

Despite significant financial investment, Meta's vision for the metaverse, specifically through its platform Meta Horizon Worlds, faces numerous technological and design challenges that hinder its widespread adoption and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The term "metaverse" itself is aspirational, referring to an online version of reality, with precursors like Second Life and more recently, VR Chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Discrepancy Between Investment and Reality

While Citibank once valued the metaverse at $13 trillion, Facebook's metaverse platform had only 38 users and generated a mere $470 in revenue at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Although the actual user count is higher than 38, it does not justify the $36 billion Mark Zuckerberg has invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Meta claims 200,000 monthly users for Horizon Worlds, but the actual concurrent users in top worlds suggest a much lower number, possibly around 903 users at a given time, indicating potentially misleading statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## Core Design and User Experience Issues

Meta Horizon Worlds is criticized for its fundamental design flaws and poor user experience, leading to its unpopularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Technical Shortcomings
*   **Graphics Quality**: Despite massive investment, the graphics are described as extremely poor, akin to "Wii Sports" but lacking basic features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Lack of Legs**: A significant design decision was the absence of avatar legs, leading to users floating around as "disembodied torsos," which is unnerving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This became a point of controversy when Mark Zuckerberg showcased "legs" in 2022 that were later revealed not to be real-time tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Movement Sickness**: The default movement settings are stiff and can cause motion sickness for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Basic Interaction Failures**: Users report difficulties with fundamental VR interactions, such as picking up objects like bowling balls or shooting a basketball accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### Onboarding and Customization
*   **Tedious Setup**: Users face extensive software updates and account re-branding (from Oculus to Meta identity) even after years of owning the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Limited Identity Customization**: Users are often stuck with default avatars and have limited ability to change their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Lack of Home Personalization**: Users are given identical, pre-furnished homes without the option to customize them, leading to a feeling of disconnect from their virtual space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## [[Social interactions in virtual reality]] Challenges and Content Moderation

[[Social interactions in virtual reality]] within Horizon Worlds are fraught with issues, leading to a challenging [[experience_of_living_in_the_metaverse]].
*   **Empty Worlds**: The majority of worlds are empty, making it difficult to find people to interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Difficulty Finding Adults**: Many public spaces are overrun by [[childrens_presence_in_adult_virtual_spaces | children]], often engaging in offensive language and behavior, making it hard for adults to find age-appropriate interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Ineffective Age Gating**: Despite being rated for teens, the platform's "18+ worlds" often have no robust mechanisms to prevent [[childrens_presence_in_adult_virtual_spaces | children]] from entering, relying on social ridicule or simple arm-span measurements as "child locks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Social Anxiety**: The platform's mechanics can exacerbate social anxiety, making it difficult to join existing conversations, much like in real-life social settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Poor Moderation**: Despite rules against vulgarity, profanity, and derogatory jokes, spaces like comedy clubs are rife with such content, largely due to the presence of unmoderated [[childrens_presence_in_adult_virtual_spaces | children]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Even adults complain about "cancel culture" limiting their humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **Chaos in User-Created Experiences**: User-organized events, like a virtual court, can devolve into chaos due to participants disrupting proceedings, creating portals, and a reliance on user-driven voting to kick people out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

## Business and Content Strategy Failures

### Brand Integration
*   **Limited Official Partnerships**: Unlike platforms like Fortnite that officially partner with major IPs, Meta Horizon Worlds has very few official brand integrations, with Wendy's being a notable, and often empty, example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
*   **User-Created Parody Worlds**: The lack of official IP leads users to create "parody" versions of popular brands, like "Disneyland VR parody," as a legal workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

### Creator Economy
*   **Unsustainable Creator Model**: Despite Meta's partner program for world developers who work full-time, the reported creator donations are extremely low, suggesting Meta is largely subsidizing these creators "on the side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[critique_of_facebooks_horizon_worlds | critique of Facebook's Horizon Worlds]] highlights significant technological and design flaws. From poor graphics and missing basic features like legs, to severe social interaction issues due to low adult user count and [[childrens_presence_in_adult_virtual_spaces | children]] running rampant, the platform fails to deliver on the metaverse's ambitious promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>. The experience suggests that, despite billions invested, this version of the metaverse is far from taking off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

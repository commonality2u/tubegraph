The presence of brands on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, has evolved significantly, leading to various forms of [[corporate_humor_and_communication_on_social_media_platforms | corporate humor and communication]] and subsequent criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Brands, not limited to just food, are increasingly attempting to be "relatable" online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Evolution of Brand Presence

Early brand activity on Twitter involved simple personification, with accounts discussing mundane activities like having a sandwich or being tired from work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This largely stemmed from Twitter's original design, which encouraged users to share what they were doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

The trend of brands being relatable or using memes is often traced back to Denny's on Tumblr around 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. However, brands have been personifying themselves on social media since its inception, with [[strategies_of_fastfood_brands_on_twitter | Wendy's]], for example, posting relatable tweets about chocolate milk nine years prior to the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Current Tactics and Public Reaction

Modern corporate Twitter accounts engage in a variety of behaviors to appear relatable:
*   **Out-of-Touch and Trending Content** – Brands face a dilemma where critics label their out-of-touch content as "stupid brand" and their trending content as equally "stupid brand" or "how do you do fellow kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Ironic and Self-Aware Content** – When brands attempt self-aware or ironic posts, critics argue they are "destroying the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Viral Engagements** – [[wendys_viral_twitter_interactions_and_roasting_culture | Wendy's]] is known for its "roasting" culture and even released a "cringey" mixtape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Emotional & Relatable Posts** – Sunny D's tweet "I can't do this anymore" during the Super Bowl was widely misinterpreted as a cry for help, leading to other brands like Pop-Tarts and MoonPie responding with support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This led to brands like Little Debbie and DiGiorno Frozen Pizza tweeting about mental health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Brand "Beef" and Diss Tracks** – Chester Cheetah, the mascot for Cheetos, released a diss track about Doritos, which was criticized as pointless since both brands are owned by the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Absurd and Questionable Tweets** – An unconfirmed tweet from Orville Redenbacher discussing toilet hygiene was presented as an example of how believable absurd brand content has become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Personified Non-Mascot Accounts** – Even the official Twitter account itself tweets "like a person," engaging in conversations and promoting videos with celebrities like Chrissy Teigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Thirst Tweets** – Elon Musk, seen as a brand himself, engaged in "thirst tweeting" with a Twitter account for the planet Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Burger King also posted a "tender ad" for Valentine's Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## The People Behind the Accounts

Many assume that corporate Twitter accounts are managed by marketing executives in boardrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. However, these accounts are often run by "regular people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   Nathan, a "dude with a podcast," runs the Steak-umm Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   Amber Gordon, who was 23 during Denny's social media rise to fame, managed their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

Managing social media accounts can be a challenging job with harassment directed at the individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Social media managers often have little freedom and are "goofing around while trying to pay their rent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This highlights [[employeedriven_social_media_trends_and_brand_capitalisation | employee-driven social media trends and brand capitalisation]], where personal expression is harnessed for corporate gain.

## Broader Perspective on Criticism

While brands "increase sales with shitposts" and their "weird advertising practices" should continue to be called out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, it's important to direct criticism at the brand account itself and avoid harassing the individuals behind the accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

Concerns about corporate Twitter accounts are considered less significant than issues like the spread of misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, [[criticism_of_lowquality_content_on_youtube_channels | low-quality content on YouTube channels]], [[criticism_of_content_farms | content farms]], and [[social_media_outrage_culture_and_its_monetization | social media outrage culture and its monetization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Brands are seen to fill an existing need between consumers and brands, especially in America where there's a culture of celebrating brands and their commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Consumers are, in a sense, inviting these brands to entertain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

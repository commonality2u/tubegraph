Mobile game advertisements often employ specific targeting strategies to reach their intended audience, sometimes resulting in absurd, manipulative, or privacy-invasive campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## How Mobile Game Ads Target Users

Advertisers use personal data to tailor the ads shown to users. For example, an ad might be displayed because the user is identified as an "18 to 35 year old single male in California who watches Game of Thrones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This level of [[ad_targeting_and_tracking_on_the_internet | ad targeting]] can feel intrusive, with ads seemingly "figuring out" personal details about the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Types of Mobile Game Ads

Mobile game ads often feature outlandish scenarios and questionable content to capture attention.

### [[misleading_mobile_game_ads | Misleading]] Word Games
Some ads promote word games that are set in unusual scenarios, like prison, where players can supposedly "break out of prison with words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. These ads often depict bizarre escape attempts, such as a loved one trying to smuggle out a prisoner in a sack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, or a suitcase falling from the sky after spelling a simple word like "Bone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. The art style of these ads can also be suspiciously similar to existing webcomics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

### [[interactive_story_mobile_game_ads | Interactive Story Games]]
Games like Choices, Episode, and Chapter are prominent in the [[interactive_story_mobile_game_ads | interactive story game]] genre, known for their often absurd and dramatic advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. These games allow players to make "important choices" within submitted stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

Common themes in these ads include:
*   **Sex and Cheating**: Many stories revolve "exclusively about sex and cheating and pregnancy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, featuring scenarios like being caught with a stranger while a girlfriend is arriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> or "thirst texting" an ex while in bed with another person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **High Drama**: The ads often showcase incredibly dramatic situations, such as a character trying to drown another person in a pool and then having options to "Oops!" or "Save him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>, or even considering kissing someone who might be dying instead of performing CPR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   **Love Triangles and Pregnancy**: A recurring narrative involves a man with a pregnant wife and a pregnant girlfriend who are unaware of each other until a public confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. The ads often portray these scenarios with intense, soap-opera-like exposition and camerawork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

### Ads Designed to Evoke Negative Feelings
Some mobile game ads are designed to make the viewer "feel bad about myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. These include:
*   **"Real men, don't get wet?"** featuring a seemingly nonsensical phrase applied to unrelated visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.
*   **"I never knew anxiety until I played this"**: These ads suggest the game will cause anxiety, which is presented as a reason to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. This often involves captions taken from other sources or applied randomly to different games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
*   **"How many neurons can you break?"**: Implying brain damage as a result of playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.
*   **"This game will ruin your life."**: Directly stating the game will have negative consequences, such as framing you for murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

## Voodoo's Ad Strategies

Many of these bizarre ads are linked to [[ad_trends_and_strategies_by_voodoo | Voodoo]], a French app developer and one of the largest game publishers on iOS and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. Voodoo is known for developing their own games and creating these unusual text captions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.

Key aspects of Voodoo's advertising approach:
*   **Reputation**: Voodoo is often accused of copying other people's games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a> and received a $200 million investment from Goldman Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.
*   **Nonsensical Captions**: Their ads frequently feature confusing phrases like "From two to 31 inches caliber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>, "Only left-brain people can reach the pink color" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>, or "If you reach Japan, you're legally skilled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. These phrases are seemingly arbitrary and have no logical connection to the gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
*   **Shotgun Approach**: Voodoo appears to experiment by applying "random pieces of text... on random gameplay videos and seeing what works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.
*   **Massive Scale**: Through tools like the Facebook Ad Library, it's evident that Voodoo runs an enormous number of ad campaigns, with over 8,000 active campaigns in the US alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. This scale suggests hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on ads monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>.
*   **Controversial Ads**: Some of their discontinued ads include highly questionable content, such as a game about "nuking planets" that featured an image of Kim Jong Un <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>.

## Privacy Concerns in Mobile Gaming

The extensive nature of mobile game advertising raises [[privacy_and_data_protection_in_mobile_gaming | privacy and data protection in mobile gaming]] concerns. Mobile games can track user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>, and in some regions like the US, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can legally sell browsing history to advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. To protect online privacy, using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is recommended, as it creates a secure tunnel for internet traffic and can mask a user's location from ISPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>.

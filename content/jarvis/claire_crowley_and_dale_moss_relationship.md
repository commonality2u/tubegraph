*The Bachelorette* is described as a "marriage game show" where a single individual dates 30 people at once with the goal of finding a partner for marriage [00:00:04]. Given 24 hours in a day, this equates to approximately 48 minutes per person per day, which is deemed by some scientists as enough time to fall in love [00:00:13].

## Claire Crawley's Season Overview

A few months prior to this discussion, [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire Crawley]] made headlines for becoming the oldest Bachelorette at 39 years old, though the show portrayed her as much older [00:00:32].

### Initial Controversy and Casting
Upon the announcement of [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] as the Bachelorette, the cast of 30 men was revealed. It was noted that many of the men were very young, leading to public criticism that ABC, despite patting itself on the back for casting an older Bachelorette, was setting her up with "25-year-old stud muffins" [00:00:53]. In response, ABC reportedly fired some younger contestants and hired slightly older ones [00:01:22].

### COVID-19 Impact and Production Changes
The season faced significant delays and changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic [00:02:26]. The entire production was moved to La Quinta Resort, meaning the usual global travel for dates was replaced with staying in one location [00:02:29]. The show even dramatized the contestants' mandatory quarantine and COVID-19 testing as a major plot point [00:05:08]. The editing made it seem as though [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] was enduring immense hardship during her quarantine, despite being in a rented resort [00:06:45]. Chris Harrison, the host, was even shown delivering [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]]'s COVID-19 test results [00:07:15].

## The Rise of Dale Moss

Despite the initial fanfare around [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]]'s age and the COVID-related delays, the season quickly became centered around Dale Moss [00:02:47]. Rumors began circulating that [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] would leave the show early with a cast member [00:01:38], which culminated in the announcement of Tayshia Adams as a second Bachelorette [00:01:48].

### An Instant Connection
From the very first episode, it was apparent that [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] had an immediate and overwhelming connection with Dale [00:09:39]. She stated, "I feel like I just met my husband" after their first interaction [00:10:01]. The show's editing made it clear that [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] would choose Dale, showing it in "a hundred different ways" within the first few minutes [00:09:50].

### Dale's Character and Perception
Dale is portrayed as physically attractive but doesn't offer much in terms of depth or unique character traits [00:11:39]. His dialogue often consists of generic, "canned phrases" or platitudes, described as sounding like an "NPC in a role-playing game" or a "hallmark card" [00:11:51]. For example, during a "words of affirmation" group date, while other contestants read poetry, Dale simply stated, "I'm here, and I'm here" [00:12:22]. His declarations of commitment, like "I'm committed to giving you everything I have, like physically, emotionally" after just meeting [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]], were seen as strange and overly intense for a first impression [00:12:45].

> [!info] Double Standard
> [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] criticized another contestant for not knowing enough about her to express what he liked about her, despite Dale having said very little of substance about her himself [00:13:36].

### Disregard for Other Contestants
[[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]]'s focus on Dale led to her giving minimal attention to the other men [00:14:20]. During a physical touch date, her interactions with other men were light, but with Dale, she immediately engaged in deep intimacy in front of everyone [00:14:27]. Dale also frequently interrupted other contestants' time with [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]], often by claiming he was just "roaming" or asking for a quick chat, only to monopolize her for hours [00:19:16].

### The "Roast Date" and Claire's Defense
The other men's frustration with Dale culminated in a "roast date" where, instead of roasting each other or [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]], they largely roasted Dale [00:20:58]. [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] took significant offense to this, aggressively defending Dale and interrogating contestants about their comments [00:21:13]. This behavior, including her demanding kindness towards Dale and referring to him as her "husband" and "the father of my child" [00:21:22], further alienated the other men.

## Claire and Dale's Exit

The extreme focus on Dale led to [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] making the unprecedented decision to cut her season short [00:01:36].

### Rose Ceremony and Departure
At the end of the roast date, [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] controversially gave the rose to herself instead of one of the men [00:21:52]. This moment reportedly signaled to ABC producers that the season needed to be wrapped up quickly to bring in Tayshia [00:21:56]. [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] then decided to leave the show with Dale [00:22:03].

### Breaking the News to the Other Contestants
[[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] gathered the 29 remaining men to inform them she had found what she came for with Dale [00:22:08]. Most of the men reacted with understandable frustration [00:22:14]. One contestant, Kenny, demanded an apology from [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] for allegedly "faking it" and not admitting her feelings for Dale from the first night [00:22:51]. [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] responded with a "famous speech" about not apologizing for love, stating, "I'll apologize if I wasted your time, I'll apologize if I hurt you, but I'm not gonna apologize for love" [00:23:31].

### Dale's Proposal
Chris Harrison then heavily pressured Dale to propose to [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]], implying that the show was ready to move on to Tayshia [00:24:02]. Dale proposed to [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]], solidifying their relationship and their departure from the show [00:24:19].

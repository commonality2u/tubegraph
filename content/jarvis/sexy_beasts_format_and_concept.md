*Sexy Beasts* is a Netflix dating show that introduces a unique twist to the genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It joins Netflix's existing roster of dating hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, such as *Love Is Blind*, by attempting to challenge traditional dating and dating apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Premise and Origin

The show's core concept involves contestants sporting elaborate [[makeup_and_prosthetics_in_sexy_beasts | makeup and prosthetics]] to appear as "beasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The stated aim is to put "true blind date chemistry to the test" and move away from superficial dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. *Sexy Beasts* on Netflix is based on an original British show of the same name that aired on BBC Three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Critiques of the Premise

The show's attempt to focus on personality is questioned, as it only conceals the face, leaving eyes visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The definition of a "beast" on the show is noted as "very loose," including characters like witches, statue men, pandas, and boiling trolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This range leads to inconsistencies, with some masks being "cute" and others "boiling" or "gross," undermining the idea of removing superficiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The show faces [[critiques_on_reality_tv_show_formats_and_stereotypes | criticism]] for still being superficial, as contestants are eliminated based on their "beast" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

The show's premise of falling in love based on personality alone is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, particularly when compared to other shows like [[love_is_blind_show_format_critique | *Love Is Blind*]], which was considered a better (though still "stupid") test of this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Social media reception for the show was largely negative, with trailers receiving a "healthy like to dislike ratio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Show Format

*Sexy Beasts* follows a format similar to MTV's *Next*, rather than the more interconnected format of *Love Is Blind* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Each episode features a single main "beast" who goes on dates with three other "beasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

The episode structure is as follows:
1.  **First Date**: A basic "bar date" with all three potential matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
2.  **First Elimination**: One "beast" is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
3.  **Second Date**: A more in-depth date with the remaining two "beasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. These dates sometimes seem uneven in their romantic potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
4.  **Final Decision**: The main "beast" chooses their preferred partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
5.  **Reveal**: Both chosen contestants remove their masks to reveal their true appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Notably, all contestants are "normal regular everyday models" and "very attractive," ranging from professional dancers and models to professional athletes and models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The show's narrative structure suggests that the two dates and decision process occur on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## Character Dynamics and Narratives

The show features a "snarky Netflix narrator" who attempts to provide comedic commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The [[contestants_and_relationship_dynamics | contestants]] often share generic stories, such as having been shy in the past but now being confident enough to appear on a dating show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

One notable character, "Rhino Man" (Mick), is portrayed as a "holistic health practitioner from LA" who describes himself as a "techno prince warrior poet monkey man spiritual cowboy on the hero's journey to liberate humankind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. His dialogue often includes abstract and unusual phrases, such as "sex kung fu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a> and performing spontaneous meditation on a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Despite his odd behavior, he is sometimes chosen by the main "beast," further highlighting the show's unpredictable dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Production and Visuals

The [[makeup_and_prosthetics_in_sexy_beasts | makeup and prosthetics]] are praised for their quality, noting that the team behind the original BBC show returned for the Netflix version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. However, some mask designs are critiqued for being too "uncanny" or "humanoid," making them less appealing than full animal or monster designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The show utilizes a mansion for eliminations, which appears underused given the isolated nature of the dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

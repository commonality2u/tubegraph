Tayshia Adams was introduced as the second Bachelorette for a season that initially featured [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire Crowley]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This announcement significantly overshadowed [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire Crowley's]] time as the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Background and Transition
Tayshia Adams was a contestant on [[overview_of_the_bachelor | Colton's season of The Bachelor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Rumors began circulating that [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] would leave the show early with one of the cast members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This "bubbled to a head" with the news that a second Bachelorette, Tayshia Adams, would be cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The show's editing seemed to facilitate [[producers_role_in_creating_drama_on_the_bachelor | Claire's]] departure and Tayshia's arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. Producers reportedly decided to "wrap this sh*t up" and "get Tasha in here stat" after [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire]] gave the rose to herself during a group date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:56">[02:21:56]</a>.

## Tayshia's Role and Reception
Tayshia "inherited this pile of broken men" from [[claire_crowley_as_the_oldest_bachelorette | Claire's]] season and had to "pick up the pieces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. She is described as a "rational nice person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a> and "the biggest catch the Bachelor's ever had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

Despite her positive attributes, promotional material for Tayshia's season raised concerns. Promos depicted some of the contestants not being excited about Tayshia, which was seen as a manipulative editing choice, given her popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. There were also concerns about her appearance in a "newspaper gown" in promos, questioning why producers didn't provide a designer dress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The show's overall reliance on "smoking mirrors" through its [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | editing]] was highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

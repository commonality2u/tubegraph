Currently, there is widespread dissatisfaction with Instagram, primarily because the app, once centered around photos, is now attempting to emulate video-focused platforms like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift is not unique to Instagram, as platforms like YouTube and Facebook are also increasingly adopting vertical video feeds reminiscent of TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Instagram's Evolution and Business Strategy

Instagram's [[history_and_evolution_of_instagram | history and evolution]] began in 2010 as a mobile check-in app, similar to Foursquare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. To avoid direct competition with Foursquare, it quickly pivoted to focus on photo sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The inclusion of photo filters, a breakthrough idea, allowed users to easily enhance their pictures, leading to its rapid success and eventual acquisition by Facebook (now Meta) for $1 billion in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Since the original founders' departure, Instagram has become increasingly like Facebook, serving as a key driver of relevance for the parent company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This has manifested in a strategy of [[competition_and_feature_copying_by_instagram | competition and feature copying]], where Instagram frequently adopts popular features from other apps to stay relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### A History of Feature Copying
Instagram has a history of incorporating features from competitors:
*   **Vine:** Introduced 15-second looping videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Snapchat:** Copied disappearing messages and famously [[competition_and_feature_copying_by_instagram | stole the "Stories" feature]], significantly impacting Snapchat's user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **BeReal:** Is currently testing a dual-camera feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **TikTok:** Instagram made a dedicated TikTok clone app called Lasso, which failed, leading them to integrate similar video features directly into Instagram as "Reels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Instagram Reels have now replaced all video uploads, forcing any video content to become a Reel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## User and Creator Dissatisfaction

The current major push towards Reels and algorithmic feeds has led to significant [[reactions_to_instagrams_algorithm_and_feature_changes | reactions to Instagram's algorithm and feature changes]].

### The "Make Instagram Instagram Again" Movement
Influential figures like Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian reposted a message from artist Tati Brunning, stating "Make Instagram Instagram Again" and advocating for a return to its photo-centric roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This post garnered about 2 million likes and spurred a Change.org petition with over 300,000 signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

The petition's core demands included bringing back chronological timelines and prioritizing photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. However, critics argue that the notion of Instagram always being a "real-time" photo-sharing app is false, as it has always been a "vain vanity app" where users presented idealized versions of themselves or highly filtered photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The loudest complainants, including the Kardashians, often have substantial financial incentives tied to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Impact on Content Creators
The [[impact_of_online_fame_and_popularity_on_content_creation | impact of online fame and popularity on content creation]] is significantly affected by these changes. Content creators, especially photographers, express deep frustration because the ever-shifting algorithm makes it harder to reach their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

*   **Prioritization of Reels:** A personal observation found that 50% of the feed consisted of Reels, effectively halving the visibility for photo content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   **Suggested Content:** 80% of the Reels in the feed were suggested posts from accounts not followed by the user, further reducing exposure for friends' content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **Forced Adaptation:** Photographers feel compelled to create "cringy Reels" to get their art seen, as the platform is actively shifting away from static photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **James Charles's Point:** As stated by James Charles, a beauty influencer, "The reason there's so much growth for videos is because we're being forced to post video. The performance of our photos just tank more than 90%, so creators are switching to video not because they want to, but because we're being told it's the only chance to grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

## Instagram's Response and Underlying Motivations

Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, addressed the concerns in a video, calling the full-screen feed a "test" and reiterating support for photos while acknowledging that Instagram would "become more and more video over time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. He also defended recommendations as a way to discover new content and help creators reach more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

However, this messaging is perceived as public relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>:
*   **Profit Motive:** The primary driver for these changes is to keep users on the app longer to view more ads, thereby increasing revenue and share prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
*   **Manipulating Engagement:** By making 50% of the feed video, Instagram actively biases engagement towards video content, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that "people like video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **Selective Creator Support:** When Instagram states it supports "creators," it predominantly refers to video creators, as photo creators are not seeing their content recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **De-prioritizing User Preference:** Instagram offers alternatives like a "following feed" for users who prefer to see content from accounts they follow, but it is not the default, indicating a deliberate push towards the algorithmic, video-heavy main feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

Instagram's strategic shift toward video content, driven by the [[influence_of_apps_like_tiktok_on_instagram | influence of apps like TikTok on Instagram]] and a clear profit motive, has fundamentally altered the user experience and significantly impacted content creators. While users and creators have vocalized their dissatisfaction, the company's loyalty lies with its shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. The "Reels experiment" appears to be working for Instagram, leading to increased engagement and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This means creators must adapt to platform changes, or risk reduced visibility, as platforms often change their business models without allegiance to their users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

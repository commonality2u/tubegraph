The social media platform Reddit, particularly the subreddit r/relationships, is a frequent source of viral discussions concerning [[unusual_relationship_stories | unusual relationship stories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. While many sensational posts gain traction on Twitter, the subreddit itself fosters a generally supportive community for those seeking advice in both romantic and non-romantic relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Common Tropes in Viral Posts
A recurring pattern in many viral posts from r/relationships involves a story describing a relationship that is "perfect and normal" in every way, except for one highly unusual or deal-breaking detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Examples of this format include:
*   "This guy is perfect... he's nice, charming, funny, she's amazing in bed and the last thing is he wants me to call him senpai during sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Notable Subreddit Posts and Dynamics

### Game of Thrones Spoiler Revenge
One widely discussed post involved a man who cheated on his girlfriend, leading her to unblock him every week to send him *Game of Thrones* spoilers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Despite the initial appearance of [[Reddit relationship advice | Reddit relationship advice]] holding people accountable, an interview with the man revealed he didn't understand why people weren't willing to help him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### The Yawn Thief
A particularly strange story that inspired discussion involved a boyfriend who would get upset if his girlfriend didn't "give" him her yawns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This involved him putting his mouth to hers and inhaling as she exhaled a yawn, which he referred to as "taking her yawns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. He would become offended if she covered her mouth or turned away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### The Hegel Obsession
Another post detailed a marriage strained by the husband's academic philosophy career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The wife, a physicist, described her husband's work as "completely insane" and containing "claims about physics that are just wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The husband:
*   Expected his wife to seriously engage with his work, despite her being a hard scientist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   Was "in love with a 19th-century German philosopher named Hegel," keeping a framed picture of him on the nightstand and even changing his phone background to Hegel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   Used inscrutable jargon and dismissed his native German-speaking wife with incorrectly pronounced German phrases, claiming Hegel could only be understood in the original German, despite not speaking it himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

### Other Brief Mentions
Further examples of unusual relationship scenarios appearing on Reddit include:
*   A wife calling her husband "Phil" during sex, despite his name being Elijah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   A husband wanting to live on a boat, despite his wife's known aversion to them before marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   A boyfriend who constantly looks at [[Reddit relationship advice | Reddit]] even while kissing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### The Magician's Restaurant
A particularly elaborate story detailed a husband's new obsession with magic, inspired by a friend named Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. After only four months of interest, the husband proposed quitting his job and using all family savings to start a restaurant "for magicians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

The restaurant concept included:
*   Magical props like levitating tables, bending cutlery, and torn and restored menus visible to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   Meals containing a specific playing card secreted inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   Waiters trained to always say "7 of hearts" when asked to think of a card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

The restaurant's core idea was to enable men on dates, "who were in on the scheme," to impress companions with seemingly spontaneous magic tricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The wife expressed concern over the husband's clouded judgment and fixation on Chris, fearing the business's inability to support their family of four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Advice for such a scenario, whether real or fabricated, includes open communication or, humorously, consulting a warlock to break a spell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

Pranks, defined as a "funny little trick" played on a friend, ideally result in a harmless goof where both parties can share a good laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, pranks on TikTok, in particular, often deviate from this ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Pranks on TikTok: A Critique

While some argue that TikTok lacks creativity and talent, the platform does feature many interesting individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This generally doesn't apply to pranks, which are described as "pretty some takes" and unavoidable, ranging from fake to real, and even a combination of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### The "Challenge" Pranks

A prominent style of prank on TikTok involves "challenge" videos, popularized by Australian creators Jackson O'Doherty and Kristen Han B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. These often involve one friend saying a random phrase, like "get rid of it," leading the other to begrudgingly perform an obnoxious act, usually a public disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

For instance, a common scenario involves throwing a freshly made Subway sandwich on the ground, making a mess while the employee looks on in horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The pranked individual often appears genuinely upset, begging the question of who the joke is on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Another example includes throwing a glass bottle of liquor on the ground, potentially injuring those nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

These pranks frequently use hashtags like #funny (obvious) and #friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The use of #friends is seen as ironic, given the nature of the pranks, with some suggesting these types of videos show a "worse example of friendships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. These creators are also large on Instagram, where they flex and display content, including harassing people in jockstraps, that isn't on their TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

Imitators of this style exist, such as a couple who performed a prank during a marriage proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Michael Fallon TV's "Comedy Sketches"

Another prominent TikTok prankster, Michael Fallon TV, considers himself a comedian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. His content has been criticized for being distasteful, such as a sketch titled "when you pick up a disabled hitchhiker," which was deemed too offensive to be shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

Other pranks by Fallon include:
*   **"That friend who's always on their phone..."**: This prank involves throwing a friend's phone into oncoming traffic, despite being fake, it's considered a "bad idea" due to depicting danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **"How to stop someone from eating unhealthy"**: This prank involves knocking food out of someone's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **"How to stop someone from over exercising"**: Similarly, this involves knocking someone off exercise equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **"Dare or get slapped"**: These videos show immediate, often nonsensical and publicly disruptive, compliance to dares rather than choosing to be slapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Examples include stealing a bike and riding it into a river, or acting like a monkey on a table, disrupting others like someone trying to take a phone call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## The Difficulties and Dangers of Pranking

It is argued that making a *good* prank is "very difficult" and "nearly impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Success depends on many variables, including the pranked individual's sense of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. A prank can easily become harassment if it goes too far, but if it's too easy, it can be boring and lack stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Despite being harmless and clearly a joke, they were suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

People are willing to take risks for pranks, often for the potential of gaining TikTok followers, which is seen as a fleeting reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### Examples of Problematic Pranks

Many TikTok pranks oscillate between "way too intense and comically underwhelming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>:
*   **Raw Pasta Cracking**: A popular prank involves chewing raw pasta to simulate cracking bones, often done in public to gauge reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. While seemingly harmless, its purpose is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Loud Music Over Intercoms**: Playing loud music, such as "Hit or Miss," over a Walmart intercom system, is criticized for harassing employees who are simply doing their job, potentially causing them fear of losing their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This highlights [[ethics_of_using_technology_for_social_manipulation | the ethics of using technology for social manipulation]].
*   **Staging Criminal Acts**: Videos depicting "robbing a bank lol #featureme #haha" are shared, trivializing criminal activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Destroying Property**: Pranks involving taking a friend's phone out of their pocket and destroying it are also shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   **Fake Harm**: Pranks like "accidentally murdering your sibling" (with pasta cracking as bone sounds) or spilling hot oil on a friend (fake), and spilling wine on a friend's clothes are considered "dumb" and pointless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

## Reflection on Prank Culture

Observing these types of pranks leads to a feeling of not having learned anything and a sense of disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Many creators seem driven by the pursuit of a "dopamine hit" from viral attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. For some, watching these videos highlights a personal shift, where pranks are no longer found funny, questioning if this is a normal part of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

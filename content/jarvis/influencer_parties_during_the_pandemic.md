During a sweeping pandemic, a new phenomenon dubbed "Foam C" (Fear Of Missing Clout) has emerged, affecting young YouTubers and TikTok creators who continue to party despite public health warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This behavior is seen as a drive for "clout" and maintaining their online presence, leading to numerous controversial gatherings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

## Prominent Examples of Influencer Parties

### Jake Paul's Controversies

Jake Paul, a prominent YouTuber, claimed 2020 was his "biggest year of growth" and that he had learned a lot about himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, his actions quickly contradicted these statements.

He took a public stance against YouTube for "holding him accountable for his actions," accusing the platform of "shadow banning" him and punishing him for being a "riskiest creator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Paul compared himself to a bull trying to enter a china shop, suggesting YouTube was preventing him from creating "dangerous content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Jake Paul gained notoriety for hosting large parties at his California mansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Footage from one such event showed partygoers "precariously dangling from an excavator" and falling to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Crucially, attendees were observed not wearing masks or social distancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Following his party, fellow creator Tanner Fox, who attended, tested positive for coronavirus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. A concerning moment captured a conversation where Paul and Fox initially laughed about the diagnosis, with someone in the background yelling, "we don't care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## The Rise of [[influencer_houses_and_their_impact_on_youth_culture|Creator Houses]]

A significant driver of these gatherings has been [[influencer_houses_and_their_impact_on_youth_culture|creator houses]], predominantly involving TikTok influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Noteworthy examples include Hype House, Sway House, and Alpha House <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

*   **Alpha House** launched during the pandemic and quickly set a "speed run record for fastest time from house creation to quarantine party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Neighbors and anonymous sources reported parties almost every night, with one event hosting approximately 150 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The house primarily consists of 17 and 18-year-old influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Hype House** gained notoriety for its "quarantine ragers," with attendees like Emma Chamberlain, James Charles, the D'Amelio sisters, and the Sway Boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. They were criticized for not wearing masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Influencers frequently defend their partying by claiming it's part of their "job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Thomas Petrou, a presumed founder of Hype House, stated, "Our jobs are to entertain people... We can't put our entire lives on hold for a year and not make any money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Other Influential Groups

*   **Sway Gaming**: Despite its name, Sway Gaming is a house primarily used for hosting parties and reportedly does not involve playing games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. It appears to be a "clout chase" on the name of Sway House and was reportedly created by the individual behind the Reaction Time channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Nelk Boys**: This Canadian group gained attention for traveling the country to spread pranks and, unintentionally, coronavirus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. They staged a controversial protest against gym closures, with one member, Steve Will Do It (impersonating Fred Flintstone), and his trainer Bradley, leading a street demonstration involving binge drinking and other questionable acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Their videos have also been criticized for including jokes making light of sexual assault and operating around a "token black guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

## Consequences and Reactions

Many influencers faced criticism and issued apologies for attending these parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. However, it is suggested that these apologies are often made "to save face," as many continue to attend parties the following weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

Despite the prevailing behavior, some influencers, like Dixie D'Amelio (who is 19), have spoken out against attending such gatherings, although this stance came after her own birthday party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

### Bryce Hall's 21st Birthday

Bryce Hall of Sway House hosted a large 21st birthday party, attracting many guests including the Nelk Boys and FaZe Banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. The party featured male strippers dressed as police officers, and actual police later showed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. Hall's public persona aims to convey an image of "authenticity" and not caring about consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

The motivation behind continued partying is attributed to a perceived lack of consequences and the pursuit of "clout" and "merch" sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. Influencers see their brand as a "reality show in real life" that cannot be paused for a pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

The Mayor of Los Angeles has threatened to cut off water and power to [[influencer_houses_and_their_impact_on_youth_culture|creator houses]] if they continue to party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. Bryce Hall's house did experience a power shut-off, to which he responded with a detached "we deserve it, it is illegal, but we deserve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. His followers congratulated him for not having coronavirus, missing the larger point about violating [[public_health_risks_of_gatherings_during_covid19|social distancing]] rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

Ultimately, despite public awareness that these gatherings pose a [[public_health_risks_of_gatherings_during_covid19|public health risk]], many influencers continue to party, prioritizing their careers and "clout" over safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

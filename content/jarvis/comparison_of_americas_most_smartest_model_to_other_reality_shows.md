From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The show [[overview_of_americas_most_smartest_model_show | *America's Most Smartest Model*]] explores the premise of whether attractive models can also possess intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It takes 16 models at various career stages and challenges them to be both beautiful and smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Blending Formats
The show is described as a hybrid of *America's Next Top Model* and *Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Contestants face unusual challenges that merge physical appeal with trivia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, such as:
*   A spelling bee where words are foreign fashion brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   A runway walk requiring contestants to list different types of trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   A runway walk requiring listing items from random categories like "things that are soft" or "world leaders dead or alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

### Critique of Challenges
These challenges are criticized for not genuinely testing intelligence, often instead shaming models for their bodies and intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The show is seen as "shameful" and "based on being mean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The knowledge of random trivia, like questions about American history given to non-American contestants, has no bearing on actual intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## Portrayal of Contestants and Relationships
In contrast to [[comparison_with_other_dating_shows_like_the_bachelor | other dating shows like *The Bachelor*]], where contestants might build relationships despite competing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, [[overview_of_americas_most_smartest_model_show | *America's Most Smartest Model*]] lacks camaraderie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Contestants are consistently depicted as being "at each other's neck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a> and "catty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

The show's production is perceived to deliberately make contestants appear cocky, playing into stereotypes associated with models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

```ad-warning
The show is characterized by its [[negative_portrayal_of_models_and_contestants_in_reality_television | negative portrayal of models and contestants in reality television]], constantly overusing stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This includes body shaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, portraying an ADHD contestant as "off the walls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, and labeling a former Playboy model as a "porn star" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
```

## Host and Judge Behavior
The judges on [[overview_of_americas_most_smartest_model_show | *America's Most Smartest Model*]] are consistently mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, with the intention of being "evil" akin to a "Simon Cowell of the show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. They appear to "feed off of breaking the spirit of these young hopeful models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

One of the hosts, Ben Stein, is criticized for constantly "fawning over the female contestants" and engaging in a "creepy old guy bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, which is described as "nasty" and "gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Reality TV Tropes
[[critiques_on_reality_tv_show_formats_and_stereotypes | *America's Most Smartest Model*]] incorporates common, questionable reality TV tropes:
*   **Human Rights Violations**: Bathrooms and refrigerators are locked behind trivia questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **Forced Conflict**: The show seems designed to foster animosity rather than community among contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Manipulative Editing**: Producers are believed to heavily influence contestants' actions and words, shaping their narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. For example, a contestant like Gaston, who makes inappropriate comments, is continually shown for his offensive behavior by producers who "play into this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Abrupt Eliminations**: Two contestants are eliminated within the first five minutes of the show, seemingly to "break down as many people's self-confidence as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

## Overall Impression
The show is seen as indicative of reality television from 2007, where creators "could just say anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. Despite its perceived cruelty and [[critique_of_reality_tv_and_its_portrayal_of_relationships | negative portrayal of relationships]], it is acknowledged as being "fun to watch because it's so horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

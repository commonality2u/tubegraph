The year 2020 saw a significant cybersecurity breach involving Twitter, which the speaker described as "nearly the worst case scenario for for a website like Twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This incident highlighted critical vulnerabilities, particularly concerning [[the_role_of_internal_tools_and_support_staff_in_online_security | internal tools]] and the human element.

## The 2020 Twitter Hacking Incident

On July 15, 2020, Twitter experienced a "gigantic hack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a> where scammers gained control of "the world's most influential Twitter accounts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. These accounts included world leaders, entertainers, brands, and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, such as Barack Obama, Kanye West, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Mr. Beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. The attackers used these compromised accounts to promote a Bitcoin scam, promising to double any money sent to a specific, untraceable, and irreversible Bitcoin address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

The scam message was nearly identical across all compromised accounts: "We've decided to give back to our community all bitcoins sent to our address will be sent back double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. While the scam netted over $100,000 from about 400 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, it could have caused much greater damage, such as manipulating stock markets through fake announcements from influential figures like Jeff Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. This event led to [[public_perceptions_and_reactions_to_social_media_platform_vulnerabilities | Twitter]] disabling tweeting capabilities for all verified accounts for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## How the Hack Occurred: Social Engineering

Early reports suggested that [[the_use_of_extreme_content_for_social_media_engagement | social engineering]] was the method of compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. This is described as a "fancy term for saying someone inside a Twitter was either tricked or paid off by the bad guys to do their dirty work for them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. The speaker expressed hope that it was trickery rather than an employee being paid off, stating that "a slice of 100k is worth the immense amount of personal risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a> is not a good trade-off.

### Exploiting Internal Tools

The attackers gained access to Twitter's [[the_role_of_internal_tools_and_support_staff_in_online_security | internal tools]] primarily used by support staff to manage accounts, troubleshoot issues, and take over accounts for legitimate purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. This access, which needs to be "locked down" and "treated with a lot of care and Trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>, was reportedly exploited by the hackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. Twitter responded by suspending accounts that tweeted screenshots of the internal tool, seemingly to prevent further exposure of their security vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

## Twitter's Past Security Issues and Warnings

The speaker points out that Twitter had previous warnings regarding internal access vulnerabilities. For instance, two years prior to the hack, a support staff member intentionally deleted Donald Trump's account as an act of protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. This incident led Twitter to implement "extra safeguards" for Trump's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. Additionally, there were reports of employees being "paid off to steal Twitter secrets and report them to the Saudi government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. These past events suggest that Twitter had "enough warnings and trial runs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a> to prevent such a widespread hack.

The speaker highlights that more established companies have already learned the lesson that access to user accounts must be protected, citing examples like rogue Google employees spying on search history or Uber's "god mode" tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Recommendations

The incident underscores the importance of robust security measures and vigilance:

*   **User Vigilance:** "If something seems too good to be true, it is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This fundamental principle can help users avoid scams.
*   **Corporate Responsibility:** Companies, especially mature ones like Twitter, must invest in security infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. This includes protecting [[the_role_of_internal_tools_and_support_staff_in_online_security | internal tools]] and safeguarding support employees who are susceptible to scams and coercion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
*   **Proactive Security Testing:** Companies serious about security should conduct "consistent tests internally for things like phishing attempts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a> to educate employees on risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that a company of Twitter's maturity should not be experiencing a "string of issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a> like this. The incident is a stark reminder of the continuous need for strong cybersecurity practices and the [[importance_of_maintaining_ethical_boundaries_in_tech_innovation | ethical responsibility]] that companies hold to protect their users.

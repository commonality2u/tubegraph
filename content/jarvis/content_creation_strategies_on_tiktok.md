TikTok has emerged as a platform where diverse content creation strategies are employed to gain traction and viewership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. While traditional TikTok content often involves dancing and lip-syncing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, success on the platform can also be achieved through unconventional or even controversial approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Leveraging Trends and Shock Value
A notable strategy involves latching onto existing trends and memes and injecting a shocking or uncomfortable element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. For instance, some creators have gained popularity by participating in "sibling trends" and then adding a controversial twist, such as a kiss between step-siblings, to generate discomfort and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This deliberate choice aims to make the content go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

Other content creation methods observed include:
*   **Relationship-based POVs and Sketches** TikTok has become a platform for point-of-view (POV) videos and sketches that often depict unusual or even abusive relationship dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. These short, dramatic scenarios, typically under 60 seconds, focus on "bad habits" within relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Controversial Relationship Narratives** Some creators build their content around the controversy of their relationship status, such as a step-sibling couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This strategy appears to be a calculated move to stand out, even if it draws criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **The "Alpha" Persona** Some creators adopt an "alpha" male persona, often depicted through aggressive or possessive actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This can involve wearing costumes, using specific catchphrases like "the alpha is back," and performing actions such as mock-punching or overly forceful gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **"Baby Voice" and Costumes** Popularity on TikTok doesn't always require traditional dancing or lip-syncing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Some creators use a "baby voice" and readily available costumes as key elements of their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Addressing Audience Criticism** Creators may directly address audience concerns or criticisms within their videos, which can be a way to maintain engagement and lean into the controversy that fuels their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Cliffhangers and Multi-Part Content** Some content creators use cliffhangers, promising a "part two" to keep viewers invested, even if the follow-up is delayed or changes direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Content Evolution and Challenges
Some creators start with more "normal" content, such as public service announcements or relatable scenarios like dancing while pumping gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. However, they may pivot to more provocative or controversial themes, often coinciding with significant events like the pandemic, to boost engagement and find what "works" on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.

However, content can also border on [[cultural_sensitivity_in_tiktok_videos | cultural insensitivity]], such as making Bollywood-style videos without being of Indian descent and justifying it by having Indian friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Normalizing toxic relationship behavior is also a concern with some content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Despite these issues, creators are often just trying to navigate the "weird media landscape" and find a successful niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

## The Impact on Consumer Behavior
The influence of TikTok extends beyond specific individuals, fostering a broader culture of impulsive and trend-driven purchasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Users are often compelled to buy items that "strike their fancy" after seeing them in short-form video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:59]</a>.

However, the experience of purchasing TikTok-advertised products can be varied. Some purchases might be satisfactory, while others may result in unexpected or impractical items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Consumers might also encounter issues like receiving an incorrect product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> or products that don't match their advertised functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Despite these potential pitfalls, the allure of viral products continues to drive [[consumer_behavior_and_brand_interactions_on_social_media | consumer behavior]] on social media.

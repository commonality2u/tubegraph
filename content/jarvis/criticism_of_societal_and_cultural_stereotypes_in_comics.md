This article discusses "Not Always Right Comics," an Instagram page featuring webcomics that are an offshoot of the "Not Always Right" website, which has been active since at least 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. The website provides a platform for people to submit stories where they complain about others who are "not always right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The comics claim to be user-submitted and real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, similar to animated story channels that often feature [[critique_of_fake_animated_stories | fake animated stories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## Self-Congratulatory Narratives

Many of these stories, even when the "other person is in the wrong," tend to be very self-congratulatory, seemingly existing for the narrator to "pat themselves on the back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This often results in scenarios where the person writing the story comes across as the "hero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The overall impression of these comics is one of "wish fulfillment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.

## Stereotypical Characters and Scenarios

The comics frequently feature an "entitled parent or customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a> who gets "owned" or "shown what's what" by the protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Many of the characters are depicted with specific visual cues, like certain haircuts, to signify their role as the antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### The Hypocritical "Karen"

A common archetype in these comics is the "Karen" character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>, often portrayed as a "helicopter parent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

*   **Tattoo Judgment:** One comic features a school worker with an ivy vine tattoo on their foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. A "Karen" character confronts the worker, claiming the tattoo could be a "gang symbol or related to drugs" and is "highly unprofessional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. The comic's "plot twist" reveals that the "Karen" herself has a "tramp stamp" tattoo of dolphins on her lower back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. While the comic portrays her as a hypocrite for judging someone else's tattoo while having one herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>, the narrator finds it problematic that the comic introduces a "hierarchy" of tattoos, implying one is "bad" and the other is morally superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. This scenario exemplifies [[judgment_and_hypocrisy_in_social_narratives | judgment and hypocrisy in social narratives]].

### The Racist Tourist

Another comic depicts a tourist in Hawaii who demands that a local speak English, stating they "just flew here from America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. The tourist also asks if they accept "American money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. The comic aims to "take down bigotry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>, but the scenario is deemed "unbelievable," as someone with knowledge of currency exchange would likely know Hawaii is part of the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. The implausibility of the story "undercuts the point" it's trying to make against racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. This story is an example of [[cultural_stereotypes_in_media | cultural stereotypes in media]] being used for a perceived moral lesson.

### The Entitled Parent

A comic about a "velcro wall" ride features another entitled parent who insists their child must ride before a troop leaves, despite a long line and the ride closing soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. The parent claims their son has a "lifelong dream" of being suspended by a velcro jumpsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. The comic ends with the mother being told to "speak to the clown over there," who is revealed to be the boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. The humor is found in the parent's unreasonable demands, which align with the "let me talk to a manager" trope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

### Tech Support Stereotypes

A significant portion of the comics focuses on tech support, which is portrayed as being "full of unreasonable and stupid people that don't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.

*   **The Sexist Caller:** One comic features a male caller who refuses to speak to a female tech support representative, demanding a "man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. The female agent is the only one who can help him, leading to him being "put in his place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. This comic is described as "owning the human personification of sexism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a> and is part of the comics being "woke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>, also touching upon [[commentary_on_stereotypical_masculinity | commentary on stereotypical masculinity]].

*   **The Impatient Businessman:** Another tech support story involves a businessman on a Caltrain from San Francisco to San Jose who demands internet access despite being in a maintenance zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. The tech support person, who is the only one working at 4 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>, tells him to wait 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>. The businessman ridiculously asks if the support person can "move the satellite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>. The humor comes from the businessman's "weak understanding of how the world works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.

*   **The Homophobic Caller:** A male caller attempting to connect an iPod to a stereo is told he needs a "3.5 millimeter male to male rca cable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>. He reacts with disgust, clarifying, "mail to mail as in boy to boy... that's disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>. The tech support person hangs up on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>. This comic is noted as hitting the "woke trifecta" of addressing racism, sexism, and homophobia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>.

*   **The DVD Player Incident:** A customer brings in a DVD player that isn't working, and it's discovered they inserted the DVD upside down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:36:00">[20:36:00]</a>. When the employee correctly inserts the disc, it blares a "grotesque scene of a cheesy porn" through the store's sound system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. The absurdity lies in the customer's apparent stupidity and the escalating, unbelievable nature of the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

While "Not Always Right Comics" may have "good intentions" in highlighting societal issues and difficult customer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>, their execution is often "goofy as hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. The insistence that these unbelievable scenarios are "real" is questioned, as fictional stories are acceptable as long as they are not presented as factual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>. The comics are criticized for their [[critiques_on_reality_tv_show_formats_and_stereotypes | reliance on stereotypes]] and [[representation_and_stereotypes_in_video_content | stereotypical representations]] to create satisfying "owning" moments for the protagonist, often resembling [[preachy_comics_on_instagram | preachy comics on Instagram]]. They are also noted for their similarity to [[critique_of_animated_story_channels | animated story channels]] that present fictional narratives as real submissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

The trend of brands adopting a "relatable" persona on social media platforms like Twitter has expanded beyond just food companies to encompass "literally everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This strategy involves brands engaging in various forms of [[corporate_humor_and_communication_on_social_media_platforms | corporate humor]] and self-aware content, aiming to connect with audiences through internet culture, including memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Evolution of Brand Personification on Social Media

The idea of brands personifying themselves on social media dates back to the early days of platforms like Twitter, where the expectation was to share personal activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. An early example is a Wendy's tweet from nine years ago, which humanized the brand by talking about drinking chocolate milk at home and pretending it's a Frosty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

While early brand tweets were relatable, they didn't involve creating memes or "roasting" fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The modern era of [[rise_of_meme_culture_among_fastfood_brands | meme culture among fast-food brands]] is often traced back to Denny's, which became famous for its presence on Tumblr.com around 2013, characterized by "weird words" and memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Notable Instances of Brands Using Humor and Memes

Numerous brands have leveraged humor and memes, often with varied results:

*   **Sunny D's "Cry for Help"** The orange drink brand, Sunny D, gained significant attention after live-tweeting the Super Bowl and posting "I can't do this anymore," which many on Twitter interpreted as a genuine cry for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This led to other brands like Pop-Tarts and MoonPie responding with support, creating a viral conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Elon Musk as a "Meme Lord"** Elon Musk, identified as the "world's richest meme Lord," has engaged in unusual online behavior, such as flirting with the official Twitter account for the planet Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Brand "Diss Tracks" and Odd Content** The Cheetos mascot, Chester Cheetah, released a diss track about Doritos, despite both being owned by the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Another instance includes a bizarre, unverified tweet from popcorn brand Orville Redenbacher giving toilet hygiene advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Personified Accounts** Even Twitter's own account tweets like a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, and video game characters like Sonic the Hedgehog have engaging Twitter presences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## The Strategy Behind Humor and Memes

[[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | Marketing strategies]] often cite humor as an effective message type that "tends to stand out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Marketing blogs highlight "clever language," "pop-culture references," and "meme jacking" as key components of using humor to build brand personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The goal is to create [[audience_engagement_and_internet_humor | audience engagement]] by being "ridiculously funny" and providing "valuable content that appeals to your interests and needs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Many people assume these accounts are run by marketing executives, but they are often managed by individuals seeking to appeal to younger audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

### The Human Element Behind Brand Accounts

The individuals running these brand accounts are often "regular ass people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. For example, the person behind Stay Calm's "super woke" Twitter account is just "a dude with a podcast" named Nathan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Amber Gordon, who was 23 during the Denny's social media rise, was so proficient at Tumblr that she was hired to manage their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. These individuals are often exercising "what little freedom they have and goofing around while trying to pay their rent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

## Critique and Purpose

While brands use humor and memes to increase sales through "shitposts," it's important to continue to "call them out for like weird advertising practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. However, it's also recognized that these strategies fulfill an existing need for entertainment and connection between consumers and [[brands_using_social_media_for_relatable_content | brands using social media for relatable content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. The "humanization of a given brand should never ever prevent someone from criticizing it," but harassment of the individuals running these accounts is discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

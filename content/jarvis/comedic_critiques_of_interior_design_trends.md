Jarvis Johnson and Chad Chad review TikTok videos that showcase bizarre and impractical home designs, offering [[interior_design_fails_and_humorous_commentary | humorous commentary]] and [[analyzing_tiktok_home_design_videos | critiques]] on the unrealistic and often dangerous solutions presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This series highlights an emerging trend of creating "awful rooms imaginable" through 3D rendering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## House Design 77: The "One Screw" Bunk Beds

One prominent TikTok account, "House Design 77," features designs with high production quality but questionable practicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Impractical and Dangerous Furniture
The videos frequently showcase [[exploring_odd_and_impractical_furniture_design | odd and impractical furniture design]], such as bunk beds secured by "one screw" in total, making them appear highly unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The beds also feature decorative, unattached bars that serve no functional purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The overall aesthetic of these beds is compared to "bunk hospital beds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Guillotine Beds and Infinite Children
Some designs include a bed mechanism that resembles a "guillotine," posing a direct danger to children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The concept of "infinity kids" is introduced, where an infinite number of children could theoretically fit into these bizarre, space-maximizing rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Morgue-Like Functionality
A recurring element is beds that slide out, prompting comparisons to a morgue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This unsettling feature, combined with other dangerous elements, leads to morbid humor, such as suggesting the beds are designed for "five minute murder" where users are "killed by the fan and then you're already in the morgue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, reminiscent of [[critique_of_five_minute_crafts | Five Minute Crafts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Uncanny Valley Characters and Unexpected Elements
The 3D animated characters in these videos exhibit an "uncanny valley" effect, sliding unnaturally instead of walking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The designs often feature jarring and illogical additions, such as a tiger cage that descends from the ceiling for "storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The inclusion of tiny desks and even a gym within an already cramped bedroom suggests a "Squid Game" or "Battle Royale" scenario for the children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## "Popular Toilet Design"

Another video with 60 million views, titled "Popular toilet design," demonstrates equally [[bizarre_and_impractical_diy_trends | bizarre and impractical DIY trends]] and design concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### Inefficient "Fixes" and Weaponized Incompetence
The video begins with an "angry" man in a shower and a woman with "bad posture" at a desk, setting up a problem that their "design" aims to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The "solution" involves inexplicably "unbuilding" walls to install new features, a process noted as unrealistic for construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. The design emphasizes hyper-efficiency, claiming it could save "30 seconds" by allowing multiple activities to happen simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

A memorable scene involves a woman fighting an alligator that appears in the bathroom, while a man pretends "weaponized incompetence" to avoid dealing with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

### The Floating Washing Machine
The video also attempts to "solve" the problem of cleaning under a washing machine by lifting it onto a higher shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. This "solution" is criticized for making the washing machine harder to access and move, requiring a "forklift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. The ultimate suggestion to keep the area clean is a "flying washing machine," which is then humorously countered by the problem of cleaning the ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

### Conclusion: "Popular" but Impractical
Despite the title, the final toilet design is considered common and not particularly "popular," as the toilet itself remains the same, only its location is changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## General Observations

These TikToks often lead viewers to believe that complex 3D renders are created by simple apps, rather than professional design work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Surprisingly, the TikTok account responsible for these interior design videos also promotes a beauty store, "Fio Beauty," suggesting a commercial interest behind the viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

Being a teenager can be characterized by "a lot of dramatic emotions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, as observed by the speaker. This period is often marked by intense feelings and a sense of "angsty" self-expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Online Portrayal of Teenage Romance

The speaker discovered numerous "love and romance themed instagrams" seemingly targeted at teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. These accounts, with names like "pointless existence" and "painful writings," feature content that is often "very moody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The concept of love presented in these memes appears to be heavily influenced by [[impact_of_pop_culture_on_teen_perceptions_of_love | pop music and bad Disney movies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, with even Drake's lyrics suggested as a partial influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Some memes promote a borderline "emo" perspective on love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, such as the statement "if you're not good-looking you have no rights to love someone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Common Themes in Romance Memes

Several recurring themes are observed in these online romance memes:

*   **Obsessive Devotion**
    Memes often depict love as an all-consuming force, where a person's entire life revolves around their partner. Examples include "missing you is my hobby, caring for you is my job, making you happy is my duty and loving you is my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The speaker cautions that if one's life is "consumed by relationships," it "doesn't end well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, and advises that individuals will be "happier if you've got your own stuff going on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> to avoid giving "control of your feelings to another person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **[[jealousy_and_insecurity_in_relationships | Jealousy and Insecurity]]**
    [[jealousy_and_insecurity_in_relationships | Jealousy]] is a "major theme" in these memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, often presented as an uncontrolled emotion: "jealousy when I see you with someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The speaker acknowledges that it can be "natural sometimes to feel jealous" but advises identifying the "inner insecurity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> and notes that [[jealousy_and_insecurity_in_relationships | jealousy]] is generally seen as an "unattractive trait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Some memes even express a "selfish" desire not to "share you with anyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, a sentiment compared to pop songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Unhealthy "Relationship Goals"**
    The concept of "relationship goals" is frequently featured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. One meme suggests wanting a relationship "like Tom and Jerry fight daily but still can't live without each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, which the speaker strongly advises against, noting that Tom and Jerry are "famous for trying to kill one another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Another meme depicts a conversation where one partner threatens to get a kiss from "that ugly who liked your status on Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, highlighting controlling or [[challenging_relationship_dynamics | challenging dynamics]] often presented as desirable goals in these memes.
*   **Dramatic and Unrealistic Scenarios**
    A prevalent topic is "pregnancy," often accompanied by "ridiculous story" scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. These stories frequently involve casual text announcements of pregnancy, immediate proposals, and the man expressing instant happiness and a desire for a specific gender baby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The narratives are often disjointed, with authors' notes inserted mid-story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
    Another meme portrays a proposal scenario where the woman questions the man's lack of material possessions (house, car, salary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, only for him to later reveal vast wealth after she leaves, concluding with the "moral" of not judging anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Engagement Tactics**
    Some accounts use tactics like asking users to "comment a word that's relevant to the story letter by letter" to increase engagement, which is noted as looking "really dumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Critique of Online Advice

The speaker offers [[critique_of_online_relationship_advice | criticism of the advice]] implied or directly stated in these memes. For example, he advises not to "read into pop lyrics" as a guide for relationships, suggesting "you're gonna be disappointed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. He also notes that these accounts are "super skeezy" and exist to sell ads, with disclaimers warning that the admins "don't take any responsibility" for products promoted and that some might "do fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

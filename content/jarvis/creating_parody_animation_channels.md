YouTube content creator Jarvis Johnson undertook an experiment to create a parody of popular [[clickbait_animation_channels | clickbait animation channels]] like "Actually Happened" and "My Story Animated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. His goal was to prove that these channels misled viewers by claiming their "extremely [[clickbait_animation_channels | clickbait]] stories" were submitted by kids, despite their own requirements for believability and sounding like real teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## The Parody Channel: "They Actually Animated My Story"

Johnson concluded that "the only way to fight these channels was to join them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. He launched his own fake story animation channel titled "They Actually Animated My Story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Key aspects of the parody channel:
*   **Original Stories** The channel featured "original" stories that were "not ripoffs of any existing works whatsoever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, satirically referencing popular works like *Harry Potter* (e.g., "Gary Trotter") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> and *The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air* (e.g., a boy named "Bill") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Growth and Reception** The channel gained 25,000 subscribers and thousands of views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. A notable outcome was the difficulty in distinguishing between genuine and satirical comments from viewers, leading to confusion about whether the channel was a joke or serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

> "This channel is clearly fake the narrator is the same for every video read more this is a joke okay you're a ripoff actually happened by the dabs are like last season losers it's dead guys I'm 100% sure this channel as a joke um there's no such thing as a teleporter lmao fake stole this idea from The Fresh Prince of bel-air and bill any real guy you just copy the main character's name from the show well but change it to bill idiots are these jokes are they real who can be sure irony is dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>

## [[Critique_of_animated_story_channels | Critique of Animated Story Channels]]

Johnson's broader [[analysis_of_fake_animated_story_channels | analysis of fake animated story channels]] highlighted several issues beyond just the authenticity of stories:

### Exploitative Practices by "My Story Animated"
"My Story Animated" posted a "quiz show" video that showcased animation clips from job applicants and asked viewers to guess if the person got hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This was seen as "shaming people who applied to work at their stupid company" and monetizing their failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The video was later taken down, likely due to poor performance rather than a change of conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Incoherent and Unbelievable Storylines from "Actually Happened"
Johnson reviewed several stories from "Actually Happened," illustrating their lack of detail, illogical plot points, and reliance on [[clickbait_animation_channels | clickbait]] titles that did not align with the actual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

#### Case Study: "I Faked Pregnancy to Get Good Grades"
*   **Premise:** Nancy, 14, procrastinates on a presentation, misses the bus, and accidentally drinks spoiled yogurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Plot Gaps:** During her presentation, she gets sick, and her friend Angela accidentally reads a random WebMD article about pregnancy because it was mistakenly mixed into Nancy's presentation papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Illogical Consequences:** Nancy then supposedly gains popularity, gets good grades, and is favored by teachers because everyone mistakenly believes she is pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Resolution:** A social worker gets involved, Nancy lies about being pregnant, and her mother's genuine morning sickness reinforces the lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Despite lying to officials, Nancy faces "no consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

#### Case Study: "I Thought I Was Smarter Than Burglars But Then I Got Trapped"
*   **Title Changes:** This video had at least three different [[clickbait_animation_channels | clickbait]] titles that were "all lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Premise:** Karla, 14, is a dog walker who discovers burglars at a client's house while without her phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Irrational Decisions:** Instead of calling the police from outside, she enters the house to use a landline, which is dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. She then finds a forgotten smartphone and calls her mother to tell her to call the police *in Spanish* to prevent the thieves from understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Rescue:** The dog magically breaks free to distract a criminal, and the police arrive just "in the nick of plot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Moral:** The story concludes with the owner calling Karla's actions "pretty stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, a sentiment Johnson agreed with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

#### Case Study: "My Friends Think I'm Dead"
*   **Lack of Details:** This story is criticized for having "basically no details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The protagonist's dad is involved in an unnamed crime, putting them in witness protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **Fabricated Witness Protection Elements:** The story claims the family had to fake their death and had a news story about them dying in a car crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Johnson notes that faking death is "not a thing" in the witness protection program, which typically involves changing identity and moving to a new city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This further confirms the [[authenticity_of_animated_story_channels | authenticity]] issues.

## Manufacturing [[Clickbait_animation_channels | Clickbait Animation Channels]] Content

Johnson analyzed the patterns in existing [[clickbait_animation_channels | clickbait animation channel]] titles to create a formula:
1.  **First-person perspective:** Starts with "I" or "My" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
2.  **Subject:** Involves the storyteller, their mom, dad, or crush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
3.  **Negative Event:** Must include something bad like death, crime, betrayal, or emotional manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

He then used a statistical modeling technique called **Markov chains** with titles from "Actually Happened" videos to generate new, non-existent but believable titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This process predicts the next word based on preceding words, similar to text suggestions on a phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

Examples of Markov chain-generated titles:
*   "My dad became an Instagram star overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>
*   "I almost drowned and lost all my money in a card game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>
*   "My girlfriend is a grandma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>
*   "I had a fake boyfriend but he taught me something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>
*   "My dad's last gift went missing and it killed their family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>
*   "My friends think I'm a vegetarian and my dad fucking crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>

Johnson also attempted to use **GPT-2**, a sophisticated language model, trained on subtitle files from "Actually Happened" videos to generate full scripts, but found it wasn't successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

After extensively engaging with and analyzing [[overview_of_animated_story_channels | animated story channels]], Johnson expressed his disdain for them and stated he would no longer cover the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. The overarching moral derived from this experiment and [[criticism_of_fake_animated_stories_on_youtube | criticism of fake animated stories on YouTube]] is to "be dubious of anything that purports to be real on the Internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.

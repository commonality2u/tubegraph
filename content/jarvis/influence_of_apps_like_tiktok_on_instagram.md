Users are currently frustrated with [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] because it is increasingly shifting away from its photo-sharing roots to emulate [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This trend is not unique to [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]]; other platforms like YouTube and Facebook are also incorporating features that mimic [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]]'s vertical video feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Much of the content seen on these "copycat" apps is recycled from [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Instagram's Evolution and Business Strategy

[[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] began in 2010 as a mobile check-in app, similar to Foursquare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. To avoid competing with Foursquare, its founders shifted the app's focus to photo sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. A key innovation came from Instagram founder Kevin Systrom's wife, who inspired the idea of photo filters to make photos look better, leading to the app's initial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

In 2013, Facebook acquired [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] for $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. After the original founders departed, [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] increasingly resembled Facebook, which relies on [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] to remain relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Facebook's strategy has been compared to Drake, "stealing from smaller artists to stay relevant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### History of Feature "Theft"

[[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] has a history of adopting features from other successful apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>:
*   **Vine:** Facebook (and later [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]]) introduced 15-second looping video to compete with [[comparison_of_tiktok_to_other_platforms_like_vine_and_musically | Vine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Snapchat:**
    *   Disappearing messages were created to compete with Snapchat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    *   [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] notoriously "stole" the Snapchat Stories feature, which significantly impacted Snapchat's user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **BeReal:** [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] copied BeReal's dual camera feature, which was in a testing phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **TikTok:**
    *   Facebook launched a standalone [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]] clone app called Lasso, but it failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   As a result, [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] integrated Reels directly into its app to force user adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. All videos uploaded to [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] now become Reels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Reels are prominently positioned within the app, with a dedicated tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## User Backlash: "Make Instagram Instagram Again"

Public dissatisfaction with [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users and_creators | Instagram]]'s shift intensified when powerful influencers like Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian reposted a message from artist Tati Brunning, stating, "Make [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] Again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This viral post received about 2 million likes, and a Change.org petition gathered 300,000 signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Key complaints in the petition and from users include:
*   **Loss of Chronological Timelines:** Users want to see posts from friends in chronological order, a common criticism also levied against Twitter and Facebook's algorithmic feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Shift from Photos to Video:** The petition calls for an algorithm that favors photos, arguing that [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]]'s original intention was photo sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Video was only added as a response to [[comparison_of_tiktok_to_other_platforms_like_vine_and_musically | Vine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Repetitive Content:** A significant concern is that most Reels are recycled [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]] content that users have already seen, lacking innovation or uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Ignoring Creators:** Critics argue that [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] is forcing creators to change their content direction to serve a new algorithm, despite having built livelihoods on the original photo-centric platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

The petition's sentiment is "corny" and unrealistic, as companies typically do not reverse major strategic changes based on such petitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Instagram's Response and Rationale

[[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]]'s CEO, Adam Mosseri, addressed the concerns, stating that the full-screen feed and video prioritization are "tests" aimed at making the experience more engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. He acknowledged that while photos would continue to be supported, more of [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] would "become video over time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Mosseri also defended "recommendations" (posts from unfollowed accounts) as a way to help users discover new content and assist creators in reaching wider audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

However, critics view Mosseri's explanations as "PR approved messaging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>:
*   **Controlled Environment:** [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] actively steers user behavior; by making 50% of the feed video content, they are "putting their thumb on the scale" to increase video consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **Increased Engagement:** More video content means users spend more time on the app, leading to higher engagement numbers and more ad views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Creator Support is Selective:** When Mosseri speaks of supporting creators, he implicitly means video creators, as photo creators are currently disadvantaged by the algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. Many photographers feel they are forced to make "cringy reels" to get their work seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

## Impact on Creators

The shift to a video-first, algorithmic feed makes it harder for creators, especially photographers, to reach their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. A survey of an [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] feed showed that 50% of posts were Reels, with 80% of those Reels being suggested content rather than posts from followed accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. This means half the potential viewership for photos is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Creators who adapt to Reels can experience significant growth due to the increased visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, but many feel forced into this change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

## Conclusion: Profit Motive and Future Outlook

Ultimately, [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]]'s changes are driven by the profit motive; the company aims to maximize profitability for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. The shift to [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]]-like features is seen as a "huge opportunity" for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] has no inherent loyalty to its users or its original identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>; it will adapt to whatever trend drives the most engagement and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

The strategy is to "hook" new users onto the app for longer periods, making them more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. While long-time users and creators may dislike the changes, the company believes enough casual users will adapt, ensuring the platform's continued success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. The Reels experiment appears to be working well for [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]], indicating that these changes are likely permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

[[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | Brands]] are an inescapable presence on social media, constantly engaging in various antics to capture attention. This phenomenon, which began with behaviors on platforms like Twitter, has expanded across all social media, shaping [[consumer_behavior_and_brand_interactions_on_social_media | consumer behavior]] and expectations regarding brand interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## [[brands_seeking_clout_and_attention | Brands Seeking Clout and Attention]]

Brands actively seek attention and free advertising on social media, often by directly engaging with creators or trending topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. They are described as "thirsty for clout" and willing to do anything for "sweet sweet attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This includes:
*   Brands directly replying to social media posts by creators, asking to be included in content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   Unexpected follows from brands like Velveeta Cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   Unsolicited engagement, such as Uno replying to a tweet about avoiding the game's actual rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   Brands being described as "super thirsty" for interaction, like Zaxby's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## [[the_humanization_and_personification_of_brands | The Humanization and Personification of Brands]]

A significant marketing strategy has been the push to turn [[brands_as_people_marketing_strategy | brands into people]], giving them relatable, specific personality traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This strategy has been largely successful, leading to a new expectation of brands being "absurd and weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The speaker observes that "the singularity is complete, we are one with the brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### "Brands are Just Like Us"
This segment highlights instances where brands mimic human behaviors:
*   **Wendy's Fan Fiction**: Wendy's started a Wattpad account, publishing romance stories like "The Lemonade Charade" and "The Forbidden Fruit Tea," attempting to empathize with the working people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Bagel Bites**: The brand's social media rarely tweets about its own product, behaving more like a regular user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Gaming Together**: Brands like Sunny D, Tatino's, Bugles, Gushers, and Chex Mix play "Among Us" together on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Emotional Support**: Brands offer support to others, such as Fall Guys comforting a "depressed" McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Brand-on-Brand Criticism**: Brands even criticize other brands' social media usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Personal DMs**: The Slim Jim account DMed the speaker to compliment their work, blurring the line between a brand and a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This raises questions about whether it's a "complicated marketing scheme" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Ridiculous Stunts and [[influence_of_sensational_content_on_viewer_engagement | Sensational Content]]

Beyond digital antics, brands engage in bizarre real-world stunts to gain attention:
*   **McDonald's Collaborations**: McDonald's cast a "curse" on Travis Scott, turning him into a Happy Meal, and J Balvin into a chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Xbox Fridge**: Xbox took the meme of its console looking like a fridge and made a real, functional fridge, sending it to influencers like Snoop Dogg and iJustine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This was purely for conversation and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **KFC's Wild Ventures**:
    *   **Dating Simulator**: KFC created a dating simulator game featuring a "heartthrob sexy Colonel Sanders," which the speaker found surprisingly engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
    *   **Gaming Console**: KFC also announced the development of its own gaming console, the KFConsole, which includes a "chicken chamber" to keep food warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## The Cycle of Attention and [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | Impact of Social Media Engagements]]

The speaker notes a continuous cycle: [[the_humanization and personification of brands | brands]] do something weird, people talk about it, brands make money, and the cycle continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. This leads to a situation where brands exist to make people talk about them, as their "content is like better than their product most of the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### Labor and Ethical Concerns
The individuals running these brand accounts are human beings whose jobs may be undervalued despite the creative content they produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Companies like GameStop reportedly pressure employees to create TikToks to drive store traffic, which the speaker views as "free labor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

The speaker concludes that by discussing these brand antics, they are playing into the brands' hands, becoming a "lightning rod for for thirsty brands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The strange incentives are highlighted by the speaker's own reliance on advertising income and even a personal interaction with a brand account that led to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. The entire phenomenon reflects how "brands can break your heart just like us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

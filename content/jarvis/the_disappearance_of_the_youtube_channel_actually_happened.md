On June 8th, a YouTube channel known as "Actually Happened" vanished "Without a Trace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This channel was known for animating stories that claimed to be "the internet's truest animated stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The disappearance prompted an investigation into what occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Nature of Actually Happened's Stories

The channel, which started two years prior to its disappearance, claimed to animate and feature professional voice actors telling "stories of children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, the [[the_fake_nature_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | fake nature of the YouTube channel Actually Happened]] was evident as many of its stories were "located in Reddit threads that are years old" and "almost verbatim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Over time, the channel's content shifted from plagiarized Reddit stories to "provably untrue stories" with "just enough detail to tell you that they're completely made up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. They also began incorporating "real life celebrities" such as Oprah Winfrey, Billie Eilish, and Jackie Chan, ostensibly telling first-person stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## The Disappearance and Evidence

The channel grew "for years and years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, its sudden vanishing led to speculation about its authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Upon investigation, it was found that the YouTube channel page for Actually Happened was still active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. However, all of its videos were gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. By using old links to their videos, it was discovered that they had been made private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Theories Behind the Vanishing

There are several [[theories_behind_the_vanishing_of_actually_happened | theories behind the vanishing of Actually Happened]], though none can be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>:

*   **YouTube Takedown**: This theory suggests that YouTube removed the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. However, this is unlikely because when YouTube takes down a channel, it typically displays a suspension notice, which was not present on the "Actually Happened" page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Self-Privatization/Deletion**: The videos were made private, meaning they were deliberately hidden, not deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Removing videos is permanent, so making them private is the alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The question then becomes *why* a channel with over 1.5 billion views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a> and potentially earning "upwards of four hundred thousand dollars a month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> (equating to around $5 million yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>) would suddenly cease its revenue stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Legal Battle**: One theory posits that a legal battle might have compelled them to privatize their videos to prevent further monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Given the channel's corporate nature, there has been no public statement regarding the disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Rebranding/Content Reuse**: "Actually Happened" is part of the Sole Publishing entity, which also owns "Five-Minute Crafts" and "Bright Side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. A screen recording from April confirmed "Actually Happened" was once listed among Sole Publishing's properties, but it has since been removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Sole Publishing is known for reusing content across its channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, leading to the theory that "Actually Happened" might be planning to "re-release itself under a new identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. However, making all videos private rather than simply deleting them for re-upload makes this less straightforward.

## The Proliferation of Similar Channels

The [[critique_of_actually_happened_youtube_channel | Critique of Actually Happened YouTube channel]] also extends to a broader issue. "Actually Happened" itself began as a copycat of "Storybooth," a legitimate channel where children narrate their own stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

The success of "Actually Happened" inspired a [[the_rise_of_similar_youtube_channels | proliferation of similar YouTube channels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It appears that combining words like "story," "animated," "happened," and "my" can generate names for numerous "fake animated story channels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, such as "Actually Happened Animate," "My Story Animated," and "My Crazy Story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

This [[proliferation_of_fake_animated_story_channels_on_youtube | Proliferation of fake animated story channels on YouTube]] often involves sensationalist content designed to "manipulate the emotions of children for views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. For example, "My Story Animated," founded by an Israeli app developer, has nearly as many subscribers as "Actually Happened" and features "far more objectionable content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, including titles like "I eat scorpions for breakfast to become poisonous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> and "Me and my BFF fell for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> with concerning thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Conclusion

The mystery surrounding the disappearance of "Actually Happened" remains unsolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. While the channel's departure is not mourned due to its problematic content and its contribution to the [[impact_of_fake_stories_on_youtube | Impact of fake stories on YouTube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, the prevalence of similar channels suggests a systemic issue that needs to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

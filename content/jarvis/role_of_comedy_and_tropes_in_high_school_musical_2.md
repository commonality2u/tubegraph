The video humorously praises [[High School Musical 2 plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]] as a "cinematic masterpiece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> and even the "greatest achievement in cinematic history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, comparing it ironically to films like *Citizen Kane* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This hyperbolic praise sets a comedic tone for the analysis, acknowledging the film's enjoyment despite its narrative quirks.

## Narrative Tropes and Inconsistencies

### Character Amnesia and "New Game Plus"
A key observation regarding the film's approach to [[Character development in High School Musical series | character development]] is the concept of "complete amnesia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a> from the first movie. Despite significant [[character_analysis_in_high_school_musical_the_musical_the_series | character arcs]] in the original, [[High School Musical 2 plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]] acts like a "new game plus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a> where "everything starts from scratch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>, with the cast remaining but their past growth ignored.

*   **Sharpay's Unresolved Conflict**: Even after her character arc in the first movie, Sharpay "still seems hell-bent on ruining Gabriella's life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>, comically highlighted by the line, "I thought we were all in this together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. Her antics are seen as "a little more messed up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a> in this film.
*   **Troy's Changing Priorities**: Troy's character is criticized for neglecting his girlfriend and friends to focus on his basketball future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>, and for rehearsing with Sharpay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>, even though he's "not in the most elegant of ways" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>.
*   **Gabriella's Diminished Role**: Gabriella's "freaky genius girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a> persona is removed, making her "kind of just an accessory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a> in [[High School Musical 2 plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>.

### Comedic Plot Holes and Running Gags

The film's comedic elements often stem from its narrative inconsistencies and recurring gags.

*   **The "What Time Is It" Scene**: The opening song sees students singing about summer starting, only for them to be back in school in the very next scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. This is pointed out as illogical, especially since Chad's shirt says "Majored in Summer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **Chad and Miss Darbus**: Chad kissing Miss Darbus during the opening song is a comedic, never-addressed moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **Troy's Narcissistic Gift**: Troy gives Gabriella a necklace with his initial "T" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>, which is humorously dubbed the "most narcissistic gift of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>, compared to a "dark mark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
*   **"Disney Channel Hates Moms"**: The recurring trope of mothers "killing the vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>, exemplified by Mrs. Bolton, leads to the humorous observation that the Disney Channel is "full of anti-mom propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
*   **Sharpay's "Fabulous" Spelling**: Sharpay misspells "Fabulous" on her car and locker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>, leading to a comedic demand for "autocorrect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.
*   **Sharpay's Pool Fall**: Sharpay stages a fall into a "very shallow pool where she is in absolutely no danger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>, leading to a comedic observation about Gabriella's stunt double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
*   **Kelsey's Magical Song Imbuement**: Kelsey, the in-universe composer, has a "magical ability to imbue Troy and Gabriella with her music and lyrics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>, allowing them to sing new songs without practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.
*   **The "And She Steps on the Ball" Gag**: The running gag where Mr. Evans tells a story that ends with "and she steps on the ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>, is explained by guest comedian Curtis Connor as a "classic cinematic misdirection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a> that's part of a larger, unseen "High School Musical Cinematic Universe (HSMCU)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a> where the punchline involves a character named "Thaboll" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>.
*   **Fulton's Relatability**: While often demonized, Fulton is portrayed as a relatable character "who doesn't want to lose his job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a> and is "taking orders from a child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>, making his villainy somewhat sympathetic.
*   **Sharpay's Titanic Comparison**: Sharpay dramatically compares her situation to the *Titanic* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>, an over-the-top comparison that is quickly dismissed as "not a similar situation at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>.
*   **The Final Talent Show**: The Wildcats win the talent show because their competition was "a woman with a puppet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:24:00">[32:24:00]</a>, a comedic trivialization of the competition.

### Visual and Production Design Humor

The video highlights several visual elements that contribute to the film's unintentional or intentional humor.

*   **Color Grading**: The film's "very blue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a> color grading makes "the blues are popping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>, and the greens in "Bet On It" are "extremely green" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a> to the point of looking "green screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>.
*   **Papyrus Font**: The "liberal use of the Papyrus font" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a> at Lava Springs is humorously noted as a "dangerous thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.
*   **Worst CGI Moment**: The infamous scene where Troy looks into a pond and sees a "world's worst CG" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a> reflection of himself is highlighted for its poor execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>, though later ironically called "perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>.
*   **Low Resolution Fireworks**: The fireworks show is noted for its "world's lowest resolution fireworks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:00">[31:54:00]</a>.

### Musical and Thematic Tropes

*   **Unaddressed "Redacted Song"**: The existence of a "redacted song" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a> that was thankfully not broadcast on television, but is present in the Disney+ version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>, is mentioned with disdain.
*   **"I Don't Dance" and Queer Subtext**: The song "I Don't Dance" is highlighted for its "sexual tension between Ryan and Chad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a> and its "hot as hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:16:00">[22:16:00]</a> choreography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>. The director, Kenny Ortega, who is gay, has discussed Ryan's character as being gay at a time when Disney Channel wasn't ready for such a conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>. The comedic and potentially symbolic moment of Chad and Ryan switching clothes after the song is also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.
*   **The "Sad Ballad" Trope**: The "sad ballad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a> where Gabriella leans against a locker is humorously applied to "Go My Own Way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>, with the observation that talking would be more efficient than singing a dramatic argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a>.
*   **"Bet On It"**: Troy's interpretive dance to "Bet On It" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54:00">[25:54:00]</a> is humorously revealed to be inspired by a "memo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a> about staff not being allowed to perform in the talent show. The scene's intense filming process (six days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a> and its vibrant, unnatural green landscape are also highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>.

Overall, [[High School Musical 2 plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]] is celebrated for its entertainment value, despite, or perhaps because of, its reliance on comedic tropes, narrative inconsistencies, and memorable, if sometimes absurd, musical numbers and visual choices.

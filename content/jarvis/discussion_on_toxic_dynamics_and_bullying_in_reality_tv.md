*The Bachelor* is often considered a "bad TV show," and its audience generally expects it to be so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, the season featuring Matt James managed to be uniquely disappointing, even by its own low standards, due to its explicit embrace of toxic dynamics and bullying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Bachelor's Unconventional Season
Historically, *The Bachelor* franchise follows a formula where a contestant from a previous season becomes the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This season, however, the producers disrupted this "natural order" by casting Matt James, an outsider who was fast-tracked to the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Matt James was nearly on Claire's season of *The Bachelorette*, but ultimately wasn't a contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. His selection as the first Black Bachelor was a significant announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Focus on Drama Over Connection
Every season of *The Bachelor* begins with introductions of its "kooky" cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. In this season, the show's producers chose to spend most of their time on "petty drama" rather than developing the characters of the contestants or their relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This approach highlights the [[dramatization_and_editing_in_reality_tv | dramatization and editing]] prevalent in reality TV.

### Instances of Toxic Behavior
*   **Verbal Abuse:** One contestant, Queen Victoria, was depicted as a villain who would call others derogatory names like "hoe" without reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Misuse of "Toxic":** The term "toxic" became a generalized insult for anything a contestant disliked, rather than describing genuinely harmful behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Targeting Vulnerable Contestants:** The show painted a girl as "needy and selfish," leading to her being ganged up on by others, only to reveal she was dealing with a terminal illness in her family and was unable to contact them due to show rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Her eventual departure was celebrated by the other contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, showcasing a disturbing lack of empathy and contributing to the [[negative_portrayal_of_models_and_contestants_in_reality_television | negative portrayal of models and contestants]].
*   **Baseless Accusations:** A significant drama involved contestant Anna baselessly claiming a new girl, Brittany, was an escort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This rumor, based on unverified direct messages, significantly damaged Brittany's reputation, making "escort" appear in search results for her name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This incident is a clear example of the [[examination_of_toxic_behavior_on_dating_shows | examination of toxic behavior on dating shows]] and the [[discussion_on_the_impact_of_media_on_contestants_lives | impact of media on contestants' lives]].

## Handling of Controversies
The season was further marred by controversy surrounding contestant Rachael Kirkconnell, who attended an antebellum-themed sorority party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This event, celebrating a period defined by slavery, was met with public outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

Chris Harrison, the show's host, attempted to defend Kirkconnell's actions in an interview with Rachel Lindsay, the first Black Bachelorette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Harrison's defense of the 2018 photo, suggesting it "wasn't a good look in 2021" but "wasn't the case in 2018," was widely criticized for minimizing the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

The fallout from this interview led to Rachel Lindsay being harassed off Instagram for calmly explaining why Harrison's logic was flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Both Matt James and Rachel Lindsay had to deactivate accounts or delete posts due to harassment, highlighting the severe [[discussion_on_the_impact_of_media_on_contestants_lives | impact of media on contestants' lives]] and the show's responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. The producers faced questions regarding their prior knowledge of Kirkconnell's questionable past, given that such castings are sometimes done for ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

## The Lead's Detachment and Its Impact
Matt James, as the Bachelor, was described as "inert" and "robotic" in his interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. His common response to declarations of love—"Thank you for sharing that with me"—was seen as highly impersonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. This lack of genuine engagement from the lead exacerbated the show's focus on external drama rather than authentic [[contestants_and_relationship_dynamics | relationship dynamics]].

## The Aftershow and Producer Responsibility
The season's "After The Final Rose" special was hosted by Emmanuel Acho, who discussed the pressures Matt faced as the first Black Bachelor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Matt ended his relationship with Rachael Kirkconnell because he didn't want to be the one to teach her about being Black in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. While Acho distinguished between "racist behavior" and "racially insensitive behavior," the commentary noted that such distinctions do not matter to the recipient of the behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

Ultimately, the show's production was heavily criticized. The producers were seen as "pulling strings" to create drama, putting contestants in "rough situations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. This season exemplified a [[critique_of_reality_tv_and_its_portrayal_of_relationships | critique of reality TV and its portrayal of relationships]] and highlighted [[critiques_on_reality_tv_show_formats_and_stereotypes | critiques on reality TV show formats and stereotypes]]. The overall sentiment was that "messing with people's lives for entertainment has gone too far" and doesn't even result in good television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

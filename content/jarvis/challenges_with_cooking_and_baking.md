Attempting to follow online cooking tutorials, particularly those from unconventional sources like Troom Troom, can present numerous [[challenges_faced_by_software_engineers | challenges]]. A specific [[gingerbread_recipe_attempt_and_outcome | gingerbread recipe attempt]] highlighted several difficulties encountered during the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Ingredient and Measurement Issues

One of the initial hurdles was accurately measuring ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Even with precise instructions, issues arose:
*   **Missing Ingredients** The final product suggested that the recipe might have forgotten key ingredients, such as molasses, which are typically found in other gingerbread recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.
*   **Ingredient Availability** Locating specific items like ground ginger within a grocery store proved challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Ingredient Substitution** The recipe called for white sugar, but brown sugar was the only type available in the kitchen, leading to uncertainty about whether this would ruin the recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Difficult to Dispense Ingredients** Honey was particularly challenging to get out of its bottle, requiring shaking and even microwaving to loosen it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Preparation Difficulties

Several steps in the preparation phase presented unexpected problems:
*   **Microwave Safety** Melting butter in a metal bowl raised concerns about microwave safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Dough Consistency and Handling** The dough became very thick, causing wrist pain during kneading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. It was also sticky, requiring assistance to remove from hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Chilling the dough was attempted but didn't resolve the stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **Lack of Tools** Without construction paper or a rolling pin, alternative methods were improvised, such as free-handing the gingerbread man shape and using a water bottle as a rolling pin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Workspace Concerns** Applying glaze directly on a couch, as depicted in a clickbait thumbnail, raised questions about the appropriateness of the workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Baking and Finishing Problems

The baking and decorating stages also had their share of difficulties:
*   **Oven Safety** An attempt was made to put wax paper in the oven, which is unsafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Baking Outcome** After 20 minutes, the gingerbread man's color was lighter than the raw dough, and its texture was very soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. It also had a "boil" on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Flipping Difficulty** Flipping the gingerbread man while still soft was hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Glaze Consistency** The prepared glaze was very runny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Product Quality** The gingerbread was described as tasting "horrible," like "cardboard," or something you'd build a house out of, with a burnt smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. It was later suggested that the dough was not kneaded long enough, resulting in a super dense product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

## Recreating the Thumbnail: Scaling Challenges

To achieve the "giant" gingerbread man from the [[following_a_troom_troom_cooking_tutorial | Troom Troom]] thumbnail, significant scaling [[challenges_and_dynamics_of_digital_marketing | challenges]] arose:
*   **Baking in Parts** Due to pan size limitations, the giant gingerbread man had to be baked in multiple parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Joining Parts** The major challenge became how to stick these baked parts together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Unconventional Adhesives** Melted gummy bears were used as "cement," which presented its own complications, including the bears having a "hard time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
*   **Environmental Factors** The heat from the lights used during filming caused the icing to melt, ruining the final appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Recipe Design Philosophy
> It was speculated that Troom Troom might not expect anyone to actually try their recipes, which could explain why the gingerbread recipe did not taste good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. The recipe prioritized structural soundness over taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

The overall [[public_reactions_to_unconventional_cooking_methods | public reactions to unconventional cooking methods]] and the final product were mixed; one friend described it as a "badly burned beach dolphin," and a roommate screamed upon seeing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. While the entertainment value of [[following_a_troom_troom_cooking_tutorial | following a Troom Troom cooking tutorial]] was present, the inability to produce an edible result was a disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

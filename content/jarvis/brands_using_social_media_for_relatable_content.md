The phenomenon of brands attempting to be "relatable" on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, has become widespread, extending beyond just food companies to "literally everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>. This strategy involves brands personifying themselves and engaging in conversations, often mimicking internet culture and humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

## Evolution of Relatable Brand Content

The practice of brands personifying themselves on social media dates back to the early days of platforms like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:17">[05:46:17]</a>.

### Early Days of Personification

Denny's Diner is often credited with popularizing the "brands being relatable thing" on Tumblr around 2013, characterized by memes and quirky posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:25">[05:22:25]</a>. However, brands were personifying themselves on Twitter even earlier, around 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:39">[05:34:39]</a>. For example, Wendy's nine years prior to the video's creation tweeted relatable content about drinking chocolate milk when a Frosty wasn't available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:30">[05:51:30]</a>. Early Twitter content focused on talking about daily activities, aligning with the platform's initial purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:15">[06:17:15]</a>. However, these early posts generally did not involve memes or "roasting" fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:04">[06:32:04]</a>.

### The Rise of [[corporate_humor_and_communication_on_social_media_platforms | Corporate Humor]] and Memes

Over time, [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brands]] began incorporating more aggressive humor, memes, and even "diss tracks" into their social media [[brands_as_people_marketing_strategy | marketing strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:37">[06:37:37]</a>.
Examples include:
*   **Wendy's** releasing a "cringey" mixtape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:37">[06:37:37]</a>.
*   **Chester Cheetah** (Cheetos mascot) creating a diss track about Doritos, despite both being owned by the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:19">[06:54:19]</a>.
*   A controversial, possibly fake, tweet from **Orville Redenbacher** offering toilet hygiene advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:43">[07:29:43]</a>.
*   **Sonic the Hedgehog**'s Twitter account posting relatable, fan-oriented content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:23">[07:50:23]</a>.
*   Even the **Twitter** platform's official account tweeting like a person and engaging in interviews with celebrities like Chrissy Teigen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:59">[08:24:59]</a>.

## The "Sunny D" Incident

A significant example of this trend is when the Sunny D Twitter account posted "I can't do this anymore" during the Super Bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:27">[03:44:27]</a>. This tweet was interpreted by many as a cry for help, causing a viral reaction across Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:58">[03:48:58]</a>. This incident led to other brands, like Pop-Tarts, Moonpie, Little Debbie, and DiGiorno, joining the conversation with similar "emo" or "mental health" themed posts, highlighting [[social_media_platforms_and_content_imitation | content imitation]] among brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:17">[03:59:17]</a>.

## Who is Behind the Brand Accounts?

It is a common misconception that these brand accounts are managed by "marketing executives in a boardroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:23">[09:24:23]</a>. In reality, they are run by "regular people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:47">[13:04:47]</a>. For instance, the person who ran Denny's social media during its rise to fame was 23-year-old Amber Gordon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:17">[13:30:17]</a>.

Managing a social media account for a brand can be a difficult job, often involving harassment directed at the individual manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:33">[13:47:33]</a>. These individuals are typically exercising "what little freedom they have and goofing around while trying to pay their rent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:05">[14:01:05]</a>.

## Why Do Brands Engage in Relatable Content?

The primary motivation for brands adopting this strategy is to increase sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:55">[14:06:55]</a>. Blogs and marketing articles often advise on using humor to build "brand personality" and appeal to consumers, suggesting that humor "tends to stand out" as a marketing message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:04">[10:55:04]</a>.

However, beyond sales, this strategy also appears to fill a pre-existing need or expectation from consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:03">[14:36:03]</a>. In cultures like America, there is already a strong tradition of celebrating brands, evident in sponsored events like the Super Bowl where commercials are eagerly anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:48">[14:40:48]</a>. This implies that consumers are, in a way, inviting brands to entertain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:03">[14:52:03]</a>.

## Critiques and Considerations

While brand tweets are often "obvious" with their blue checkmarks, leading to less concern than the spread of misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:14">[14:33:14]</a>, there are still criticisms:
*   **Cringey Content:** Many attempts at being relatable or humorous are perceived as "cringey" by internet users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:37">[06:37:37]</a>.
*   **Corporate Self-Awareness:** Some critics view post-ironic, self-aware brand content as "destroying the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:18">[01:30:18]</a>.
*   **Harassment of Managers:** The humanization of brands can lead to consumers directing harassment at the individuals managing the social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:25">[13:51:25]</a>.

[!WARNING]+ [[Impact of social media engagements by brands | Impact]]
While it's important to continue criticizing "weird advertising practices" by brands, it's also crucial to remember that there's often a person with limited power doing their job behind the screen, and criticism should be directed at the brand account, not the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:07">[14:09:07]</a>.

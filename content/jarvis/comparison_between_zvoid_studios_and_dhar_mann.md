ZVOID Studios is a YouTube channel that has been observed to "fully copy" the [[criticism_of_dhar_mann_videos | Dhar Mann]] content formula, yet, in some views, manages to execute it "better" than [[criticism_of_dhar_mann_videos | Dhar Mann]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The channel creates short movies focused on themes of life, business, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Similarities to Dhar Mann
ZVOID Studios videos are very easy to mistake for [[criticism_of_dhar_mann_videos | Dhar Mann]]'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. They utilize the same thumbnail style and text, designed to appear in YouTube's sidebar alongside [[criticism_of_dhar_mann_videos | Dhar Mann]] videos, making it difficult for viewers to discern the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Key Differences and Perceived Superiority
The primary distinction that makes ZVOID Studios videos "superior" to [[criticism_of_dhar_mann_videos | Dhar Mann]]'s is the consistent inclusion of superpowers for all characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While maintaining the moral-driven narratives characteristic of [[criticism_of_dhar_mann_videos | Dhar Mann]], ZVOID videos introduce magical elements, such as random individuals on park benches possessing mystical powers or child wizards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This infusion of fantasy sets ZVOID Studios apart by making the content less grounded in real-world traumas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
ZVOID Studios reportedly avoids some of the common pitfalls seen in [[criticism_of_dhar_mann_videos | Dhar Mann]]'s content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. Specifically, ZVOID videos do not include the direct, explicit moralizing statements at the end, such as "We're not just telling stories, we're changing lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The fantastical element of superpowers also prevents the stories from inadvertently playing on real-world traumas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

## Analysis of a ZVOID Studios Video: "Kid found out he can freeze time what happens next will shock you"
This particular video serves as an example of ZVOID Studios' unique approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Title and Premise
The title itself, "Kid found out he can freeze time what happens next will shock you," is noted for its contradictory nature, with the first half already being "shocking enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The story centers on a child whose parents are constantly arguing and are on the brink of divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The child, wishing for "superpowers" to "stop all this," gains the ability to freeze people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Production and Narrative Peculiarities
Several specific production and narrative choices in the video are highlighted:
*   **Accents**: The family members exhibit "wildly different accents," with the child being British, the mother vaguely Eastern European, and the father Southern American, creating a "United Nations household" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Audible Arguments**: The parents' arguments seem to be "piped into his room via loudspeaker," implying the "whole house is bugged" or the walls are "made of papers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Dialogue Oddities**: A brief scene where the father offers "mashed potatoes with a social like" leads to an extended query about the "sauce" mentioned instead of gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Divorce Announcement**: The parents awkwardly kneel on the floor to announce their divorce, described as resembling a joint marriage proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. The idea of hearing the news in a "loving environment" is sarcastically contrasted with hypothetical alternative scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Superpower Specifics**: The power is not time-freezing but specifically freezing *people* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Child's Reaction**: The child's initial reaction to freezing his parents is one of "emotional Whiplash," moving from "amazing" to "all powerful" despite the predicament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. He quickly focuses on playing a video game with a friend, showing a lack of immediate concern for his frozen parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Friend's Pragmatism**: The friend, Tiffany (or Sandra), is portrayed as pragmatic, quickly questioning who will sign school documents or provide hugs, highlighting the practical consequences of the frozen parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **Villain Origin Story**: The boy's actions, particularly freezing his friend, are characterized as a "villain origin story," as he smiles menacingly and dismisses his friend's concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   **Resolution**: The parents are unfrozen and explain to their son that their divorce does not diminish their love for him or their status as his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

Ultimately, the [[unique_elements_in_zvoid_studios_content | unique elements in ZVOID Studios content]], particularly the inclusion of superpowers, differentiate its execution of the "moral story" formula from [[criticism_of_dhar_mann_videos | Dhar Mann]]'s.

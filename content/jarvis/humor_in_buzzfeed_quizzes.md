[[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] are characterized by their often nonsensical and absurd nature, providing a source of humor and self-reflection for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The website itself is known for dealing "exclusively in trending topics," leading to a mix of "horrific" news and "oh my god, so cute" content, with quizzes conveniently placed alongside news as if of "equal importance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Evolution of Quiz Humor

Initially, [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] were described as "very pointless" but "straightforward," such as "what Harry Potter character are you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Over time, however, they evolved to become "really Weird and Specific" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This shift introduced a new layer of humor through their increasingly bizarre prompts and premises.

Early examples of self-discovery from quizzes included finding out one's mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, how many kids one would have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, or even one's "inner Lacroix flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Some quizzes even claimed to reveal a user's attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> or what kind of pirate they were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Absurdity in Prompts

Many contemporary [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] require users to perform "some sort of task" before revealing information they likely already know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. One example highlighted the imbalance of effort versus reward: "Shop at Victoria's Secret and we'll give you an Ariana Grande song to listen to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The humor arises from the disproportionate effort of shopping at a store with "so much variety" for just "ONE Ariana Grande song" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Other quizzes humorously challenge intelligence with exaggerated claims, such as "We bet you haven't tried at least half of the cheeses on this list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The implied challenge to a person's cheese knowledge is delivered with a satirical tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

A particularly humorous example involves a quiz titled "Plan a movie night and we'll guess your age with Frightening Accuracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The idea of being "frightened" by one's own age, especially when presented in the context of planning a casual movie night, adds to the comedic effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The questions within this quiz, like "Who's invited to movie night?" offering options such as "Sports team?" further underscore the quirky nature of the quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## The "Love Poo" Quiz: A Case Study in Toilet Humor

One quiz, "This yes or no quiz will tell us if you love poo," serves as a prime example of the extreme and often cringe-worthy humor found in [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The quiz is humorously critiqued for its unnecessary existence and excessive length, as it could arguably be answered with a single question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

The quiz delves into highly personal and often uncomfortable questions, such as:
*   "Do you ever feel genuinely happy when you have a big poo?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
*   "Do you ever look back at who you've just done and think wow?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>
*   "Do you often feel lighter when you go for a poo?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>
*   "Do you ever text or send selfies while you poo?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
*   "Do you ever announce that you're going for a shit in front of a group of people?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>

### Humorous Stock Photos

A significant part of the humor in the "Love Poo" quiz comes from its baffling selection of stock photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. These images depict people in unusual and often distressed scenarios while on the toilet, leading to questions about their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. For instance, an image titled "Smiling young man taking selfie with cell phone while defecating in his bathroom" exemplifies the specificity and absurdity of stock photography used to illustrate these quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The detailed keywords for such photos, including "shit," "bathroom," "poo," and "selfie," further emphasize the bizarre nature of the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Meta-Commentary on Quiz Authorship

The "Love Poo" quiz was written by "BuzzFeed staff," prompting a humorous discussion about the nature of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. It is suggested that such quizzes might be "an inside joke" or simply a result of the authors "having fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This meta-commentary highlights the lighthearted and often satirical approach to content creation within the platform.

Ultimately, while some [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] are simple and direct, many lean into the absurd, employing humor through outlandish premises, disproportionate tasks, and deliberately strange questions, often amplified by bizarre imagery.

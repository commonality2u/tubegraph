In 2020, Twitter experienced a significant hacking incident, described as "nearly the worst case scenario" for the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Scammers gained control of numerous highly influential Twitter accounts, including those belonging to world leaders, entertainers, brands, and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Bitcoin Scam
The hacked accounts posted a Bitcoin scam, promising to double any cryptocurrency sent to a specific address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The message, nearly identical across all compromised accounts, stated: "We've decided to give back to our community all bitcoins sent to our address will be sent back double if you send us point five BTC we will send you back one BTC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The scam relied on the untraceable, untrackable, and irreversible nature of Bitcoin transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Notable accounts affected included:
*   Barack Obama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Kanye West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>
*   Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   Mr. Beast, which was considered particularly believable due to his philanthropic tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Exercise fantasy Owen, a deceased individual, making the scam highly unbelievable for that account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>

## Impact and Losses
Approximately 400 people fell victim to the scam, losing over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Bitcoin transaction records, which are public, showed thousands of dollars being sent to the scam address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. While the financial loss was significant for individuals, it could have been much worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. An attacker with the ability to tweet from any account could have caused substantial damage to stock markets by manipulating public perception, such as tweeting a false resignation from a major company CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Twitter, as a company, could afford to repay the scammed individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Twitter's Response
During the incident, Twitter initially disabled the affected accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Subsequently, it prevented all verified accounts from tweeting, which temporarily silenced many users, including the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Twitter also reportedly suspended users who tweeted screenshots of the internal tool used by the hackers, suggesting an effort to manage [[public_perceptions_and_reactions_to_social_media_platform_vulnerabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Root Cause: [[the_use_of_social_engineering_in_cybersecurity_breaches | Social Engineering]]
Early reports indicated that [[the_use_of_social_engineering_in_cybersecurity_breaches | social engineering]] was at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This means an insider at Twitter was either tricked or paid off to facilitate the hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The attackers gained access to Twitter's internal tools, which support staff typically use to manage and troubleshoot accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This access needs to be "locked down" and handled with extreme care and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Twitter's Historical Vulnerabilities
This incident highlighted what some see as a recurring pattern of security weaknesses at Twitter.
*   **Donald Trump's Account:** Two years prior to this hack, a Twitter support staff member deleted Donald Trump's account as an act of protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Following this, Twitter implemented extra safeguards for his account, which is why it was unaffected in the Bitcoin scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Critics questioned why similar protections were not extended to other influential accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Saudi Government Espionage:** Twitter had also faced issues where employees were allegedly paid off to steal company secrets and report them to the Saudi government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Lack of Investment in Security:** Despite being a public company established for over a decade with a platform that has "barely changed" in ten years, Twitter is criticized for not investing enough in security and user protection infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This contrasts with smaller companies that might lack resources, but is seen as unacceptable for a company of Twitter's maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The fact that the CEO also manages another company is cited as a potential reason for insufficient focus on Twitter's security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Lessons and Recommendations
The incident serves as a significant learning opportunity for both users and the company.
*   **User Caution:** A key takeaway for users is that "if something seems too good to be true, it is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, a principle that can prevent falling victim to [[identity_theft_and_social_media_issues | scams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Corporate Responsibility:** Twitter is urged to:
    *   **Invest in internal tools:** Ensure proper security measures for internal administrative tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
    *   **Protect support employees:** Implement better safeguards for support staff, who are often targets for scams to gain access to accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    *   **Consistent Security Testing:** Implement regular internal tests for phishing attempts and educate employees about cybersecurity risks, a practice common in other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

The incident underscores the [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | critical importance]] of robust cybersecurity for social media platforms, especially given their influence on public discourse and potential for [[social_media_outrage_culture_and_its_monetization | widespread outrage]] when vulnerabilities are exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

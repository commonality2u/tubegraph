Collectibles Guru, also known as the "Crypto King" from the crypto community, played a central role in a high-profile incident involving fake Pokémon cards that gained significant attention in the collecting community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. He was the seller of a first edition Pokémon card box to a YouTube channel named "Dumb Money," which turned out to be resealed with modern cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>.

## Background and Initial Interactions

Collectibles Guru's origin is in the crypto community, where he is known as the "Crypto King" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. He gained prominence in the Pokémon card market through his interactions with [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]], to whom he sold legitimate graded cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. However, there were early signs that raised questions about his credibility within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### Questionable Credibility
*   **Drug Deal Reference**: Upon first meeting [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]] in a video, Collectibles Guru referenced a drug deal, stating, "This feels like I'm trafficking a kilo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. This immediately gave people pause regarding his credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Bulbasaur Valuation**: He became a meme in the Pokémon community for claiming that a Bulbasaur card, typically valued at $3,000-$4,000 for a PSA 10, was worth $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. He doubled down on this valuation multiple times when [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]] questioned it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.
*   **Social Media Demeanor**: The narrator observed that Collectibles Guru "seems very not nice" on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

## [[the_incident_involving_dumb_money_and_fake_pokemon_cards | The "Dumb Money" Incident]]

Collectibles Guru sold a "world's most expensive" first edition base set box of Pokémon cards, supposedly for $375,000, to the "Dumb Money" YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. This transaction was streamed live on YouTube, attracting significant attention and [[community_backlash_and_the_role_of_audience_education | community backlash]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

### Pre-Sale Behavior and Justifications
Leading up to the box opening, Collectibles Guru offered several explanations for the box's condition and authenticity:
*   **Backstory of the Box**: He claimed the owner bought three boxes as a child, and they were stored in a gun safe the entire time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. This backstory was later contradicted by himself and the contents of the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>.
*   **Explaining Wear and Tear**: Guru explained why the box appeared to have been opened or resealed, claiming that it was due to normal wear, display practices (folding the top for store display), or pressure from being stacked for 20 years in a gun safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>. He offered a "100% money back" guarantee if it was fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>.
*   **"Delaying the Inevitable"**: His extensive talking about the box's authenticity and past tense statements like "it all seemed legit" were perceived as attempts to delay the opening and distance himself from responsibility if the box was fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>.

### Community Perception During the Stream
The live chat during the stream was overwhelmingly suspicious of Collectibles Guru, frequently calling him a "scammer" and predicting the box would be fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. Comments suggested he was a "crypto scammer who's moved to Pokemon to hyperinflate prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. Even a persistent on-screen comment stated, "why are you guys even in the same room as these scammers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.

### The Reveal
Upon opening, the box was found to contain not only non-first edition packs but also modern cards from 2020, indicating it had been resealed very recently, contradicting Guru's claim that any resealing would have occurred 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>.

After the revelation, Collectibles Guru was immediately on the phone with the alleged original seller within seconds, which raised suspicions about his preparedness for the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. He adopted a "Shaggy defense," claiming, "it wasn't me," implying he was also duped by the original seller, contradicting his earlier claims of knowing the chain of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>.

## Aftermath and Lingering Suspicions

While the "Dumb Money" investors were able to secure a refund and eventually acquire a legitimate box (though not from Guru directly), the incident left significant questions about Collectibles Guru's true role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:00">[23:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:14:00">[25:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:00">[25:16:00]</a>.

Collectibles Guru's narrative throughout the stream was seen as convenient and seemed to unravel as the situation unfolded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. His willingness to offer a refund and his surprise at the experts and live opening were noted as potentially strategic actions to protect his reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.

> [24:00:00] "It's just suspicious that everyone in the Pokemon Community seems to think Guru is a scammer."

Despite the official resolution, the broader Pokémon community continues to view Collectibles Guru with skepticism, with few vouching for his trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">[24:31:00]</a>. While he sold legitimate product to [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]], this is considered part of a potential long-term plan given [[the_impact_of_logan_paul_on_the_pokemon_card_market | Logan Paul's influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:39:00">[24:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>. The incident remains a notable example of the risks and complexities involved in [[scamming_in_highvalue_pokemon_card_transactions | high-value Pokémon card transactions]].

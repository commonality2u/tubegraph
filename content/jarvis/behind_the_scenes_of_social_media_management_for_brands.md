The [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | role of brands in social media]] has evolved significantly, with many companies attempting to cultivate a relatable and humorous presence online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This shift raises questions about who is actually behind these accounts and their motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The Evolution of Brand Personification on Social Media

While some believe that Denny's pioneered the trend of [[corporate_humor_and_communication_on_social_media_platforms | brands being relatable]] through memes on Tumblr around 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, brands have been personifying themselves since the early days of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. For example, Wendy's posted relatable content nine years ago, discussing chocolate milk as a frosty substitute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Early on, Twitter was a platform for sharing daily activities, leading brands to adopt a personal tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. However, the current trend of brands creating memes and engaging in "roasting" behavior is a more recent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Corporate Humor and Relatable Content

Many brands now aim to be "relatable" online, moving beyond traditional advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This often involves adopting trending content and internet humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Elon Musk** engaging in "thirst tweets" with the planet Mars' Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Sunny D** tweeting "I can't do this anymore" during the Super Bowl, which was widely interpreted as a cry for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This led other brands like Pop-Tarts and MoonPie to respond in character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Little Debbie** and **DiGiorno** tweeting about mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Chester Cheetah** (Cheetos mascot) creating a diss track about Doritos, despite both being owned by the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   A supposedly real, yet deleted, tweet from **Orville Redenbacher** giving advice on toilet wiping and showering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   The official **Sonic the Hedgehog** Twitter account and even the official **Twitter** account itself tweeting like people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Arby's** Twitter account making anime food art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

Many marketing blogs discuss how to use humor to build brand personality, often suggesting "clever language," "pop-culture references," and "meme jacking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. However, these attempts can sometimes be cringeworthy and out-of-touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## Who's Behind the Accounts?

Contrary to the common assumption that [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | brands on Twitter]] are run by "marketing executives in a boardroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, these accounts are typically managed by "regular-ass people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

*   The person behind the "woke" Steak-umm Twitter account is just a guy named Nathan who has a podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   Amber Gordon, then 23, was responsible for Denny's social media rise to fame on Tumblr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

These individuals often value their work and the relationships they create, even while also serving a bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Managing a social media account can be a difficult job, with individuals even facing harassment on their personal accounts for brand-related content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. It's often not a high-paying job with good benefits, but rather a role where people exercise "what little freedom they have and goofing around while trying to pay their rent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## Consumer Behavior and Critique

While brands use social media to increase sales through "shitposts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, consumers have also embraced this dynamic. There's a culture in America around celebrating brands, exemplified by the Super Bowl, which is sponsored and even celebrates its commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Consumers often "invite these brands to entertain us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

It's important to continue to criticize brands for unusual advertising practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, but the humanization of a brand should not prevent criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. However, criticism should be directed at the brand account itself, rather than harassing the individuals performing the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Brands on Twitter are often easily identifiable by their blue checkmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

Ultimately, the phenomenon of [[corporate_humor_and_communication_on_social_media_platforms | corporate humor and communication on social media platforms]] reflects a need that already existed between consumers and brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

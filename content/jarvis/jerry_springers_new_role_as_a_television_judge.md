After his long-running talk show concluded, [[jerry_springer_and_his_talk_show_controversies | Jerry Springer]] transitioned into a new television role as a judge on the show *Judge Jerry* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. This new program focuses on adjudicating small claims cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.

## Background and Qualifications
*The Jerry Springer Show* ended in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Despite the controversial nature of his previous show, [[jerry_springer_and_his_talk_show_controversies | Jerry Springer]] has a background that, according to the show's premise, qualifies him to be a judge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. He was once a lawyer and even served as the mayor of Cincinnati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

## *Judge Jerry* Format and Cases
The show features a variety of cases, some of which maintain the controversial and dramatic style reminiscent of his previous talk show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Examples of cases include:
*   Claims of marrying a first cousin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.
*   Accusations like "my ex sleeps with my son" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.
*   Disputes over familial relationships, such as "you're not my real grandma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

### Case Example: "She's a Thick White Girl"
One specific case highlighted involves a plaintiff named Adam Davis, an Instagram influencer from Dallas, Texas, who claims his former "friends with benefits" partner stole his identity after he ended their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.
*   **The Plaintiff's Story**: Adam Davis, who boasts 23,000 Instagram followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>, describes his occupation as getting paid to take pictures in people's clothes and post their pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. He met the defendant, Ashton, in 2018 on Instagram, describing her as "a thick white girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. After transitioning from friends to "friends with benefits," Adam claims he stopped talking to her after she became jealous of his interactions with other girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. This led to fake accounts of him appearing on Instagram, Tinder, and Facebook, using his picture but different names, to solicit money for shoots and not show up, harming his reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.
*   **Springer's Commentary and Humor**: [[jerry_springer_and_his_talk_show_controversies | Jerry Springer]] interjects with jokes, often playing on his age and a supposed lack of understanding of modern terms like "influencer" or "friends with benefits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. He also uses humor to comment on the plaintiff's behavior, such as Adam's definition of "friends with benefits" or his statement that "all women have roles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>.
*   **The Verdict**: The evidence presented largely consists of printouts of text messages or profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>. Despite the flimsy nature of the evidence, [[jerry_springer_and_his_talk_show_controversies | Jerry Springer]] finds for the plaintiff based on the defendant's alleged admission and a perceived lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.

## Overall Observations
The move to *Judge Jerry* indicates a continued presence in the entertainment industry for [[jerry_springer_and_his_talk_show_controversies | Jerry Springer]], albeit in a different format. While purporting to adjudicate real cases, the show retains elements of the sensationalism and manufactured drama that characterized *The Jerry Springer Show* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. [[jerry_springer_and_his_talk_show_controversies | Jerry Springer]] himself has defensively argued that his past show merely reflected how people really are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>, but critics argue that his shows exploit "irregular people" for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

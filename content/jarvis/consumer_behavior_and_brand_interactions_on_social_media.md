The landscape of social media has seen a peculiar shift in how [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brands]] interact with consumers and each other, particularly on platforms like Twitter. Many [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brands]] strive to appear "hip and with-it" to appeal to younger audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. This often results in humorous but sometimes "very, very weird" interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

## Wendy's: The Pioneer of "Roasting" Culture
Wendy's is widely recognized as a major player in this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>. Their viral tweet in 2017, stating "Our beef is way too cool to ever be frozen," sparked a famous exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. When a user challenged this, Wendy's engaged in a "roast," leading to widespread media attention and articles celebrating their "clap back tweets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">[02:22:01]</a>.

While initially seen as harmless and funny, the phenomenon of a multi-million dollar corporation "dunking on a regular ass person" has a strange aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:01">[02:36:01]</a>. Many tweets that Wendy's replied to were later deleted, which can make the [[corporate_humor_and_communication_on_social_media_platforms | brand]] appear to be harassing individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:01">[03:00:01]</a>. Despite this, thousands of people actively seek to be "roasted" by Wendy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:01">[03:20:01]</a>.

Wendy's has since achieved meme status, planning content around viral trends like "surgery on a grape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:01">[03:33:01]</a>. They even streamed Fortnite on Twitch, destroying in-game freezers to reinforce their "no frozen beef" slogan, and released a mixtape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:01">[03:38:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:01">[03:44:01]</a>.

> "She's not our friend. She's this guy and his 12,000 employees. What if Wendy's a sociopath and she's just doing all this to get us to like her so that we'll buy more of her weird and square hamburgers?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:01">[04:08:01]</a>

## The Widespread Adoption of Social Media Personas
Following Wendy's success, many other [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brands]] have adopted similar, often "dystopian" strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:01">[04:29:01]</a>.

### Burger King
Burger King also engages in "destroying their customers" on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:01">[04:45:01]</a>. For instance, in response to a customer complaining about missing cheese on a cheeseburger, Burger King retorted:
> "Pro tip: If you want cheese on your Whopper, use your words at the counter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:01">[05:05:01]</a>.
Burger King also uses Kardashian memes awkwardly and tweets "absolute gibberish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:01">[05:18:01]</a>. They have engaged in one-sided "beefs" with McDonald's, such as a [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing campaign]] offering free Whoppers if ordered through their app at a McDonald's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:01">[06:36:01]</a>.

### Inter-Brand "Drama"
A common tactic is for [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brands]] to interact with each other in replies, as if they are "at the same school lunch table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:01">[05:27:01]</a>. This often involves inventing "drama" to attract attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:01">[05:43:01]</a>. An example is the "epic rap battle" between Wendy's and Wingstop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:01">[05:56:01]</a>.

### Products Adopting Relatable Identities
Beyond fast food, individual products and snacks have adopted relatable personas on social media:
*   **Pop-Tarts** adopts the persona of "the friend with relationship problems," tweeting in the first person about exes and fear of intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:01">[07:31:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:01">[08:08:01]</a>.
*   **Hot Pockets** portrays itself as a "stoner cousin," with tweets like "Hot Pockets without hot are just pockets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:01">[08:13:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:01">[08:37:01]</a>.
*   **MoonPies**, a 100-year-old snack, unexpectedly acts as a "certified memelord," engaging in flirty exchanges with Wendy's and roasting fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:01">[09:00:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:01">[09:11:01]</a>.

### Steak-umm: The Meta-Commentary on Brand Twitter
Steak-umm, an obscure frozen beef product, has garnered over 45,000 followers by being the "most woke Twitter" account, offering meta-commentary on the nature of [[corporate_humor_and_communication_on_social_media_platforms | brand Twitter]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:01">[10:14:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:01">[11:17:01]</a>. They openly challenge other [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brands]] and self-deprecatingly critique [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | brand behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:01">[11:04:01]</a>. Their tweets are rarely about their actual product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:01">[11:50:01]</a>.

## Why Young People Flock to Brands on Social Media
The rise of this [[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | brand behavior]] raises questions about why young people, particularly Millennials, seek "love, guidance, and attention" from [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brands]] on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:01">[12:15:01]</a>. This phenomenon is potentially linked to:
*   Feelings of isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:01">[12:22:01]</a>
*   Dissatisfaction with service jobs and financial struggles, including student debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:01">[12:24:01]</a>
*   Growing up with internet culture, where their childhood is now being "resold" to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:01">[12:28:01]</a>
*   Access to information and social media, yet feeling more alone and insecure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:01">[12:35:01]</a>

As a result, they gravitate towards memes, absurdist humor, and even frozen meat companies on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:01">[12:38:01]</a>. This indicates that [[brands_using_social_media_for_relatable_content | brands using social media for relatable content]] are effectively tapping into a societal void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:01">[12:58:01]</a>.

## Effectiveness and Potential Downsides
This [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing strategy]] seems to be working. Wendy's, for example, has grown its Twitter following to nearly 3 million, and its business appears to be thriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:01">[13:05:01]</a>. This trend suggests that if ads are inevitable, they might as well be entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:01">[13:17:01]</a>.

However, this type of [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing]] can be harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:01">[13:21:01]</a>. Companies could potentially engage in "shady" practices and hide behind their cartoon mascots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:01">[13:24:01]</a>. For instance, while Wendy's boasts about "fresh never frozen beef," some critics point out their use of "slave labor potatoes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:01">[13:36:01]</a>.

Despite these concerns, the effectiveness of this approach is evident in successful [[behind_the_scenes_of_social_media_management_for_brands | brand partnerships]] that support creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:01">[13:48:01]</a>. The [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | impact of social media engagements by brands]] is deeply ingrained in modern society, much like how diamond engagement rings became a cultural norm due to a 1930s advertising campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:01">[14:14:01]</a>. Ultimately, while strange, these [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brand]] tweets might be the least of societal worries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:01">[14:27:01]</a>.

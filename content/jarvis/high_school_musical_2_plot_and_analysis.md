The 2007 Disney Channel Original Movie, *High School Musical 2*, is regarded as a cinematic masterpiece that improved significantly upon its predecessor, *High School Musical*, to the extent that *High School Musical 3* was released in theaters [03:20:00]. The speaker declares *High School Musical 2* to be "the greatest achievement in cinematic history" [03:48:00].

## Plot Summary

### Recap of the First Movie
The plot of [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical One]] does not directly influence the events of *High School Musical 2* [04:00:00]. However, for context, the first film introduces Troy Bolton, captain of the East High Wildcats basketball team and a school leader [04:04:00]. His life changes with the arrival of "freaky genius girl" Gabriella Montez [04:11:00]. Troy is inspired to challenge expectations by pursuing both basketball and singing [04:17:00]. Initially, his father and best friend Chad Danforth are unsupportive, but they eventually embrace his musical aspirations [04:23:00]. Meanwhile, Gabriella befriends academic students, wins the academic decathlon, and secures a role in the spring musical, proving that smart kids can also sing [04:41:00].

The pair face opposition from the "evil twins" Ryan and Sharpay Evans, who attempt to thwart Gabriella by enrolling her in clubs [04:51:00]. By the end of the first film, Ryan and Sharpay join the team, and everyone sings "We're All in This Together" [05:07:00].

### Amnesia and the Second Installment
Despite the [[character_development_in_high_school_musical_series | character development]] in the first movie, none of it seems present in *High School Musical 2* [05:14:00]. The characters appear to have "complete amnesia" regarding their previous arcs [05:28:00].

The film opens with the East High students in Ms. Darbus's class, anticipating summer [05:33:00]. They break into a song about summer's arrival and their plans [06:00:00]. Despite singing about school being out, they strangely remain on campus and dance [06:16:00]. In one instance, Chad Danforth kisses Ms. Darbus, a moment never addressed again [07:07:00]. The very next scene shows them back in school [06:54:00]. Troy gives Gabriella a necklace with a "T" on it [07:30:00].

The main characters are all seeking summer jobs to save for college or a car [07:51:00]. Troy receives a mysterious job offer from Thomas Fulton, the general manager of Lava Springs Country Club [08:22:00]. Lava Springs is a resort owned by Sharpay's family, featuring a pool and a golf course [09:13:00]. The speaker notes the club uses the "Papyrus font" heavily [09:31:00].

### Conflict at Lava Springs
Sharpay sees Troy arrive at Lava Springs with nearly the entire East High student body, who have also been hired [10:49:00]. Initially pleased, Sharpay becomes threatened when she sees Gabriella also working there [11:00:00]. She stages a fall into a shallow pool, prompting Gabriella's "stunt double" to rescue her [11:12:00]. Despite her [[character_development_in_high_school_musical_series | character arc]] in the first movie, Sharpay remains "hell-bent on ruining Gabriella's life" [11:43:00]. She enlists Fulton, who works for her parents, to make the Wildcats' summer job miserable and force them to quit [11:57:00].

Troy attempts to motivate his friends by singing "Work This Out" [12:40:00]. The song features impressive [[musical_numbers_and_choreography_in_high_school_musical_2 | choreography]] and the use of non-traditional instruments [12:54:00]. Chad, despite his previous aversion to theater, is seen dancing extensively in this number [13:01:00]. After avoiding work, Troy and Gabriella have a picnic in an open field, which Sharpay observes and interrupts with sprinklers [13:20:00].

They then encounter Kelsey, the in-universe composer, who has written a new song for them, "The Music in Me" [14:06:00]. Kelsey possesses a "magical ability" to instantly imbue Troy and Gabriella with her music, allowing them to sing and harmonize without rehearsal [14:14:00]. With renewed positive attitudes, Troy and Gabriella sign up for the resort's talent show [15:20:00].

### Troy's Dilemma and Relationships
The central conflict of the movie revolves around Troy's changing priorities, as he considers his future and a basketball scholarship over his high school girlfriend and friends [16:14:00]. Sharpay leverages her connections to get Troy in front of University of Albuquerque Redhawks scouts [15:52:00]. The University of Albuquerque and its Redhawks team are fictional [16:03:00].

Troy's increasing focus on his scholarship leads him to rehearse with Sharpay, neglecting Gabriella [16:51:00]. Gabriella confronts Troy about his new personality, but he prioritizes his new basketball connections [17:10:00]. Troy seeks advice from his father, who, characterized as a "human basketball," can only offer basketball-related wisdom [17:39:00].

Ryan, Sharpay's brother, becomes a key character in the latter half of the film [21:39:00]. Gabriella invites Ryan to play baseball with the Wildcats, leading to the iconic song "I Don't Dance" [21:49:00]. This song, featuring Chad and Ryan singing about not dancing while performing elaborate [[musical_numbers_and_choreography_in_high_school_musical_2 | choreography]], is noted for its "sexual tension" [21:58:00]. Director Kenny Ortega has discussed Ryan's character as being gay, but during a time when Disney Channel wasn't ready to depict it explicitly [22:06:00]. After the song, Chad and Ryan switch clothes, and Ryan essentially "defects" to the Wildcats, becoming the "new Troy" and even flirting with Gabriella, making Troy jealous [22:31:00].

Sharpay forces Troy to perform with her at the talent show and then manipulates Fulton to create a rule prohibiting staff members from performing [23:12:00]. Meanwhile, in Fulton's office, a poster for a fictional film "An Onion for Papa" is visible [23:40:00]. Fulton is portrayed as a sympathetic character, a man just trying to keep his job while taking orders from a child [24:02:00].

### The Climax and Resolution
Gabriella sings "Go My Own Way" to Troy, expressing her need to leave the resort and their relationship, returning the "T" necklace he gave her [24:34:00]. The song involves a "singing argument" between them [24:46:00]. After Gabriella leaves, Troy receives the memo about staff not being allowed to perform in the talent show [26:04:00]. This triggers his famous solo performance of "Bet On It," where he interpretive dances through the golf course at Lava Springs [25:57:00]. The scene took six days to film [26:41:00] and is noted for its extremely vibrant, almost "green screen" level green grass [26:52:00] and "world's worst CGI" during a reflection shot [27:31:00]. This song has become the most memed moment from the film [25:44:00], contributing to the [[impact_of_high_school_musical_2_on_pop_culture | cultural impact of High School Musical 2]].

At the talent show, Troy confronts Sharpay and walks out on their performance [28:34:00]. Ryan also drops out of performing with Sharpay, telling her she's "always wanted the spotlight" [28:49:00]. Troy reconciles with Chad and his friends, focusing on what truly matters [29:05:00]. Zeke, a supportive Wildcat, reassures Troy that "show business" isn't their whole lives [29:26:00]. Ryan then convinces Troy to talk to Sharpay, who is distraught [29:53:00]. Troy agrees to perform if the other Wildcats can also participate [30:17:00].

Just before the performance, Ryan tells Troy to learn a new song, revealing it's for Gabriella, who inexplicably returns to sing "Everyday" with Troy [30:29:00]. The conflict between them is resolved without direct conversation [31:00:00]. During this song, Troy wears a white suit, glowing like a "Boyz II Men video" [31:38:00]. The rest of the Wildcats eventually join the performance [31:34:00].

The movie concludes with a fireworks show and Troy and Gabriella sharing their first kiss [31:51:00]. The Wildcats win the talent show, beating a performer with a puppet [32:22:00]. Miley Cyrus makes a two-second cameo, a result of a Disney Channel stars poll [32:28:00].

## Analysis and Observations

*   **[[role_of_comedy_and_tropes_in_high_school_musical_2 | Character Regression]]**: The speaker notes that despite [[character_development_in_high_school_musical_series | character development]] in the first film, *High School Musical 2* seems to reset character arcs, particularly for Sharpay and Troy [05:14:00].

*   **[[role_of_comedy_and_tropes_in_high_school_musical_2 | Tropes and Running Gags]]**:
    *   The "T" necklace gift is described as "narcissistic" but also noted as a "Chekhov's T" when Gabriella returns it later [07:49:00].

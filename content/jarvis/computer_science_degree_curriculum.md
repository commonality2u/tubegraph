This article explores the typical curriculum of a Computer Science (CS) degree by reviewing an actual college transcript from Georgia Tech in Atlanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It aims to shed light on what big tech companies look for and what subjects are covered in a CS program, addressing questions about paths into [[software_engineering | software engineering]], programming, or CS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Freshman Year (Fall 2010)

The first semester of college for a CS student often involves foundational courses:

*   **CS 30.1 Intro to Computing** This course taught programming using [[introduction_to_programming_and_python | Python]] with robots called Scribblers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. A final project involved creating a script to scrape lyrics from online websites, demonstrating an [[application_of_programming_in_everyday_tasks | application of programming in everyday tasks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This course is similar to [[introduction_to_programming_for_beginners | Introduction to Programming for Beginners]].
*   **Calculus One** An initial attempt at this course was met with a professor who did not use a microphone or overhead projector, leading to a change of professors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Freshman Leap Seminar** This seminar served as an introduction to a career as a CS student, including activities like resume building and attending career fairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Chemistry One** As a required lab science, this course proved challenging, resulting in a low grade that impacted scholarship eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Freshman Year (Spring 2011)

The second semester built upon introductory concepts:

*   **Constructing Proofs** This was a discrete mathematics class, focusing on mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Intro to Object-Oriented Programming** Effectively an introduction to Java, this course focused on [[understanding_programming_concepts_variables_classes_functions | object-oriented programming concepts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The speaker later became a Teaching Assistant for this course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **English Two** The speaker's class focused on cyberpunk literature, reading works like "Neuromancer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Japanese One** A demanding language course with a strict professor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Calculus Two** Known for its difficulty, with professors sometimes referred to as "the four horsemen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Sophomore Year (Summer 2011)

This summer saw a heavy load of CS classes, driven by anxiety about securing a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>:

*   **Data Structures and Algorithms** This is a critical course, as it is the primary source of questions for technical interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Computer Organization and Programming** This class explained how computers function, progressing from digital logic to assembly language and ultimately to C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Projects included creating games for the Game Boy Advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Intro to Database Systems** A course dedicated to databases, covering data modeling and structuring for efficient storage and retrieval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Social Psychology** Described as a favorite class, the speaker might have studied psychology if it weren't for the extensive reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Sophomore Year (Fall 2011)

This semester continued with core CS subjects and general education requirements:

*   **Systems and Networks** Focused on low-level programming concepts, such as building a simple processor from logic gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Objects in Design** This course covered design patternsâ€”methods to structure and organize code for large applications or collaborative projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The speaker initially underestimated its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Teaching Assistantship** Served as an easy credit to boost GPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Spanish** A switch from Japanese, chosen due to prior high school experience and the need to maintain GPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Calculus Three** The speaker attempted this class twice, dropping it both times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Sophomore Year (Spring 2012)

The speaker continued to prioritize CS classes, even taking a senior-level course as a sophomore:

*   **Computer Networking** Explored how computers communicate with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** A more advanced [[data_structures_and_algorithms | algorithms]] course, dealing with problems that still lack fast solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Intro to Artificial Intelligence** Covered how to teach computers to perform various tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Senior Design** A web application project where the speaker contributed minimally due to focusing on other classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Spanish** Continuation of the language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Calculus Three** Dropped for the third time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Junior Year (Fall 2012)

After an internship at Google, the speaker returned with renewed motivation:

*   **Circa C++** An elective C++ class that was not required for the degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Science** A psychology class focusing on the brain and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*   **Machine Learning** Covered how computers learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Graded on an intense curve, where a 64/120 on the first exam was an A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Intro Physics**

## Senior Year (Fall 2013)

With a full-time offer from Yelp secured after an internship, the speaker focused on completing non-CS requirements:

*   **Health** A class on healthy living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Computer Vision** Taught how computers "see," with a final project involving tracking Mitt Romney's face in debate footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Statistics and Applications** A probability and statistics class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Physics Two** The second part of a two-semester lab science sequence required for graduation, chosen to avoid chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Senior Year (Summer 2014)

The speaker intentionally left one class for a study abroad experience in Barcelona:

*   **Architecture Class** Focused on the development of the city of Barcelona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Computational Photography** Covered how Photoshop works and even touched on Snapchat filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Computing Ethics** The final required class, discussing topics like liability in self-driving car accidents and patent law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. The speaker emphasized the importance of ethics classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

While every individual's educational journey is unique, this detailed review of a Computer Science degree curriculum provides insight into the breadth and depth of topics covered, from foundational programming and mathematics to advanced algorithms, machine learning, and ethical considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

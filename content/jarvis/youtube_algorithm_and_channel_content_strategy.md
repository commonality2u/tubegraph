The process of [[youtube_content_and_video_production | content creation]] on YouTube can be significantly influenced by the [[youtube_algorithm_and_notifications | YouTube algorithm]] and audience expectations, leading creators to struggle with their online identity and channel direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This dynamic often results in a push and pull between a creator's artistic growth and their audience's desire for consistent content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Creator Identity and Audience Expectations

Many creators face a challenge in defining their online identity, with viewers often categorizing them rigidly, such as a "big YouTuber" whose old content was preferred, or a "small YouTuber" perceived as jealous of larger channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Once a creator gains a following, they frequently receive comments and messages from long-time viewers urging them to revert to their original content or accusing them of not being "true to myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This phenomenon appears to be a common experience for creators as their channels grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

A vocal minority of viewers may feel entitled to the free content provided by creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. While a personal connection with content can lead to a sense of ownership, creators do not owe their audience anything beyond the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This expectation can manifest in extreme ways, such as fans arriving at a creator's private residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> or engaging in online bullying of celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### The Parasocial Relationship

The relationship between a content creator and their audience is often a "parasocial relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This type of relationship is unilateral and can ultimately be destructive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. While parasocial relationships are essential for a YouTuber's success, they are a double-edged sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. They can lead to viewer frustration when content doesn't meet their specific desires, such as incessant demands for new videos or direct messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

It's crucial to remember that creators are human beings with feelings, not merely products of their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. While constructive criticism is a necessary part of the dialogue and can be valuable for creative direction, the comments and expectations from viewers are a primary contributor to [[discussion_on_youtube_content_creation_challenges | creator burnout]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## Channel Content Strategy and the Algorithm

Many creators start their channels without a clear, predefined content niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. For example, one creator initially started YouTube to entertain and share, with no intention of it being solely a tech channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. In fact, less than half of their videos were tech-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. However, due to the way the [[youtube_algorithm_and_notifications | YouTube algorithm]] operates, some viewers might have only seen tech videos and thus assumed the creator's identity was exclusively tech-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This can lead to a creator feeling pigeonholed and prevented from exploring other creative interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### Solution: Diversifying Channels

To manage content strategy and audience expectations, especially when facing pressure from the [[youtube_algorithm_and_notifications | YouTube algorithm]], a creator might opt to start a new, separate channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This new channel can be dedicated to different types of content, such as lifestyle videos and vlogs, which may still include some tech topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This approach helps diversify content, allowing the main channel to evolve while also creating a separate space for "utility-based things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. The goal is to build an independent entity and expand the creator's "empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

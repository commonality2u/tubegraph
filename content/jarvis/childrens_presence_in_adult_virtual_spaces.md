Meta Horizon Worlds, Facebook's version of the metaverse, is described as a social experience where users can interact with real people in real time, and it is rated for teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:07">[02:56:07]</a>. Despite this rating, the platform often appears to be largely populated by children, significantly impacting the [[experience_of_living_in_the_metaverse | experience of living in the metaverse]] for adult users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:24">[09:19:24]</a>.

## Discrepancy in Demographics and Design
While Meta Horizon Worlds is rated for teens, the avatars available do not resemble teenagers, leading to a visual disconnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>. The developer notes a continuous influx of "software updates" and "forms" to establish a new "Meta identity" within the platform, a process that felt unexpectedly cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:15">[01:49:15]</a>.

The platform is advertised as a social experience with rules everyone must follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:19">[03:00:19]</a>. However, the observable reality suggests a significant presence of younger users.

## Children Overrunning Public Spaces
The creator's experience highlighted the prevalence of children in various public virtual environments:
*   **Comedy Club** The Soapstone Comedy Club, initially visited for entertainment, was found to be "overrun by pre-teens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:21">[09:25:21]</a>. Users identified as children, some even stating their age, were heard using slurs and offensive jokes, resembling a middle school cafeteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:57">[09:33:57]</a>. Despite a clear notice banning vulgarity, profanity, and derogatory jokes, these rules seemed to be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:19">[10:03:19]</a>.
*   **Bowling World** Upon entering a Bowling World, the user encountered what appeared to be an "actual infant" and another child doing a TikTok dance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:47">[11:09:47]</a>.
*   **Jail Simulator** Even a "jail simulator" world was found to be "full of kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:34">[13:40:34]</a>.

The app only became open to teens in April of the current year (2023), suggesting that the influx of children might be due to adults getting "bored with a stupid game," leading to a "Lord of the Flies" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:07">[11:53:07]</a>.

## Ineffective Age-Gating for Adults
While Meta has implemented features to "protect children from adults," there are "no tools to protect [adults] from children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:02">[13:34:02]</a>. Searching for "18 plus" worlds does reveal community-created spaces intended for adults, such as bars and clubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:09">[13:56:09]</a>. However, there is generally "nothing stopping a child from entering most of these bars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>, beyond the social deterrent of being ridiculed if they speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:44">[14:23:44]</a>.

One establishment, Gatsby's Bar, attempted to implement a "child lock" system by requiring users to stretch their arm span to exceed 4.9 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:13">[14:30:13]</a>. However, the creator questioned its effectiveness for shorter adults or taller teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:02">[14:53:02]</a>.

## Impact on Adult [[Social_interactions_in_virtual_reality | Social Interactions]]
The consistent presence of children makes it challenging for adults to find peers and engage in mature [[social_interactions_in_virtual_reality | social interactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:36">[12:13:36]</a>.
*   **Loneliness**: The user reported feeling "lonely" due to the difficulty of finding anyone their age to talk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:50">[12:11:50]</a>.
*   **Disrupted Conversations**: When adults are present, their conversations can be mundane or quickly taken over by children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:04">[12:55:04]</a>.
*   **Creator Experiences**: Simi Bro, a world developer and Meta partner, frequently experiences children "accosting him non-stop" while he tries to interact with adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:14">[24:14:14]</a>.
*   **Disruptive Behavior**: In a "Metacourt" role-playing world, children interrupted proceedings, created portals to other worlds, and struggled to sit still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:22">[29:03:22]</a>. In a virtual book club at the "Thrive Pavilion" (a senior center aimed at combating loneliness among older adults), a participant got "stuck in the pool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:17">[25:46:17]</a>, and a child later introduced a slur in a group singing songs around a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:56">[31:56:56]</a>.
*   **Adult Frustration**: Adults in the comedy club complained about "Kanto culture" and being unable to tell "real funny jokes" due to fear of moderation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:05">[31:35:05]</a>, indicating a general frustration with the child-dominated environment.

## Conclusion
The overwhelming presence of children, often engaging in disruptive or inappropriate behavior, significantly impacts the [[experience_of_living_in_the_metaverse | experience of living in the metaverse]] for adult users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:16">[35:52:16]</a>. Despite the platform's stated age rating and features aimed at protecting children, there's a clear lack of effective mechanisms to ensure a mature environment for adults. This leads to a largely abandoned landscape where the few populated worlds are often dominated by underage users, raising questions about Meta's claimed user numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:48:47">[35:48:47]</a>.

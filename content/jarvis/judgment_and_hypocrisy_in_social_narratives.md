"Not Always Right Comics" is an Instagram page that presents itself as a hybrid of user-submitted stories and webcomics, seemingly an offshoot of the "Not Always Right" website, which has existed since at least 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Similar to platforms like FML, "Not Always Right" serves as a platform where people submit stories complaining about others they perceive as being "not always right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Self-Serving Narratives and the "Karen" Trope
A significant issue with user-submitted stories, especially on platforms like "Not Always Right," is the tendency for the submitter to embellish narratives in which they emerge as the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Many of these stories come across as [[problems_with_selfcongratulatory_storytelling | self-congratulatory]] and appear to exist primarily for the author to "pat themselves on the back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

The comics frequently feature an "entitled parent or customer" who is subsequently "owned" or shown "what's what" by the protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. This often involves the stereotypical "Karen" character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>, characterized by a specific haircut and a judgmental attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

## Examples of Judgment and Hypocrisy

### The Tattoo Story
In one comic, a character referred to as "Karen" criticizes a school employee for having an ivy vine tattoo, suggesting it "could be a gang symbol or related to drugs like marijuana" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The Karen character labels the tattoo as "highly unprofessional" and threatens to report the employee to their boss for "advocating drugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. However, the story reveals Karen herself has a "tramp stamp" tattoo of two dolphins visible just above her jeans, highlighting her hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. The narrator points out that while Karen's tattoo is "fine," she is a hypocrite for judging someone else's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. This comic is criticized for creating a "hierarchy" of tattoos, where the protagonist's tattoo is presented as morally superior, allowing them to be the "moral victor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### The Hawaii Story
Another comic features a tourist in Hawaii who demands the local employee speak English, stating, "I'm sorry, I don't speak Spanish, could you talk in English please" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. This customer is later shown asking if the store accepts "American money," claiming she hasn't been able to get "currency exchange yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This highlights the customer's ignorance and prejudiced judgment, as Hawaii is part of the United States, and no currency exchange would be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. The story attempts to "take down bigotry" but is undermined by its unbelievable premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.

### The Tech Support Sexism Story
A third comic features a male customer calling tech support who immediately assumes the female employee is "reception" and demands to "talk to a man" for a technical problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. The story is structured to show the female tech support agent "owning" this sexist individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

### The Tech Support Homophobia Story
Another tech support comic portrays a customer trying to connect an iPod to a stereo. When the tech support agent mentions a "male to male RCA cable," the customer asks, "as in boy to boy?" and declares, "Well, you are just disgusting" before being hung up on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>. This comic aims to depict and counter homophobic judgment.

## Critique of Social Narratives
While many of these comics aim to highlight disrespect towards service workers and address issues like racism, sexism, and homophobia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>, they often come across as [[problems_with_selfcongratulatory_storytelling | wish fulfillment]] rather than genuinely plausible situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. The exaggerated and often unbelievable nature of the stories, particularly the "owning" moments, tends to undercut the intended moral message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

This pattern suggests that while the comics have "good intentions," their execution often falls short, resulting in "goofy" and unrealistic scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. The core issue remains the persistent desire for stories to be presented as "real," even when fictional narratives would suffice and avoid the pitfalls of [[narrative_analysis_of_fake_stories | unbelievable embellishment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>.

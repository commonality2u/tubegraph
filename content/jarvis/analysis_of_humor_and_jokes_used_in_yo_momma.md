MTV's 2006 series, *Yo Momma*, centered around contestants engaging in "Yo Momma" joke battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The humor in the show, while intended to be hilarious at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, is often seen through a different lens in a modern re-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The show's format largely involved contestants freestyling jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, with hosts looking for originality, delivery, quickness, and a strong "sting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Dominant Joke Tropes

The show heavily relied on a few recurring joke types:
*   **"Yo Mama So Fat" Jokes**
    *   This was predicted to be the most common joke type, potentially making up "a hundred percent" of the jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   Examples include: "My first words were, 'Yo, you so fat'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a> and "My mom is such a fat ass that when she walked past my TV, I missed the whole season of Making the Band" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
    *   The show is criticized for its fat-phobic nature due to the prevalence of these jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **"Yo Mama So Stupid" Jokes**
    *   An example: "Yo Mama's so stupid she thought Cheerios were donut seeds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
    *   Another example: "Yo mama's so dumb she thought this was a new soft drink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
    *   One contestant delivered "Yo mama's so stupid I rung the doorbell and she went and checked the microwave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, which was well-received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
*   **"Yo Mama So Old" Jokes**
    *   One contestant said, "Your mama's so old she knew Burger King when he was a prince" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This joke was considered unoriginal, having been heard since elementary school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, but the visual of a "Burger Prince" was found "rather funny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, earning it a 5/10 rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   Another age-related joke was: "Your mama saw Jesus in third grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Absurdist and Unique Humor

While many jokes were formulaic, some stood out for their absurdity:
*   "Your mom is so skinny you can see her farts coming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> was considered "one of the best jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   "Your mom breath think [sic] so bad she put a Tic Tac in her mouth, it crawled out and filed a restraining order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a> was appreciated for its absurd nature, deviating from typical "Yo Momma" themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   "Your mama's so short she got to use a sticky hand to get the toilet paper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a> was praised for its "absurdist sense of humor" and "physical element" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.
*   A joke about feet smelling like "boiled quarters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a> was found to be "so creative" and "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.

## Problematic and Cringe-worthy Humor

A significant portion of the humor in *Yo Momma* has not aged well and is viewed as problematic:
*   **Offensive Stereotypes**: Jokes about hair, particularly "black hair," were noted as being in "very bad taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. For example, "Your hair is so fake it says made in China on the back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a> was described as a "hate crime" and something that would lead to cancellation today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **Racist Remarks**: A joke like "You're so black you make Wesley Snipes look..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a> was immediately shut down as "not your joke to make" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.
*   **Lazy and Repetitive Humor**: Jokes such as "I am rubber and you are glue and your mama is a hoe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a> and "Your mom is a hooker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a> were deemed "lazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. One contestant, Jordan, notably repeated the "Hickory Dickory Dock, your mom's a dirty h**" joke multiple times, including as his "closer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>, which was criticized for its lack of originality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Misogynistic Undertones**: Jokes about women's bodies and perceived promiscuity were common.
*   **Unclear Jokes**: Some jokes, like "Your mother's a Portuguese Stretch Markie," were met with confusion as to their meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

## Contestant and Host Dynamics

The humor was also shaped by the personalities involved:
*   **[[Role and presentation of Wilmer Valderrama on Yo Momma | Wilmer Valderrama]]**: As the host, [[Role and presentation of Wilmer Valderrama on Yo Momma | Wilmer Valderrama]] often appeared to be trying to reinvent his image from *That '70s Show* into a "cool guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. However, he frequently outsourced the show's rules and heavy lifting to other staff, appearing only halfway through episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. His hosting style was often found "interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> and sometimes "gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a> due to his personal stories or seemingly inappropriate comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
*   **Contestant Persona**: Jordan, a contestant representing "rich kids who think they are tough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, was often seen as an "industry plant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> whose humor (and persona) was viewed with disdain, being described as "insufferable" even after losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. His apparent appropriation of AAVE and problematic jokes garnered strong negative reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. In contrast, Kenny, who delivered more absurd and creative jokes, became a favored contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

## Overall Critique of Humor
The [[Critique on the format and execution of Yo Momma | humor in Yo Momma]] is largely seen as a product of its time, designed for immediate enjoyment in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Many jokes lacked originality and were considered "crusty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>, often relying on simple "fat" or "stupid" tropes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The use of "Yo Momma" jokes in a competitive setting also highlighted the cultural and potentially problematic elements of such humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. While some absurd jokes stood out, the overall comedic content and its delivery by certain contestants were considered outdated and offensive upon re-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

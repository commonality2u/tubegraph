Ready-to-eat meal services offer a convenient solution for those with busy schedules, making it easier to meet nutritional goals and avoid less healthy food options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. These services deliver pre-prepared meals that are ready to heat and eat in as little as two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Benefits of Meal Services

*   **Time-Saving** By providing meals ready in just two minutes, these services help individuals save time on cooking and meal preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This is particularly useful during busy periods, like the holiday season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Nutritional Support** Services like Factor create meals using "ingredients of integrity" to help consumers feel their best throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Variety and Customization** Factor offers 34 meal options per week, along with over 36 add-ons, including juices, smoothies, and snacks, providing significant variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. They also offer "Gourmet Plus" for upscale options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Financial and Health Benefits** Having prepared meals in the fridge helps prevent eating unhealthy foods or spending too much on takeout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Comparison to Social Media Trends
The individual notes a contrast between using convenient services like Factor and the time spent scrolling social media for potentially "useless" products, such as those found through [[shopping_challenges_inspired_by_social_media | TikTok products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, highlighting the appeal of convenience over novelty.

The year 2020 saw [[jake_paul_and_private_life_boundaries | Jake Paul]] experience significant growth and learning, according to his own accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. He tweeted about the importance of not having all the answers, being okay with failure, and the inevitability of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. However, subsequent events would challenge this self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## Clashes with YouTube and Dangerous Content
[[jake_paul_and_private_life_boundaries | Jake Paul]] publicly criticized YouTube for holding him accountable for his actions, claiming the platform was "punishing" him as one of their "riskiest creators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. He alleged YouTube had him "shadow banned" and would not promote his videos to subscribers, deeming them "unsuitable for their audience" and a "publicity risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. The counter-argument to his stance was that his videos constituted "dangerous content" and that he was not a positive influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. He likened YouTube's actions to oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## Calabasas Mansion Party and COVID-19 Concerns
In August 2020, footage emerged of a large, "out of control" party at [[jake_paul_and_private_life_boundaries | Jake Paul]]'s mansion in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Reports highlighted that partygoers were not wearing masks or social distancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. The footage also showed dangerous stunts, such as guests precariously dangling and falling from an excavator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Media coverage of the event often focused on the lack of social distancing and masks, leading to a satirical analysis by the speaker suggesting absurdly dangerous activities like "human catapults" were being overlooked in favor of mask-wearing concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

[[jake_paul_and_private_life_boundaries | Jake Paul]] responded to criticism by tweeting "grass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. After the party, creator Tanner Fox, who attended, tested positive for coronavirus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. A call between [[jake_paul_and_private_life_boundaries | Jake Paul]] and Tanner Fox showed them laughing and not taking the diagnosis seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. During the call, someone in the background was heard yelling, "We don't care!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## Creator Houses and the "Fear of Missing Clout" (FOMC)
The video introduces the concept of a "pandemic sweeping the nation" related to a new strain of FOMO called "FOMC," or the "fear of missing clout," which affects young YouTubers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This phenomenon is linked to the trend of "creator houses" — homes almost exclusively for TikTok creators — such as Hype House, Sway House, and Alpha House <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. These houses became notorious for hosting large "quarantine ragers" without masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

Influencers attending these parties often made excuses, with the "worst" being that partying was part of their "job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. Thomas Petru, a founder of Hype House, stated their job was to entertain, and they couldn't put their lives on hold for a year and stop making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. This rationale was dismissed as "straight up teen logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

## Lack of Consequences and Ongoing Behavior
Despite the criticism, [[jake_paul_and_private_life_boundaries | Jake Paul]] initially faced no consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. His brand is described as living out a reality show in real life, making it difficult for him to "stop for a pandemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>. There is "clout to be gained," "beef to start," and "merch to sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:00]</a>.

The Mayor of Los Angeles threatened to shut off water and power at creator houses if they continued partying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>. While this was eventually enforced at one point, [[jake_paul_and_private_life_boundaries | Jake Paul]]'s response indicated he was taking it with a flippant attitude, stating, "suddenly the turns have tabled," and then admitting, "we deserve it, it is illegal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>. When he confirmed he did not have coronavirus, fans expressed relief, but the speaker argued this missed the point that social distancing and avoiding parties were still necessary, regardless of individual COVID-19 status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>. The overall problem highlighted is that despite knowing their actions are detrimental, these influencers continue to party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>.

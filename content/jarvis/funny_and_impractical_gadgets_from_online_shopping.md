Inspired by reviewing strange TikTok home products on "Good Mythical Morning," one content creator decided to purchase a variety of products found on TikTok to test their [[shopping_challenges_inspired_by_social_media | utility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The goal was to buy and try every possible product that caught their eye from the social media platform, even if they didn't remember what they bought after a couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Gadget Showcase

### Multi-functional Cleaning Brush
This "seven-in-one keyboard cleaner kit" is designed for cleaning laptops, computers, headphones, tablets, and screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. It includes a soft dusting brush, a "three-in-one" AirPod cleaning pen, a key puller, and a spray bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. While the brush effectively dusted a keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, it struggled with dried slobber on an iPad screen until an unlabeled cleaning liquid was sprayed on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The product was noted for its various small tools for cleaning "nooks and crannies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, and was considered "efficient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> and "not bad by any means" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

### Automatic Drink Dispenser
This product, titled "magic electric tap automatic drink dispenser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, promised automated pouring of beverages, but was found to be highly [[practicality_and_humor_in_diy_life_hacks | impractical]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It required AA batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a> and featured a flimsy, cheap plastic construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The dispenser produced a "pathetic stream of water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> and was likened to "a birth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> and "slobbering out the drink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Its internal tube was disturbingly described as looking like a "vein" or "umbilical cord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The creator humorously suggested it solves a "real problem" and gave it a 10 out of 10, despite it being clearly [[life_hacks_and_their_practicality | impractical]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Soup Fat Oil Separator Ladle
Initially appearing to be a special ladle capable of separating fat from soup in a TikTok video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, the product received was "literally just a ladle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The creator realized the "magic of TikTok had convinced me to just buy a regular kitchen utensil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Shower Foot Massage Pad
Described as a "furry butt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, this item is a foot massage pad designed for use in the shower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. It features suction cups on the back to attach to a surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The host noted it simply "feels like rubber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a> and expressed concern about potential skin breakouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Ice Ball Makers
The creator sought a spherical ice maker seen on TikTok but encountered a common online shopping pitfall: different prices for seemingly identical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. They purchased one from Amazon for $27 and another from AliExpress for $2.83, suspecting the Amazon seller was dropshipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

*   **The Scam Ice Tray**: The AliExpress purchase, despite appearing as the spherical maker in most photos, delivered a "comically small ice tray" with a useless lid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. It produced "tiny ice" that was "not even that good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, leading the creator to conclude they were "bamboozled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **The Spherical Ice Bottle**: The more expensive purchase from Amazon was an "ice cube making bottle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. After struggling to open it (it was a screw top, not a pull-off lid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>, it produced ice that was "not exactly what I would call a ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>, more like "a planet with like a ring around it" or "Saturns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. The result was "a more complicated way to make regular ice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a> and "a little disappointing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

### Back Straightener
This device, made of "flimsy cheap plastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, was intended to assist with back posture. The host jokingly commented on their own "pretty straight back" in contrast to the product's advertised effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

### Giant Turtle Shell Cushion
One of the most anticipated purchases was a "creative spoof Turtle B Doll" or [[exploring_odd_and_impractical_furniture_design | "big turtle shell"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. This item, costing $52.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, arrived vacuum-sealed like a mattress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. It revealed itself to be a "giant turtle shell that people lie on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, featuring armholes and functioning as a cushion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. Despite its clear impracticality, the host enthusiastically embraced it, declaring, "This is sick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a> and "I'm never taking this off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>, even scaring their dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

## Conclusion
The creator, donning the turtle shell, humorously reflected on the "awesome totally practical hacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a> they tested. The highlights included the turtle shell and the back straightener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. The lowlights were the mysterious microneedle derma roller (which was not ordered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a> and the "not practical" drink dispenser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. Overall, the experience was "pleasantly surprised" with the items, concluding that "things could be worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

[[TikTok pranks and trends | TikTok]] has become a platform where pranks are "basically unavoidable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. While some believe that gaining popularity on the app requires no talent or creativity due to imitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, there's a nuanced view that acknowledges interesting content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. However, when it comes to [[TikTok pranks and trends | TikTok pranks]], they often fall into categories ranging from fake to real, and even a combination of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Jackson O'Doherty and Kristen Hanby: The "Prank-in-a-Challenge" Bros

Two prominent [[TikTok pranks and trends | TikTok pranksters]] are Australian brothers Jackson O'Doherty and Kristen Hanby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Their content often blends pranks with challenges, where one friend issues a random phrase like "get rid of it" to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The target then acts surprised but knows exactly what to do, suggesting a pre-arranged agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This usually results in them begrudgingly performing an obnoxious act, often causing a public disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

Examples of their "get rid of it" challenge include:
*   Throwing a Subway sandwich on the ground after it's been prepared, much to the horror of the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The person performing the prank often appears upset, despite being the one causing the disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The speaker questions who the joke is on, especially when service people are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   Throwing a glass bottle of liquor onto the ground, causing glass to fly and potentially injuring people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Destroying a watch, asking "How will I tell the time now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Pouring water on themselves in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   Refusing to pay taxes, saying "get rid of it" as if it's a game, despite it being a felony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Most people in these videos pay them no mind, possibly because these pranksters do this often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. While they are big on [[TikTok pranks and trends | TikTok]], they are "huge" on Instagram, where they also post videos of themselves harassing people while wearing a jockstrap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. They have many imitators, including a couple who seemingly imitated their style even for a marriage proposal involving police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

These pranks often use hashtags like `#funny` and `#friends` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Michael Fallon TV: The "Comedian" Prankster

Another [[TikTok pranks and trends | TikTok prankster]], Michael Fallon TV, considers himself a comedian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. One of his sketches is disturbingly titled "when you pick up a disabled hitchhiker," which the speaker deemed too inappropriate to show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

His pranks are technically "more tasteful" than his sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>:
*   **"That friend who's always on their phone dot dot not anymore"**: This prank involves throwing a friend's phone into oncoming traffic, despite the clear danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The speaker notes the unlikeliness of the scenario, especially the friend "tanning in the middle of the boardwalk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **"How to stop someone from eating unhealthy"**: This involves destroying someone's food, for example, by throwing a pizza slice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **"How to stop someone from over exercising"**: This involves similar destructive actions, such as removing exercise equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

Fallon also features in "dare or get slapped" videos, where he immediately performs an obnoxious act without question rather than get slapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Examples include stealing a bike and riding it into a river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, or jumping on a table and acting like a monkey in a public place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The speaker highlights the near-instant reaction time to these dares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, and expresses sympathy for bystanders like a girl trying to take a phone call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## The Nature and [[The Ethics of Staging Prank Videos | Impact of Prank Videos]]

The speaker suggests that making a "good prank" is "nearly impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. A prank's success depends on variables like the target's sense of humor; it can't go "too far" and become harassment, nor "too easy" and be boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. An example of a prank with unexpected consequences was shared: college friends sent a fake email from the Dean advertising a "testing program from Aperture Science" (from the *Portal* video game) on April Fool's Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Despite being harmless, they were suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

Many people take the risk of performing pranks for the potential reward of gaining "five [[TikTok pranks and trends | TikTok]] followers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Matt James's season as [[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]] was met with significant disappointment, failing to meet even the low expectations viewers often have for the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The season's narrative diverged from the franchise's typical formula, leading to a controversial and unsatisfying viewing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Casting and Introduction
Matt James was announced as the first Black Bachelor, a significant and historic moment for the franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. However, his casting broke from the show's established pattern, which typically selects a Bachelor from a previous season's contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Instead, [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | producers]] "fast-tracked" Matt, who had never appeared on *The Bachelor* or [[analysis_of_the_bachelorette_and_its_contestants | The Bachelorette]] as a contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. He was described as an "outsider" and a "false king" due to this unconventional path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

His background included working with kids, jobs in finance and real estate, and a friendship with a popular [[analysis_of_the_bachelorette_and_its_contestants | Bachelorette]] contestant, which was noted as his only "cool" attribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. While the announcement of the first Black Bachelor was welcomed, some viewers, including the speaker, had hoped for Mike Johnson to be cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Matt himself spoke about the pressure of being the first Black Bachelor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Character and Interactions
Throughout the season, Matt James was characterized as an "inert Bachelor" who didn't "do much of anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. His interactions with contestants were often described as robotic and impersonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. A notable example was his frequent response of "Thank you for sharing that" when contestants expressed their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. He was also observed to kiss with his eyes open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

## Focus on Drama Over Romance
Instead of developing [[overview_of_the_bachelor | the Bachelor]]'s relationships with the contestants, the [[producers_role_in_creating_drama_on_the_bachelor | producers]] chose to emphasize petty drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This focus on manufactured conflict often overshadowed genuine emotional connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Examples of this dynamic include:
*   **Sarah's Departure**: A contestant named Sarah, who was the caretaker for her father with ALS, struggled with the show's rules preventing contact with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. She was "ganged up on" by other girls, and her eventual decision to leave the show was celebrated by some contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The show's environment was criticized for not being hospitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Escort Rumors**: Another significant drama involved contestant Anna baselessly claiming that new arrival Brittany was an escort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This rumor led to Brittany's name being associated with "escort" in online searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Matt's response to this serious accusation was seen as inadequate, merely stating that "Chicago's a small town" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, despite Chicago being the third most populous city in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Family and Finale
Matt's family played a significant role in the latter part of the season. His mother, who raised him, and his brother, described as an excellent interviewer, met the final two contestants, Michelle and Rachel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

A controversial and "bad idea" plot point was the appearance of Matt's estranged father on the show to "clear the air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. This ten-minute segment was deemed highly uncomfortable and inappropriate for a dating game show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

Ultimately, Matt did not propose to Rachel, his chosen partner, after his mother advised him that "love doesn't exist" and feelings fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. He broke up with Michelle, who had personalized jerseys made for them, with little explanation or closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

## Racial Issues and Aftermath
[[racial_issues_and_controversies_within_the_bachelor | Racial issues]] became a central, and poorly handled, part of Matt's season. Front-runner Rachel Kirkconnell faced scrutiny for attending an antebellum-themed sorority party in Georgia in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This period of the American South was defined by slavery, making the celebration a "bad look" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

[[overview_of_the_bachelor | Bachelor]] host Chris Harrison defended Rachel's actions in an interview with Rachel Lindsay, the first Black [[analysis_of_the_bachelorette_and_its_contestants | Bachelorette]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Harrison's attempts to minimize the controversy, questioning whether it was a "good look in 2018 or 2021" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a> and claiming "50 million people did that in 2018" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, were widely criticized. This interview led to Rachel Lindsay being harassed online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> and Chris Harrison's eventual replacement for the "After the Final Rose" special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

In the aftershow, hosted by Emmanuel Acho, Matt explained that he broke up with Rachel because they were "coming from different life experiences" and he didn't want to be the one to "teach her what it's like to be black in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. Rachel acknowledged her learning process after the online discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. Matt later had to delete his Instagram posts due to harassment he received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. The show's [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | producers]] were criticized for setting up situations that put contestants in "very rough situations for drama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a> without making for good television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

Despite the on-air breakup, Matt and Rachel were spotted together recently, suggesting a reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

## Overall [[critique_of_the_bachelor_as_a_television_show | Critique of The Bachelor as a television show]]
The season was broadly deemed a failure, with the sentiment that "the show is bad" and the production was "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. The speaker stated that the show's practice of "messing with people's lives for entertainment has gone too far" and expressed that this would likely be the last time they discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

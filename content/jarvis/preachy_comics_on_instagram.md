This article discusses "Not Always Right Comics," an Instagram page that features webcomics based on user-submitted stories. The comics are critiqued for their unbelievable plots, self-congratulatory tone, and stereotypical portrayals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>.

## Origin and Format
"Not Always Right Comics" appears to be a hybrid of [[critique_of_animated_story_channels | animated stories]] that claim to be real and a webcomic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. It is an offshoot of a website called "Not Always Right," which has been active since at least 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. The website provides a platform for people to submit stories where they complain about others in their lives who are "not always right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. The concept is reminiscent of sites like FML (F*ck My Life), where users submit stories about unfortunate events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of the Comics
While the stories claim to be user-submitted and real, they often read as wish fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Many revolve around individuals in service jobs dealing with rude or mean customers and parents who are "in the wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. A common theme is the narrator "owning" or embarrassing an entitled individual, often a "Karen" archetype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. The stories frequently seem designed for the person who wrote them to pat themselves on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

### Critiqued Examples

#### The Tattoo Hypocrite
One comic features a school employee with an ivy vine tattoo on her foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. After taking off her wet shoes, children notice and touch the tattoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. A "Karen" character then confronts her, shaming her for setting a bad example and suggesting the ivy could be a "gang symbol or related to drugs like marijuana" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. The comic's twist reveals the "Karen" herself has a "tramp stamp" (a dolphin tattoo on her lower back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

> [!critique] Analysis
> The comic uses the "Karen" archetype, identifiable by her stereotypical haircut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. While aiming to expose hypocrisy, the comic introduces a "hierarchy" of tattoos, implying one tattoo is "bad" while the other is "moral," which can be seen as [[criticism_of_societal_and_cultural_stereotypes_in_comics | slut-shaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. The scenario is deemed unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

#### The Geographically Challenged Tourist
Another comic depicts a tourist in Hawaii who responds to a greeting of "Aloha" by stating they don't speak Spanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. The tourist then claims to have "just flew here from America" and asks if the Hawaiian store takes "American money," unaware that Hawaii is a U.S. state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

> [!critique] Analysis
> The comic attempts to tackle bigotry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. However, the scenario is highly unbelievable, as a traveler with knowledge of currency exchange would likely know they traveled domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. This unbelievable premise undercuts the comic's intended point against ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.

#### The Velcro Wall Entitlement
A comic showcases an entitled parent insisting her child must ride a velcro wall, despite a long line and the ride closing soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. She claims her son has a "lifelong dream" of being suspended by a velcro jumpsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. After leaving and returning post-closure, she demands the ride be reopened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. The comic ends with the employee directing her complaints to "the clown over there," who is revealed to be the boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

> [!critique] Analysis
> The language used in these comics is often described as "very strange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. The plot points, such as the sudden appearance of a clown boss, are considered nonsensical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

#### Tech Support Scenarios
A favorite subsection of these comics focuses on tech support, often featuring "unreasonable and stupid people that don't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

*   **Sexism:** A man calls tech support and demands to speak to a male, only to find the female representative is the only one who can help him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. The comic is about "owning the human personification of sexism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.
*   **Ignorance of Connectivity:** A businessman on a Caltrain in Silicon Valley insists on immediate internet service, unaware of maintenance in his zone or that his train schedule doesn't run at 4 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. He even asks if the tech support can "move the satellite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>.
*   **Homophobia:** A man attempting to connect his iPod asks for clarification on a "male-to-male RCA cable," questioning if it means "boy to boy" and reacting with disgust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. The tech support agent hangs up on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>.
*   **The DVD Player Porn Incident:** A customer brings in a "broken" DVD player, which the manager hooks up to the store's sound system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>. The "problem" is that the DVD was inserted upside down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:36:00">[20:36:00]</a>. Upon flipping it, a "grotesque scene of a cheesy porn" blasts through the store's speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.

> [!critique] Analysis
> These comics aim to include "woke trifecta" elements (racism, sexism, homophobia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. However, the scenarios are often so outlandish and the characters so caricatured that they undermine the intended message, creating an unbelievable narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. The tech support comics are especially noted for their unrealistic premises, such as a customer not knowing how to use a DVD player in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
While "Not Always Right Comics" may have good intentions, particularly in highlighting the disrespect faced by people in service positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>, their execution often results in "goofy" and unbelievable wish fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. The primary criticism is not that the comics are harmful, but that they present overly simplistic, often stereotypical situations as "real" user-submitted stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. The question is posed: why is there a fascination with stories being real when fictional stories are perfectly acceptable, provided they are not falsely presented as factual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>?

These comics exemplify [[critique_of_fake_animated_stories | fake animated stories]] in their attempt to be authentic but ultimately fall short due to their exaggerated nature.

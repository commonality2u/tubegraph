Content houses bring together creators to produce various forms of online content, often blurring the lines between their real lives and their online personas. While some content houses aim for an authentic portrayal of their members' lives, others deliberately create a fictional reality, akin to a scripted show. This approach is exemplified by content houses like "Retirement House."

## Retirement House: A Fictional Reality Show
"Retirement House" is presented as a content house where the members are older individuals, but the content itself functions as a [[dramatization_and_editing_in_reality_tv | fictional reality show]] where "everybody's just playing a character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This format mirrors traditional content houses like "Hype House," which was known for its dancing teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Despite the members being actors, the narrative aims to mimic the dynamic of a genuine content house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The show's creators utilize [[dramatization_and_editing_in_reality_tv | editing]] to create a cohesive narrative, which can sometimes be difficult to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Characters and Their Storylines
The members of "Retirement House" each embody distinct characters with ongoing storylines:
*   **Eugene** is depicted as a "heartthrob" and "fashion icon" with unique glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. There's even speculation about whether he's a young person wearing old-person makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. His character often features dating storylines, showing off his outfits and seeking a "queen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Mabel** is the "sassy one," often seen flipping people off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Peaches** has a remarkably youthful appearance, leading to playful speculation that she might be a "time traveler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Larry** begins as a background character in rap videos, notable for being "in the back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. His character then becomes central to a dramatic reveal when Eugene "outs" him as an exotic dancer, provoking a strong reaction from Larry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Curtis** mentions having a "bad back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> and expresses a desire for the "Retirement House" to be on Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Rose** is involved in a "flip off" battle with Mabel, showcasing the escalating "drama" within the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

The show integrates various [[reality_tv_show_editing_and_narrative | narrative elements]], including freestyle rapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, dating adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, and even takes on pop culture events like the Kanye West and Pete Davidson drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Production and Authenticity
While "Retirement House" portrays its members as actors playing roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, it also uniquely pulls back the curtain on the "unseen challenges" of being a senior citizen influencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This meta-commentary highlights the effort involved in producing viral content, even if it's fictional. The high [[netflix_reality_tv_production | production quality]] suggests it may be run by a "big production company with some zingy writers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, although its financial justification from TikTok earnings alone is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

Despite its fictional nature, the show also includes segments that share the "real story and backgrounds of the people in the house," discussing the "long and fulfilling lives they've led" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This blend of fiction and glimpses into reality contributes to its inspirational aspect, making the concept of aging "feel okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The hope is expressed that there is no "seedy underbelly" to the production given its positive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

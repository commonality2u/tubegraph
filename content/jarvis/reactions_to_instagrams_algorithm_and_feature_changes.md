In mid-2022, widespread frustration erupted among Instagram users and creators over significant changes to the app's algorithm and features, particularly its pronounced shift towards video content, specifically "Reels." Many users expressed dismay at the platform's perceived abandonment of its photo-sharing roots in an attempt to mimic rival apps like [[influence_of_apps_like_tiktok_on_instagram | TikTok]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The "Make Instagram Instagram Again" Movement

The discontent reached a peak when prominent influencers, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, reposted an image from artist Tati Bruening that read "Make Instagram Instagram Again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This post, which included a call to share it and sign a Change.org petition, quickly garnered over 2 million likes and 300,000 petition signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

The petition voiced several key demands:
*   **Bring back chronological timelines:** Users wanted to see posts from friends in the order they were published, rather than an algorithmic feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This is a common criticism faced by platforms like Facebook and Twitter when they transitioned to algorithmic feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Focus on photos:** The petition argued for a return to Instagram's original purpose of photo sharing, noting that video was only added due to competition (e.g., Vine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Listen to creators:** A significant point was the perceived lack of consideration for creators, particularly photographers, who felt forced to alter their content strategy to align with the new algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

The critique highlighted that while the complaints were valid, the petition itself was viewed by some as "silly" or "corny" given the nature of corporate decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The historical narrative of Instagram as a purely "instantaneous" and "in-the-moment" app was also contested, with observations that it has always been a "vain vanity app" used for curated or filtered content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

It was noted that the loudest complaints often came from influencers with significant financial incentives tied to the platform, such as the Kardashians, who have historically leveraged Instagram for sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Instagram's Response and Rationale

Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri issued a video statement following the backlash, aiming to clarify the ongoing changes and address user concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

He conveyed:
*   **Full-screen feed tests:** Instagram was experimenting with a full-screen feed for both videos and photos, aiming for a more "fun, engaging experience." He acknowledged it was "not yet good" but indicated it was a direction they intended to pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Continued photo support:** Mosseri stated that photos would continue to be supported as part of Instagram's heritage, but honestly admitted that "more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. He cited a perceived user shift towards sharing and consuming more video content, a trend he attributed to evolving technology and increasing bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. This claim was met with skepticism, suggesting that Instagram was "putting [its] thumb on the scale" by prioritizing video in the feed, thereby artificially increasing video consumption and engagement metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **Recommendations:** Mosseri explained that recommended posts from accounts users don't follow are intended to help users "discover new and interesting things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. This feature, common in apps like YouTube, aims to increase user time on the app by providing a continuous stream of content beyond that of their immediate friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. While acknowledging that some recommendations might be irrelevant, he suggested users could "x out" unwanted suggestions or temporarily "snooze" all recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. He also highlighted the "following feed" as an alternative for those who prefer to see only content from accounts they follow, though this is not the default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

These explanations were largely interpreted as corporate PR messaging designed to justify changes already planned, rather than a genuine response to user dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

## [[Impact of Instagram changes on users and creators | Impact on Creators]]

The shift significantly impacted creators, particularly photographers, who found their reach diminished unless they adapted to producing Reels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Data from one user's feed indicated that 50% of posts were Reels, with 80% of those Reels being suggested content from accounts not followed by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This dramatically reduced visibility for traditional photo content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

Creators felt compelled to switch to video, not out of desire, but necessity for growth, as photos experienced a more than 90% drop in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. This sentiment was echoed by influencers like James Charles, who publicly criticized the platform for forcing creators into a video-first strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. The argument was made that photographers should not have to create "cringy reels" for their art to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

Instagram's claim to support "creators" through recommendations was seen as disingenuous by many photo-focused artists, as suggested posts were almost exclusively Reels, benefiting only video creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

## Underlying Reasons: Profit Motive and [[competition_and_feature_copying_by_instagram | Feature Copying]]

The primary driver for these changes is Instagram's (and parent company Meta's) profit motive and desire to increase engagement and ad revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. Instagram aims to become the most profitable app possible, even if it means "ruffling feathers" among existing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

Instagram has a history of [[history_and_evolution_of_instagram | evolving]] and [[competition_and_feature_copying_by_instagram | copying features]] from competitors to stay relevant:
*   Originally a mobile check-in app (like Foursquare) in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   Shifted to photo-sharing with filters as its differentiating feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   Acquired by Facebook in 2012 for $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   Introduced 15-second looping video to compete with Vine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   Copied disappearing messages and, most notably, "Stories" from Snapchat, which significantly impacted [[snapchat_discovers_evolution_and_issues | Snapchat's user base]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   Attempted a direct [[influence_of_apps_like_tiktok_on_instagram | TikTok]] clone called "Lasso" which failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   Integrated Reels directly into Instagram, forcing all video uploads to become Reels, to leverage its existing user base for a TikTok-like experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

The strategic goal is to keep users on the app for as long as possible, viewing more ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. More video content inherently leads to longer engagement times than static photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This focus on maximizing engagement and growth, especially as Facebook itself experiences slower growth, drives the shift, with little "allegiance to its users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite the backlash, the changes on Instagram, particularly the prominence of Reels, appear to be a successful strategy for the company in terms of engagement and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. The changes are expected to be permanent, reflecting that companies prioritize shareholder value over user sentiment when a clear path to increased revenue is identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. Casual users, who constitute the majority, may not critically analyze the platform's direction, allowing Instagram to proceed with its business model shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.

For creators, adapting to new platform priorities is often a necessity for continued growth and livelihood, highlighting their [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | beholden nature]] to the platforms they use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. While the current changes may be frustrating for photo creators, the dynamic nature of social media suggests that new apps and methods of expression will likely emerge in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

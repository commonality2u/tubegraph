The YouTube channel 123 Go! has garnered 1.6 million subscribers since February and frequently appears on trending lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Described as the 5-Minute Crafts creators attempting to imitate Troom Troom, 123 Go! combines "weird life hacks" with "weird life hacks and pranks but with characters" and voice-overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Despite claiming to be the "most relatable channel on YouTube," its content is often perceived as bizarre and unrelatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The "Relatable Situations" Video

One video, titled "Relatable situations anybody can recognize," topped trending charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. However, it was deemed "the most unrelatable video" ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The video showcases scenarios that quickly escalate into absurdity, challenging the premise of `[[brands_using_social_media_for_relatable_content | relatable content]]`.

### Uncanny Language and Inconsistent Narration

A recurring motif in 123 Go! videos is that "nothing is quite right," creating an "uncanny valley of language" where things are close enough to be uncomfortable but don't quite fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. For instance, a clogged toilet is referred to as a "piping mishap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The narrator's voice also shifts inconsistently, sometimes speaking as the character, and other times speaking to the character or a phantom audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Bizarre Scenarios and Reactions

The video presents several "relatable" situations with highly unusual resolutions:

*   **Spider Encounter**: A character sees a spider "as big as [her] face" and, instead of trying to remove it, packs a suitcase with clothes from the "crime scene" to flee to a hotel for "two, three days," hoping the "hideous thing" will die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The decision to pack in the exact location of the spider is particularly illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Dirty Dishes**: A character expresses frustration over a sink full of dirty dishes but then only washes a single mug, proclaiming "first dish done! That wasn't so bad!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. A "true piping mishap" occurs when water aggressively sprays from a spoon being washed, suggesting a "water demon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Broken Nail**: A character struggles to pick up a coffee pod with her false nails, despite them being clearly artificial, making the "high force activity" ill-advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Grocery Haul**: To prepare for carrying groceries, a character performs push-ups in front of an Enterprise rental car, then brings an entire grocery haul into an empty, white background room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## School Pranks and DIYs

123 Go! also features pranks and DIY content, often described as a copy of Troom Troom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This highlights a `[[discussion_on_content_originality_and_reuse | discussion on content originality and reuse]]` in the online space.

### Questionable Pranks

The "seven funny DIY school pranks" video presents instructions for pranks that are either impractical, illogical, or involve potentially dangerous items for the target audience:

*   **Play-Doh Gum Prank**: The video suggests cutting Play-Doh into a square with an exacto knife and placing it in an empty gum wrapper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This raises questions about the intended audience, as it involves children using box cutters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The prank's flaw is that gum is typically individually wrapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Soy Sauce and Sprite "Coke"**: A prank involves mixing Sprite and soy sauce to mimic Coke. The concoction is described as having a "dark color" and smelling "like death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The `[[the_use_of_extreme_content_for_social_media_engagement | extreme content]]` of the smell and the immediate, strong reaction of the person drinking it make the scenario completely unbelievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Carrots and Banana "Chocolate" Swap**: A character stuffs carrots and a "peak ripe" banana (described as "from 2015" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>) into an empty chocolate box to trick someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The recipient is expected to be fooled despite the obvious weight difference and the visual appearance of the swapped items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

### Unrealistic Setting

The "school" setting in these videos features bizarre elements, such as a school lunch hall with a wooden pepper grinder and a student reading a microwave manual or a "social strategy" book, further detaching the content from any semblance of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. The ages of the characters often appear ambiguous or inconsistent with the situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

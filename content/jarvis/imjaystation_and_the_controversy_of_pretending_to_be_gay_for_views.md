The YouTube channel ImJayStation has been criticized for creating sensationalized content, particularly videos targeting a young audience with disturbing or offensive themes. A notable controversy involves a series of videos where creators pretend to drink a "gay potion" purchased from the "dark web" to elicit reactions and views. These videos are primarily aimed at [[exploitation_of_preteens_for_monetization_on_youtube | preteens]] and rely on homophobic stereotypes for their comedic premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

## Content for Preteens on YouTube

While YouTube has specific content for the youngest children, there's a significant amount of content targeting preteens (ages 10-12), despite the platform's 13+ age rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>. This demographic attracts creators seeking to "squeeze the ad dollars out of them like little sponges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>.

A prominent sub-genre that preys on this age group is the "3 A.M. Challenge," where YouTubers film themselves engaging in creepy or supernatural activities at 3 A.M. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>. ImJayStation is identified as one of the "worst offenders" in this genre, with a channel described as a "cornucopia of upsetting content," featuring characters like Freddy Krueger, Mike Myers, and Cookie Monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:05">[01:54:05]</a>. He has also been criticized for disrespectful content, such as claiming to talk to the spirit of Mac Miller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:14">[02:08:14]</a>.

## The "Gay Potion" Trend

A newer trend involves creators "pretending to order magic potions from the dark web" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:07">[02:21:07]</a>. These potions are supposedly capable of granting strange powers like shape-shifting or teleporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:05">[02:37:05]</a>. ImJayStation's videos in this trend, particularly the "gay potion" series, have drawn significant controversy.

### The "We Kissed Ordering Gay Potion from the Dark Web at 3 AM" Video

This video's premise is that "being gay is like spooky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:15">[03:11:15]</a>. ImJayStation and his friend J Hills claim to have found a "gay potion" that, when consumed, will "turn anybody gay for exactly one hour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:05">[03:52:05]</a>.

Key problematic elements of the video include:
*   **Homophobic Premise**: The entire video's "comedy" hinges on [[discussion_on_the_consequences_of_homophobic_content_and_representation_in_media | systemic homophobia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:05">[05:11:05]</a>, treating being gay as a terrifying or undesirable temporary state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:15">[04:22:15]</a>.
*   **Insistence on Heterosexuality**: The creators repeatedly assert their straightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:10">[04:35:10]</a>, despite being full-grown adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:05">[04:48:05]</a>.
*   **Stereotypical Portrayals**: After drinking the potion, J Hills exhibits grossly stereotypical "gay" behavior, including an exaggerated voice and non-consensual touching of ImJayStation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:05">[07:59:05]</a>. The video later devolves into using stereotypes about women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:05">[10:06:05]</a>.
*   **Non-Consensual Contact**: A significant plot point involves J Hills attempting to force himself on ImJayStation, chasing him around and "pounc[ing] on him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:05">[10:48:05]</a>. This is played for cartoonish laughs.
*   **Fear of Being Perceived as Gay**: ImJayStation requests J Hills to delete a photo taken while "gay" because he's "afraid people think he's gay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:05">[09:12:05]</a>.

### The "Gay Potion" Trilogy and Kermit the Frog

The "gay potion" narrative extends into two more videos. In a subsequent video, Kermit the Frog supposedly holds ImJayStation's channel hostage, forcing him to drink the "gay potion" again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:12">[12:08:12]</a>. The effects portrayed are identical to the first video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:05">[14:05:05]</a>. The third video, "We Made Out Making Kermit the Frog Drink the Gay Potion," involves ImJayStation forcing Kermit to drink the potion and then making out with the puppet sensually to Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:05">[16:50:05]</a>. The series concludes with a remix of Alex Jones's "turned the frogs gay" quote, which is noted as the "only self-aware moment in the entire series" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:05">[18:04:05]</a>.

### The "Gay Baby Potion" Spin-off

J Hills, ImJayStation's friend, created his own video titled "I Mixed the Baby and Gay Potion From the Dark Web and Used it on ImJayStation Insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:05">[18:41:05]</a>. The video's premise, mixing a "baby potion" with a "gay potion," highlights a further descent into nonsensical and potentially offensive content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:05">[19:13:05]</a>.

## Critique and Ethical Concerns

These videos are criticized for being "clearly meant for kids that probably shouldn't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. The primary concerns revolve around:
*   **Harmful Content for Children**: The videos expose young audiences to [[discussion_on_the_consequences_of_homophobic_content_and_representation_in_media | homophobic content]] and stereotypes, presenting being gay as something frightening or gross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:15">[03:11:15]</a>.
*   **Exploitation for Monetization**: The content is seen as a "clear money grab" to attract views and ad revenue from impressionable young audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:05">[19:48:05]</a>. J Hills' video, for instance, had five mid-roll ads in a ten-minute video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:05">[19:32:05]</a>.
*   **Clout Chasing and Ignorance**: The content is seen as a product of mixing "clout chasing with ignorance," which "can cause real pain for people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:05">[20:04:05]</a>.
*   **Disrespectful Appropriation**: The use of Kermit the Frog is considered a violation of Jim Henson's legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:05">[19:56:05]</a>.

Audience comments on these videos often express disgust, offense due to the homophobia, and concern over the realism of the fake scenario for younger viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:05">[18:12:05]</a>.

> "I understand that these videos are meant to be entertaining and that it's all in good fun but if it's at the expense of a marginalized group, maybe just don't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:05">[19:41:05]</a>.

In contrast to such content, there are numerous creators and media that depict LGBTQ+ people as "regular people" and not as part of a "spooky challenge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:05">[20:24:05]</a>.

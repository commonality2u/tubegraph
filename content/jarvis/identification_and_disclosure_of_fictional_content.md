The digital landscape has seen the emergence of "fake influencers," which are distinct from traditional influencers who might simply perform a curated version of their real lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. These "fake influencers" are literally characters written by a team of writers, pretending to be influencers but not existing in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

## Defining "Fake Influencers"

Unlike typical influencers who might present an exaggerated or untrue version of their actual lives, [[impact_of_fictional_influencers_on_audiences | fake influencers]] are fictional characters entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. They are creations, literally written by teams, and do not exist as real people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

## Distinguishing from Traditional Influencers

The speaker differentiates between classic Instagram influencers, who might make their lives appear more interesting or perfect than they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, and [[impact_of_fictional_influencers_on_audiences | fake influencers]] who are entirely made-up characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. The latter are literally written by a team of writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Fictional Influencers and Production Companies

Approximately a month before this discussion, two prominent fictional influencers were noted:
*   **Butler Darren** – A purported personal assistant to a billionaire, involved in various "hijinks" including an affair with the billionaire's girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Much Joy** – Described as the fictional daughter of the same billionaire. Her storylines include an identical twin and her grandmother stealing her boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. These videos often feature poor acting and writing, which seems to be intentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

Many of these TikTok accounts state "fictional" in their bios, though some did not initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Comments sections often play into the fictional world, suggesting some viewers are "in on it" or have been fooled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

### Forefront: A "Marvel Cinematic Universe" of Fictional People

A Vox article by Rebecca Jennings revealed that a production company named **Forefront** is behind many of these fictional influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Forefront manages 22 fictional stories and aims to build a "Marvel Cinematic Universe" of fake people and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Founded by a USC screenwriter, the company takes a "TV pilot" approach, allowing some stories to succeed and others to fail, with the goal of building a larger interconnected narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

## Disclosure Practices and Audience Confusion

A major concern is that it's often unclear to audiences whether these characters are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. While the accounts technically disclose their fictional nature, the placement of such disclosures can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Sydney

One prominent fictional character is Sydney, who claimed to work for a dating app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

#### Sydney's Storyline and Viral Content

Sydney posted a TikTok offering dating advice based on her "experience" at a dating app, which went viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. Her character arc also involves living in her sister's shadow, working a minimum wage job at a fictional dating app, and living on her sister's couch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. A major plot twist involved her discovering her sister's fiancé was cheating through her "work" at the dating app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. Later, after being kicked out by her sister, Sydney gets a new roommate: her sister's fiancé's alleged mistress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>. Due to suspension from her job, Sydney later decides to compete for Butler Darren's boss's billion-dollar estate, connecting her storyline to other fictional accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>.

#### The Issue of Disclosure

Sydney's viral TikTok did not contain a "fictional" hashtag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. While her profile bio eventually stated "100% fictional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>, this disclosure was subtle and easily missed by users scrolling through their "For You Page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Subsequent videos also varied in their disclosure, with some not including the hashtag "fictional" or sandwiching it between other hashtags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

#### Media Amplification and Misinformation

Sydney's dating advice video was picked up by online internet publications and even the New York Post, neither of which indicated that the content or the "influencer" was fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. This means a wide audience consumed advice believing it came from a real person with real experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

## Ethical Concerns and Impact on Audiences

The speaker expresses concern that this practice feels dishonest and falls into a "weird ethical gray area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. Unlike knowing that advice from "Tony Stark" is fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>, many users encountering these videos on their "For You Page" algorithms do not realize the content is not real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. The creators might be "hooking people in who think it's real at first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a>. This practice raises [[ethics_of_blending_fiction_and_reality_on_social_media | ethical concerns about the blending of fiction and reality on social media]].

## Fictional Influencers vs. Alternate Reality Games (ARGs)

When questioned about whether these are [[the_concept_of_fictional_reality_shows_in_content_houses | Alternate Reality Games (ARGs)]], the speaker states that while familiar with ARGs (like those associated with the TV show *Lost*), these fictional influencer accounts do not appear to be games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Instead, they present as a "lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## Narrative Complexity and Continued Investment

The stories created by Forefront are increasingly complex and interconnected, forming a "soap opera world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. Despite the confusing and often unbelievable plots, some viewers become invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>. The complexity of these interwoven narratives makes it difficult to follow all accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. The primary issue remains that it's easy for audiences not to realize the content is fictional due to how TikTok's algorithm works, preventing many from ever seeing the subtle disclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>.

From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Relationships manifest in various forms, from wholesome connections between a deaf cat and a vacuum cleaner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a> to adversarial ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>, and even bizarre family dynamics, such as those observed within the family of Kanye West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:44">[02:07:44]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Relationship with Kevin the Candle
> The speaker humorously claims a relationship with a candle named Kevin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. When asked to name something about him, the speaker responds that his name is Kevin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a> and is even "burned" by Kevin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## Reddit's r/relationships
The subreddit r/relationships often features [[unusual_relationship_stories | weird relationship stories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. While it can be a supportive community for people seeking advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, it's also a source of strange viral anecdotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. These stories often follow a format where "everything is perfect and normal... except this one weird thing that is always like an obvious deal-breaker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

### The Yawn-Stealing Boyfriend
One such story details a boyfriend who "gets upset when I don't give him my yawns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. For almost a year, the girlfriend considered him a "perfect angel" and wanted to spend her life with him, noting their great [[communication_and_miscommunication_in_relationships | communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. However, a few months prior, he started putting his mouth to hers when she yawned and inhaling the exhale, calling it "giving him my yawns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

Initially, this was seen as cute and silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>, but he began getting "upset, almost offended" if she yawned and didn't let him "take" it, asking if she was hiding her yawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. The boyfriend's behavior suggests a reliance on "external validation as a coping mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. The story highlights themes of [[mens_insecurity_and_controlling_behavior_in_relationships | men's insecurity and controlling behavior in relationships]].

### The Academic Philosopher Husband
Another story concerns a wife whose marriage is being "ruined" by her husband's career and academic philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. Both are academics; she is a physicist, and he is an academic philosopher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. The husband expressed displeasure that his wife had never "seriously engaged with his work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>, despite her having read philosophy classics like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

The wife found his work "completely insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>, particularly claims about physics that were "just wrong and wrong in a very embarrassing way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. He would "mansplain" things to her, like physics, which she already knew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. He has never read a physics book and admits to being bad at math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

The husband is obsessed with a 19th-century German philosopher named Hegel, keeping a framed picture of him on their nightstand and even changing his phone background from his wife's picture to Hegel's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. He uses jargon like "speculative propositions" without being able to explain them clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. Furthermore, he dismisses his wife with random German phrases despite her being a native German speaker, mispronouncing terms and claiming Hegel can only be understood in original German, a language he cannot speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. This scenario exemplifies significant [[communication_and_miscommunication_in_relationships | communication and miscommunication in relationships]].

### The Magician Restaurant Idea
A particularly unusual case involves a husband who wants to "start a restaurant for magicians and it's tearing our family apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Married for three years with two young children, the couple's relationship was already rocky due to his demanding job in the restaurant industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

The husband envisions a restaurant filled with "magical props" like levitating tables, bending cutlery, and torn and restored menus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. Meals could include a specific playing card secreted inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>, and waiters would always say "7 of hearts" if asked to think of a card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. The main purpose is for men "in on the scheme" to impress companions with seemingly spontaneous tricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

The husband had no interest in magic until four months prior, when he met a friend named Chris, described as a "magic enthusiast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. Chris convinced the husband to quit his job and use all their savings to start this restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>, leading to a huge fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>. The wife feels her husband's "fixation on Chris seems to have massively clouded his judgment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>, highlighting the dangers of [[misguided_relationship_goals_and_expectations | misguided relationship goals and expectations]] and external influence.

### Other Brief Examples
Other peculiar relationship scenarios mentioned include:
*   A wife calling her husband "Phil" during sex when his name is Elijah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
*   A husband wanting to live on a boat despite his wife's known aversion to boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   A boyfriend who won't stop looking at Reddit, even while kissing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
While some of these stories are exaggerated, they underscore the diverse and sometimes bizarre challenges that can arise in [[contestants_and_relationship_dynamics | relationship dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Many issues could be addressed through better [[communication_and_miscommunication_in_relationships | communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, open dialogue, and mutual respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.

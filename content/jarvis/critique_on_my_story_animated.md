My Story Animated is presented as a digital platform where people can share "interesting and life-changing stories" that are then turned into animated videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. However, it is primarily criticized as the latest in a series of [[critique_of_animated_story_channels | clickbait animation channels]] known for overdramatic and likely fake stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Similarities to Other Channels

My Story Animated's premise is very similar to "Actually Happened," another animation channel that has frequently appeared on trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. "Actually Happened" itself is considered a copy of "Storybooth," a legitimate channel that collaborates with children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This makes My Story Animated "a copy of a copy," but "not like a fun copy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The channel's similarity to "Actually Happened" was so strong that its "subscribe link" on the about page initially still linked to "Actually Happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Operation and Business Model

My Story Animated is described as a "money grab" and an example of a "content farm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The channel started three months after a video discussing "Actually Happened" and quickly grew to over 500,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Unlike "Actually Happened," which is run by the creators of "5-Minute Crafts," My Story Animated is an independent operation run by an Israeli app developer named Z-Boyd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This company is known for developing various apps and websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## [[critique_of_fake_animated_stories | Critique of Content]]

My Story Animated is criticized for:
*   **Absurd Clickbait** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Lazy Production Quality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>: The production quality is noted as being even lower than "Actually Happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Animations often use a "library or toolkit" rather than being drawn frame-by-frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   **Fake or Stolen Stories** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>: It is more likely that stories are made up or stolen verbatim from platforms like Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Unrelatable Characters** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>: Most stories feature characters who "definitely don't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Fictional Police Reports and Morals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>: The videos often include summaries of fake police statements at the end to try and make the stories seem real, even though police would not release such statements to random YouTube channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. They also attempt to provide morals or lessons, often poorly executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### Examples of Content

*   **"I was obsessed with our neighbors Ferrari so I stole it"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
*   **"I am too pretty"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
*   **"I'm the richest girl in school and it's embarrassing"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

#### "I broke up with my girlfriend because of potatoes"

This story, supposedly submitted by a kid, was found to be strikingly similar to a post on the "Today I F***ed Up" subreddit from three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This highlights the [[plagiarism_in_animated_stories | plagiarism]] prevalent in these channels.

#### "I was too innocent when I got into the top secret vampire society"

This story features Sarah, who believes she has the traits to become a vampire (pale skin, pointy teeth, garlic allergy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. She joins a "top-secret vampire society" only to find it's a cult run by a gang, who are then arrested by the police after her parents arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The story's internal logic is questioned, particularly the idea of a "vampire society" and its "scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

#### "I told the truth to the wrong person and it ruined my life"

This video tells the story of Sheila, who talks too much. Examples include insulting a birthday girl at a "children's party" by saying her hat looked like a nest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, and almost revealing the location of a hidden house key to a mailman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The main plot involves Sheila creating a fake Instagram account, photoshopping herself into photos of a male classmate, blurring her face, and adding "sweet captions" to cause his breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. She then confides in a new friend who turns out to be a "double agent," revealing Sheila's actions to the entire class and leading to her switching schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The "moral" is that there's a difference between being truthful and tactless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, which is ironic given Sheila's manipulative actions.

#### "I'm the richest person in my school and it's embarrassing"

Jessica, the protagonist, is "stinking rich" and embarrassed by it, wanting to fit in at her new school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. She used to be dropped off at her old school by helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. The school bus doesn't come to her house because the school "assumed it was some kind of fancy hotel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Word quickly spreads about her wealth, leading to bullying. She confronts the bullies, and the problem is resolved when she puts up a poster saying she's "a normal kid" despite being wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. The bullies then apologize, saying they were "just jealous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## Overall Assessment

My Story Animated represents a common trend of "content farms" that identify a market (in this case, animated story channels) and then produce a large volume of low-quality content to generate revenue through advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. The creators acknowledge the challenge of combating such pervasive content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

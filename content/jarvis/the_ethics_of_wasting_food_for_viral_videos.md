This article explores the phenomenon of creating highly sensational and often disgusting food-related content for social media, primarily for the purpose of generating outrage, clicks, and financial gain. It specifically highlights content created by a personality known as "the toilet lady" (Anna Rothfuss) and its connection to [[influence_of_rick_lax_on_food_videos | Rick Lax]]'s production umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

## Background: The "Toilet Lady" and Rick Lax

This topic is a follow-up to a previous discussion about "wasting food for clout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, which uncovered that the source of such videos is often [[influence_of_rick_lax_on_food_videos | Rick Lax]], known as "the big ol Facebook magician man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. A particular trend that gained traction involves a woman who frequently makes food in her toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, also known as Anna Rothfuss or "the Anna show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. These "countertop people" and "toilet lady" videos are directly connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and are produced under the "magic show" brand, founded by [[influence_of_rick_lax_on_food_videos | Rick Lax]] on Snapchat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

!!! warning "Content Warning"
The video content discussed is described as "not click bait, but not in a good way" and "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Toilet-Based "Food Hacks"

Anna Rothfuss is notorious for using a toilet as a vessel for preparing various food and drink items:

### DIY Punch Trick
A DIY punch trick involves putting ice and Neapolitan ice cream into a toilet bowl, followed by Hawaiian Punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The toilet used for this appears stained and "bacterial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The sheer volume of liquid poured into the toilet raises questions about how it was measured to avoid overflowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Despite claims of cleaning the toilet, the imagery and potential for bacteria remain off-putting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Hair Washing in the Toilet
Beyond food, Anna also features a "hair hack" where hair is washed in the toilet bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Shampoo is poured into the toilet tank, allowing it to mix with the water that comes out when flushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This stunt is also presented as part of the "magic show" content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### The Toilet Milkshake
A "dessert" video showcases the creation of a milkshake in the toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This involves first clogging the toilet with a "burrito sandbag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, then adding chocolate sauce, whipped cream, gallons of milk, and sprinkles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The process includes adding whipped cream "if you want it extra creamy just because there's a little bit of water mixed in there" â€“ referring to toilet water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. The final product is expected to be consumed with multiple straws directly from the toilet bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Other Questionable "Food Hacks"

Anna Rothfuss's content extends beyond toilets to include other bizarre and unappetizing food preparations:

### Ground Beef and Velveeta Biscuit
One example is a "viral" hack involving ground beef and Velveeta cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. The process includes squeezing out raw ground beef, rolling it with a rolling pin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, molding Velveeta cheese "just like clay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, wrapping the beef around it, and baking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. The resulting dish is described as "truly vile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

## The Motivation: Outrage and Clout

The primary motivation behind these extreme and wasteful food videos is to generate "outrage clicks and views" and "tons of money from the outrage views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Content creators "faking social media content for virality and clout" has been a consistent strategy since the beginning of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

There is no evidence to support alternative theories, such as a fetish aspect to these videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>; the most "obvious thing" is the financial incentive gained from shocking an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. As an example, a video featuring spaghetti garnered news attention due to public outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. These videos are "just for content" and not meant to be practical or replicable by the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Broader Implications

While the content creators demonstrate "sheer force of will to get herself to do these things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>, the ethical concerns primarily revolve around the waste of food and the perpetuation of bizarre or problematic ideas.

### Food Waste
A significant ethical concern is the large-scale "wasting food in the process" of creating these viral hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. This deliberate waste is seen as "upsetting for sure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

### [[The Ethics of Staging Prank Videos | Staged Prank Videos]]
Anna Rothfuss also creates [[the_ethics_of_pranking | prank videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, such as a Tinder date prank that perpetuates "weird ideas about beauty and sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. While these pranks may not waste food, they raise different ethical questions about manipulation and social messaging.

## Conclusion
The creation of outlandish "food hacks" in toilets and other unsanitary methods, driven by the pursuit of virality and financial gain, raises significant ethical concerns. The primary issue is the deliberate and often large-scale waste of food for entertainment purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. These videos leverage disgust and outrage for views, rather than offering genuine utility or entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

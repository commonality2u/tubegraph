Modern dating culture is significantly influenced by social media, with individuals often leveraging platforms and technology to navigate relationships and personal interactions. This influence extends from the public [[Portrayal of relationships on social media|portrayal of relationships on social media]] to the use of technology for personal gain, sometimes blurring ethical boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Exploitative Tech "Hacks" in Relationships

Some individuals, like software engineer and entrepreneur Ethan Kaiser, gain notoriety by sharing "hacks" that manipulate social media and dating apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. One such "hack" involved using a girlfriend's Wi-Fi password to access the router and remotely check connected devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This allowed him to determine if other devices had been connected or if his girlfriend's device was not at home when she claimed to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

This behavior is criticized as "abusive behavior," "stalking," and a "betrayal of trust and privacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It is considered as invasive as going through someone's phone, despite the use of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The perception that such tech-based actions are "magic" or simply a "joke" often leads people to overlook their problematic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## The Rebound App: Tracking Relationships and Breakups

Ethan Kaiser developed an app called "Rebound" that tracks relationships on Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The app monitors whether individuals in popular "soulmate" TikTok videos continue to follow each other on Instagram, sending a push notification if they unfollow, indicating a breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Kaiser stated that "nearly 30 percent" of those who broke up responded to his direct messages (DMs) sent minutes after their relationships ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This approach is critiqued as being manipulative, using the app to find vulnerable people for personal outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The app's premise to "expose all the fake soulmate relationships on TikTok" is seen as cynical and unnecessary, as relationship breakups are a common reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This app's functionality is a clear example of [[Analysis of social media influencer behavior|influencer behavior]] impacting perceptions of relationships and could contribute to [[Effects of social media on relationships|negative effects on social media relationships]].

## Deception for Social Status and Dating

Another application developed by Kaiser was designed to simulate an Instagram Live stream with thousands of viewers, allowing him to appear famous and gain special treatment in real-life social settings, such as getting into sold-out clubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This practice of "lying about your identity" is seen as a poor foundation for any new relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. The fabricated engagement, including pre-programmed chat messages that ask "Have you ever heard of Ethan Kaiser?" and "I hear he's a great creator," highlights the deceptive nature of this pursuit of clout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This practice relates to [[Impact of social media on public perception of success|how social media influences public perception of success]].

## AI for Dating Apps: The Patrick Bateman Approach

For dating, Kaiser created an app to reverse-engineer major dating apps, store nearly 50,000 profiles, and then automatically swipe right on all of them, yielding around 5,000 matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. To communicate with these matches, he built an artificial intelligence (AI) based on the personalities of "Patrick Bateman from American Psycho and James Bond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. The AI uses movie quotes from these characters to respond to messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

This method is deemed ethically questionable because it involves lying to potential partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. The use of a serial killer's persona for dating raises concerns about the ethical implications of using AI and automation in personal interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. While dating is challenging, this approach is criticized for being "ethically wrong" and potentially leading to uncomfortable situations if the true nature of the interaction is revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. This highlights a significant [[Critique of online relationship advice|criticism of the show's approach to dating]] and modern online behaviors.

The general sentiment expressed is that such methods are "goofy," "clownish," and "morally gray at best," emphasizing that people often overlook ethical concerns when promised desirable outcomes like finding love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.

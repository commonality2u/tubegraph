Digital marketing has evolved, with brands increasingly engaging in unusual antics across various social media platforms to capture attention and promote themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Ubiquity of Brands on Social Media

Brands are an inescapable presence on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. When asked on Twitter for examples of "nonsense brands have been up to," numerous brands responded directly, seeking inclusion in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This highlights their desire for free advertising and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Brands like Velveeta Cheese ("eat liquid gold official twitter feed of liquid gold") and UNO have engaged with the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Zaxby's was also noted for being "super thirsty" for clout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## The Evolution of Brand Persona

A significant [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing push]] aimed to turn brands into people, which has largely succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Brands now commonly act like real individuals with specific personality traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, such as MoonPie appearing as a "stoner" or SunnyD being "sad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This has led to the expectation that brands will be absurd and weird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### "Brands Are Just Like Us"

Many [[consumer_behavior_and_brand_interactions_on_social_media | brand interactions]] and content aim to be relatable:
*   **Wendy's Fan Fiction**: Wendy's created a Wattpad account, publishing stories like "The Lemonade Charade" and "The Forbidden Fruit Tea," which contain dramatic narratives about relationships and professional setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. These stories attempt to empathize with working people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Relatable Content**: Bagel Bites tweets often don't even mention their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Gaming Together**: Brands play popular games like "Among Us" with each other, such as SunnyD, Totino's, Bugles, Gushers, Chex Mix, and Kids Foot Locker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Emotional Support**: When McDonald's posted about being "depressed," other brands like Fall Guys responded with support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Brand-on-Brand Criticism**: Brands even engage in [[intercompany_rivalry_and_internet_engagement_strategies | criticism]] of how other brands use social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Direct Engagement**: The Slim Jim account directly messaged a content creator to praise their YouTube video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, leading to a strange conversation with a "beef snack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Jake from State Farm also followed the creator after they dressed as him for Halloween <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

## Seeking Attention and Engagement: Brand Antics

Brands employ ridiculous stunts to gain attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>:
*   **Celebrity Transformations**: McDonald's turned Travis Scott into a Happy Meal and J Balvin into a chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Physical Manifestations of Memes**: Xbox took the meme that its console looked like a fridge and created a real Xbox fridge, which was given to Snoop Dogg and iJustine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This was done purely to generate discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Products**: KFC, whose name no longer stands for "Kentucky Fried Chicken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, developed a dating simulator featuring Colonel Sanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. They also announced the creation of a KFC-branded gaming console with a "chicken chamber" designed to warm chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## The Human Element in Brand Social Media

Behind these brand accounts are human beings trying to make a living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Their jobs are often undervalued despite the content they create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Some companies, like GameStop, have reportedly tried to force employees to create TikToks to become "TikTok famous" and drive store traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This practice is criticized as attempting to exploit employee creativity for free labor, without compensating them at the level of "TikTok stars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This touches upon [[social_media_industry_and_job_roles | job roles]] within the [[behind_the_scenes_of_social_media_management_for_brands | social media industry]].

## The Self-Perpetuating Cycle of Brand Engagement

Brands engage in bizarre actions, which people then discuss, leading to increased brand awareness and further revenue, thus perpetuating the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The content created by brands is often more engaging than their actual products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Content creators, by discussing these brand antics, inadvertently provide free advertising, creating a strange dynamic where their own income often relies on similar ad-related structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | impact of social media engagements]] by brands. There are even instances where brands can "break your heart," like a promise of a hat from a brand's social media manager that never materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

[[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] are a prominent feature of the BuzzFeed website, described as an "amazing website" that blends "horrific" news with "cute" trending content, with quizzes conveniently placed next to news articles, implying equal importance [01:15:00].

## History and Early Appeal
The earliest encounter with [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] by some users was approximately "10 years ago" in Facebook feeds, providing a diversion from activities like tending to virtual farms on Farmville or viewing friends' party photos [01:17:00]. Initially, these quizzes were considered "very pointless" but "straightforward," asking questions such as "what Harry Potter character are you" [02:38:00]. They offered simple, often self-validating entertainment, purporting to tell users "how attractive I am" or "what kind of pirate I was" [02:29:00].

## Evolution and Modern Quizzes
Over time, [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] have evolved to become "really Weird and Specific" [02:45:00]. Many now require users to complete tasks to receive information they likely already know [02:48:00].

Examples of the peculiar nature of modern quizzes include:
*   **Transactional Quizzes:** "Shop at Victoria's Secret and we'll give you an Ariana Grande song to listen to" [02:55:00]. This is considered an unfair trade, as shopping at Victoria's Secret can be time-consuming due to variety, while an Ariana Grande song is short and easily accessible via streaming services without leaving home [03:05:00].
*   **Challenging Intelligence:** Quizzes like "We bet you haven't tried at least half of the cheeses on this list" are seen as obvious statements, as there are many cheeses available [03:52:00].
*   **Frightening Accuracy Claims:** "Plan a movie night and we'll guess your age with Frightening Accuracy" creates an unsettling premise [04:20:00]. The questions within such quizzes can also be nonsensical, such as suggesting inviting a "Sports team" to a movie night [04:40:00].
*   **Quizzes that "Give Up":** Some titles reflect a lack of confidence, like "It'll be a miracle if we can guess your age based on your dessert preferences," implying the quiz developers anticipate failure [05:25:00].
*   **Quizzes with Obvious Premise:** The quiz "If you have a lot of random knowledge, this quiz will be easy for you" is criticized for stating the obvious, as this applies to any quiz [05:37:00].

### The "Love Poo" Quiz
A notable example highlighting the bizarre nature of some [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] is "This yes or no quiz will tell us if you love poo" [05:53:00]. This particular quiz was written by "BuzzFeed staff" [07:17:00] and contains multiple questions and disturbing stock photos, despite the subject matter not seemingly requiring a multi-question quiz [06:54:00].

Examples of questions from the "Love Poo" quiz include:
*   "Do you feel sad when you can't go?" [07:01:00]
*   "Do you ever feel genuinely happy when you have a big poo?" [07:38:00]
*   "Do you ever look back at who you've just done and think wow?" [08:22:00]
*   "Do you often feel lighter when you go for a poo?" [08:47:00]
*   "Do you ever text or send selfies while you poo?" [09:02:00]
*   "Do you ever announce that you're going for a shit in front of a group of people?" [10:28:00]
*   "Do you talk to your friends about pooping?" [10:44:00]
*   "Do you have a daily regimen that you enjoy sticking to and documenting?" [11:01:00]
*   "Do you own anything poop themed?" [11:32:00]

The quiz features stock photos with specific, often humorous, titles such as "Smiling young man taking selfie with cell phone while defecating in his bathroom" [09:19:00] and "Young, dark haired man with handheld game or cell phone sitting on toilet with pants around ankles" [09:38:00]. The keywords for these photos include "shit," "bathroom," "poo," and "selfie" [09:54:00].

## Business Model and Staffing
The content, referred to as "Buzz Feedâ„¢," is produced by "quiz callers" who work for free, often described as "bored college student[s]" [00:51:00]. This free labor is stated as the "only way we stay in business" [00:59:00]. Despite the trivial nature of some quizzes, the staff who create them are generally regarded as "great person[s]" who are "just like having fun," potentially creating the quizzes as "an inside joke" [07:21:00].

## Overall Impact
While some content creators originally intended to discuss more substantive issues like BuzzFeed's layoffs of writing staff or how a significant portion of their quiz traffic came from a single college student, the prevalence of unusual quizzes can divert attention to less serious topics [01:16:00]. The sheer absurdity of some quizzes, such as the "love poo" quiz, highlights a critique of [[buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed's quiz]] content [05:42:00].

The social media platform [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_TikTok | TikTok]] has become a hub for various viral trends, including alleged mermaid sightings, often presented in the form of grainy videos and mysterious audio clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This content frequently prompts viewers to question the existence of these mythical creatures, while also being used as a platform to raise awareness for ocean conservation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Prominent TikTokers and Content
One notable figure in the [[phoebe_daniels_and_mermaid_tiktok_content | mermaid TikTok content]] space is [[phoebe_daniels_and_mermaid_tiktok_content | Phoebe Daniels]], known on the platform as @phebed_ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. As an Australian mermaid, she has garnered 1.2 million followers by posting videos that purport to show evidence of mermaids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Her videos often feature blurry footage of alleged "siren tails" or other sea creatures, presented with open-ended questions like "What do you think?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Her content is heavily tagged with various terms, including #mermaids, #mermaid, #sea creature, #washed up, #vampire, and #alien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Another type of content involves reactions to supposed "siren songs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. One male TikToker frequently duets videos featuring high-pitched sounds in the ocean, arguing that they are not dolphins or whales, but sirens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. These videos are often staged, with the TikToker reacting dramatically to the sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## [[debunking_mermaid_videos_and_conspiracy_theories | Debunking Mermaid Videos and Conspiracy Theories]]
Despite the claims, many of the videos shared as evidence of mermaids face significant skepticism and [[debunking_mermaid_videos_and_conspiracy_theories | debunking mermaid videos and conspiracy theories]] within the [[TikTok community dynamics and meme culture | TikTok community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Common criticisms include:
*   **Blurry or Staged Footage** Many alleged sightings are too blurry to clearly identify anything, or they appear to be staged, possibly using costumes or CGI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Known Hoaxes/Mockumentaries** Some "mermaid remains" videos are identified as originating from *Mermaid: The Body Found*, a docufiction mockumentary by Animal Planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. When [[phoebe_daniels_and_mermaid_tiktok_content | Phoebe Daniels]] was called out for using footage from this known source, some viewers accused her of "feeding" fake news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Misidentified Animal Sounds** The supposed "siren songs" are often indistinguishable from the sounds of known marine animals like dolphins or whales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Critics highlight the poor acting and staged nature of TikTokers reacting to these sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Account Bans and "Truth"** Some TikTokers claim their accounts are banned because "the truth was getting out to too many people," implying a conspiracy to suppress information about mermaids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This narrative suggests that "people at the TikTok" don't want users to know about siren songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

## Ocean Conservation Connection
Despite the fantastical nature of the content, the discussion of mermaids on [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_TikTok | TikTok]] is sometimes framed as a creative way to raise awareness for genuine environmental causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The video discussing these sightings, for instance, is sponsored by the ocean and promotes the Team Seas initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This initiative, started by Mr. Beast and Mark Rober, aims to raise 30 million dollars and remove 30 million pounds of waste from the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Viewers are encouraged to donate to Teamseas.org, with every dollar removing one pound of waste, emphasizing that protecting the ocean is crucial, especially as it is the "mermaids' home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

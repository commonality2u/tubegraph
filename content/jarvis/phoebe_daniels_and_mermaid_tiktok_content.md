Phoebe Daniels, known as `phebed_` on [[mermaid_sightings_and_tiktok | TikTok]], is an Australian content creator who has garnered 1.2 million followers by posting alleged [[mermaid_sightings_and_tiktok | mermaid sightings and TikTok]] content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Her content often features blurry or unclear videos that she suggests might depict mermaids or other unknown sea creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Content Format and Audience Interaction

Daniels' [[tiktok_pranks_and_trends | TikTok]] videos frequently showcase alleged sightings, often asking her audience "What do you think?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>, inviting viewers to interpret the footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. She uses hashtags such as `#mermaids`, `#mermaid`, `#seacreature`, `#washedup`, and surprisingly, `#vampire` and `#alien` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>, suggesting a broad interest in the unknown.

The speaker notes that Daniels' videos often feel like "America's Funniest Home Videos for like mermaid spotting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>, characterized by her recurring presence and questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

## Debunking Alleged Sightings

Despite the content's focus on mermaids, the speaker expresses skepticism regarding the authenticity of the videos, suggesting they could be individuals in costumes, CGI, or staged events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

A notable instance involves a video shared by Daniels depicting "mermaid remains" allegedly found in the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This footage was identified by a commenter as being from a mockumentary titled *Mermaid: The Body Found* by Animal Planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. When confronted, Daniels reportedly acknowledged knowing about the mockumentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. This led to accusations from her audience of purposefully sharing fake content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>, highlighting the blurred lines between speculation and [[debunking_mermaid_videos_and_conspiracy_theories | conspiracy theories]] on the platform.

### Siren Song Videos

Another recurring type of content involves videos featuring alleged "siren" sounds heard in the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. One TikToker frequently duets these videos, attempting to convince viewers that the sounds are not from dolphins or whales but from sirens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. The speaker finds these videos poorly acted and staged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>, noting that the TikToker often records themselves biding time, waiting for the "siren" sound to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. This content contributes to the broader [[tiktok_community_dynamics_and_meme_culture | TikTok community dynamics and meme culture]] around mysterious phenomena.

The speaker also highlights the [[debunking_mermaid_videos_and_conspiracy_theories | conspiracy theory]] aspect, noting that some users believe accounts posting about mermaids or sirens are banned because "they don't want us to know something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>.

## Ocean Protection Initiative

The video is sponsored by Team Seas, an initiative by Mr. Beast and Mark Rober aimed at raising 30 million dollars to remove 30 million pounds of waste from the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The speaker encourages viewers to donate to Team Seas, tying the excitement around mermaids and the ocean to the importance of protecting marine environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. It is suggested that cleaning the ocean might even encourage sirens and mermaids to interact with humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.

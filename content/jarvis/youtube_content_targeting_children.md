The YouTube channel 123 Go!, which gained 1.6 million subscribers since February, is noted for its trending content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Described as a copy of "5 Minute Crafts" combined with "Troom Troom," it features peculiar life hacks and pranks with characters and voiceovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This combination results in one of the strangest and most pointless YouTube channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Unrelatable "Relatable Situations"
A video titled "Relatable situations anybody can recognize" was number one on trending, yet its content was deemed the most unrelatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The scenarios presented, such as a "piping mishap" or a "broken nail," are framed as everyday issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. However, the depictions often lean into the uncanny, making viewers uncomfortable due to things not quite fitting as they should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Examples of unrelatable scenarios include:
*   A woman reacting to a face-sized spider by packing a suitcase to stay at a hotel for days, rather than calling the fire department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   A character lamenting a sink full of dirty dishes they haven't seen in weeks, only to selectively wash one mug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   A character struggling to pick up a dropped coffee pod with false nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   A character doing push-ups to "warm up muscles" before carrying groceries from an Enterprise rental car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

The channel's narrator also shifts between addressing the character and speaking about them, adding to the bizarre nature of the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## [[the_issue_of_inappropriate_childrens_content_on_youtube | Content Appropriateness and Target Audience]]
Despite some viewers suggesting the videos are for children, particularly due to their "DIY school pranks" and "easy pranks for back to school" content strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, there's significant debate regarding the true [[youtube_channel_demographics | YouTube channel demographics]] and [[age_restrictions_on_youtube | age restrictions on YouTube]] for these videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Some examples raise questions about the suitability of the content for a younger audience:
*   **Use of Dangerous Tools** One "prank" involves cutting Play-Doh with an X-Acto knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, leading to the sarcastic remark that the videos are "for kids with box cutters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This highlights potential [[youtube_exploitation_tactics | exploitation of preteens for monetization on YouTube]] due to hazardous activities.
*   **Questionable Prank Ingredients** Another prank involves mixing Sprite, soy sauce, and Coke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. The resulting mixture is described as smelling like "death" and being "rank as all hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Scenarios for Children** Scenarios such as a child skipping town, grabbing an adult-sized suitcase to flee a bug, and living alone in an apartment are not relatable for a typical child audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Ambiguous Character Ages** The age of the characters is often questioned, with some appearing to be adults in situations that might be associated with school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. For instance, a school lunch hall scene features a wooden pepper grinder, which is considered too ornate for a typical school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
*   **"Learning About Pranks"** The channel explicitly states viewers will "love learning about pranks," further emphasizing the content's focus on practical jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

The content's bizarre and often nonsensical nature, combined with its seemingly misplaced target audience, raises concerns about [[content_moderation_on_youtube | content moderation on YouTube]] and the [[consequences_of_coppa_on_youtube_content | consequences of COPPA on YouTube content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The channels' [[youtube_algorithm_and_channel_content_strategy | YouTube algorithm and channel content strategy]], which includes "keyword stuffing" to appear in searches for "easy pranks for back to school," suggests a deliberate attempt to capture a specific demographic, even if the content itself doesn't align with that group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

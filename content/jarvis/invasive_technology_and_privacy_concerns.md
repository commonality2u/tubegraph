Ethan Kaiser, a software engineer and entrepreneur, has gained popularity on TikTok by posting viral videos about "hacking social media and dating apps" to achieve fame and find love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. However, his methods raise significant concerns regarding privacy, ethics, and deceptive practices.

## Ethical Concerns in "Tech Hacks"

The core issue with Kaiser's "tech hacks" lies in their ethically questionable nature, often involving a betrayal of trust and invasion of [[technology_and_privacy_concerns_in_smart_house | privacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>. The speaker argues that simply using technology does not make an invasive act any less problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

### Wi-Fi Monitoring
One "hack" involves asking a girlfriend for her Wi-Fi password and then using access to the router to remotely check what other devices have connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. This allows the user to determine who has been in the home or if the partner is lying about their whereabouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. The speaker vehemently condemns this, stating it is "not a tech hack, it's abusive behavior, it's stalking, it's a betrayal of trust and [[technology_and_privacy_concerns_in_smart_house | privacy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

### The Rebound App
Kaiser developed an app called "Rebound" that tracks relationships by monitoring whether people on Instagram follow each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. When a couple unfollows each other, indicating a breakup, the app sends a push notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Kaiser then claims he would "slide into their DMs" minutes after they broke up, with nearly 30% responding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. The speaker views this as "creepy and stalkerish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:03">[11:11:03]</a> and questions the intent behind creating such an app to target vulnerable individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

### Simulating Fame with a Fake IG Live App
Kaiser created an app that simulates an Instagram Live stream with thousands of fake viewers and programmed chat messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. He used this to pretend to be famous and gain special treatment, such as entry into a sold-out club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. The speaker criticizes this as a form of social engineering and deception, highlighting the sadness of needing to lie about one's identity to gain approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:33">[11:52:33]</a>.

### Dating App AI and [[Privacy and data protection in mobile gaming | Data Protection]]
Perhaps the most concerning "hack" involves dating apps. Kaiser "reverse engineered all the major dating apps and stored 49,000 profiles in a database," including full names and phone numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>. He then programmed an AI, based on the personalities of Patrick Bateman from *American Psycho* and James Bond, to swipe right on all profiles and manage conversations with 5,000 matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>.

> [23:01:03] "It just feels ethically wrong to me. I feel like if these women were aware of what was going on, obviously they wouldn't consent to it."

The speaker highlights the severe [[technology_and_privacy_concerns_in_smart_house | privacy]] implications of harvesting user data, calling it a "careless mistake" to expose personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. The use of an AI to impersonate a human and communicate using serial killer quotes is described as "dystopian and kind of sad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>, and raises questions about consent and genuine interaction in dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>.

### The Broader Impact
The speaker emphasizes that while dating is difficult, these manipulative and invasive methods are not the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>. The overall sentiment is captured by the adage:

> [22:56:00] "Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. It just feels ethically wrong to me."

Ultimately, these "hacks" are characterized as "goofy," "clownish," and "morally gray at best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>, serving as examples of how the [[importance_of_maintaining_ethical_boundaries_in_tech_innovation | ethics of technology]] can be overlooked when promising desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:00">[25:16:00]</a>.

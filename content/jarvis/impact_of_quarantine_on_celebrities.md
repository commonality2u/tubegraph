The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent self-isolation measures had a notable impact on celebrities, forcing many to adapt to new ways of life and work, often in the public eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. This unique situation offered a distinct [[perspective_on_celebrity_culture_during_pandemic | perspective on celebrity culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

## Initial Adjustments and Public Reception

Early in the pandemic, some celebrities drew criticism for their perceived lack of empathy or awareness of the general public's struggles:
*   **Tom Brady**, a football player, had to relocate from his New England mansion to a Florida mansion after getting a new job, which he found problematic due to its proximity to the beach and being able to see "common folk" from his backyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **Justin Bieber** sparked controversy during an Instagram Live call with Kendall Jenner when he stated he couldn't feel "too bad" about his wealth because he "worked for what he has" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This comment led to an apology, though he was defended by Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs, who stated, "the Lord speaks through him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Vanessa Hudgens** lamented not being able to attend Coachella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

These instances highlight a public perception of [[tonedeafness_of_celebrities_during_crises | tone-deafness of celebrities during crises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

## Adapting to Quarantine: Two Categories

Celebrities largely fell into two categories regarding their response to quarantine: those who couldn't work and those who attempted to work from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

### Celebrities Not Working or Engaging in Hobbies
Many celebrities, unable to continue their usual work, resorted to social media posts from their large homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

#### The "Imagine" Video
**Gal Gadot** organized a video featuring numerous celebrities singing John Lennon's "Imagine" from their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. The video, released on day six of quarantine, was widely criticized for its poor singing, awkwardness, and [[tonedeafness_of_celebrities_during_cris | social tone-deafness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

The intent was to evoke the spirit of an Italian man playing the trumpet from his balcony for his community during lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. However, the celebrity version was seen as a poor recreation, lacking the trumpet player's musical talent and genuine community spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Critics noted that the Italian musician's act was powerful because he was not seeking attention, but rather trying to cheer up his community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

#### Other Examples of Quarantine Activities
*   **Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas** posted TikToks showcasing their completed Harry Potter Lego sets with no additional context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. They also shared cooking videos on Instagram Live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
*   **Kristin Chenoweth** created repetitive TikToks using a single joke involving a high note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
*   **Jack Black** performed a dance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
*   **Jake Gyllenhaal** took off his shirt for an unclear reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.
*   **Matthew McConaughey** attempted to reassure the public, though his demeanor suggested fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

### Celebrities Attempting to Work from Home
Many celebrities with television shows decided to try working from home, aiming to [[celebrities_trying_to_entertain_from_home | recreate television magic remotely]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

#### Talk Show Hosts
*   **Ellen DeGeneres** faced criticism for comparing lockdown to "being in jail" from her mansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Reports also emerged that her employees were concerned about pay while she hired an outside company to film her show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.
*   **John Oliver** hosted his show from what appeared to be the afterlife, maintaining an engaging presence despite the lack of a studio audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.
*   **Seth Meyers** recorded "A Closer Look" segments from an echoey room, showcasing poor camera quality despite being part of NBC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.
*   **Trevor Noah** adopted a YouTube-like editing style and featured other comedians, showcasing better production quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.

#### Jimmy Fallon's "At Home Edition"
Jimmy Fallon's "The Tonight Show: At Home Edition" was particularly highlighted for its struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.
*   **Forced Family Content**: Fallon's attempts to open his show with his "adorable daughters" appeared forced, with his kids looking miserable and seemingly used for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. There were awkward moments where his children's quiet responses were inaudible, suggesting poor editing and an assumption the audience would find it interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.
*   **Low Energy and Rambling**: The show was criticized for its low energy, rambling segments, and choppy editing, which drew attention to cuts without improving flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>.
*   **Awkward Monologue Jokes**: Fallon's monologue jokes were deemed unfunny, poorly delivered, and lacking conviction, often deflating at the punchline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>.
*   **Visual Gimmicks**: The presence of a "giant slide" in his background was seen as a sign of his unhappiness rather than a fun element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>.

## Positive Examples and General Observations

Despite the mixed results, some celebrities were praised for their efforts:
*   **John Krasinski** was lauded for his "Some Good News" videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>.
*   **Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon** released a podcast, "Stayin' In," to help people cope with isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.
*   **Cardi B** was recognized for her engaging commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>.

The quarantine period underscored the difference between traditional media personalities and internet creators, who are often self-produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>. Ultimately, the unusual circumstances offered a "humanizing view of celebrity," revealing their "innate human fallibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>. This period served as a reminder that "celebrities are just like us (kind of)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.

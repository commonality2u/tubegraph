YouTube implements age restrictions to filter content that may not be suitable for all audiences, particularly children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. When a video is age-restricted, viewers are prompted to confirm their age before watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. However, this system relies on users truthfully providing their age, which can be circumvented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Morgz's "THE BEST SCARE PRANK ON FAMILY!"

The YouTube creator Morgz, who has over 11 million subscribers, primarily targets [[youtube_content_targeting_children | children]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. His audience demographics were evident at "MorgzFest," an event where adults over 18 had to be accompanied by a child to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

In a video titled "THE BEST SCARE PRANK ON FAMILY!" posted in late 2019, Morgz created content that led to YouTube applying an age restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. The video's thumbnail, which depicted Morgz "not alive" in a bathtub filled with a "famously red" body fluid, was deemed "f***ing horrifying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. The actual video content included Morgz staging a gruesome scene in a bathroom, making it appear as though he had been brutally attacked, described as a "bloodbath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. This content was considered "gruesome" and "triggering," especially given the blend of "cartoon and reality" often present in his videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>.

### Impact of Age Restriction on Morgz's Audience
Due to Morgz's primary audience being young children, the age restriction meant that his typical viewers would not be able to watch the video unless they lied about their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. The video also lacked explicit disclaimers like "Don't try this at home," which is a concern for an impressionable young audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>. The content was described as "scarring" even for an adult viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Potential Harm to Young Viewers
> The video's content, while featuring slapstick humor, escalated into deeply disturbing themes, particularly the graphic depiction of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>. Such content, even when age-restricted, raises [[the_issue_of_inappropriate_childrens_content_on_youtube | concerns about the effectiveness of content moderation]] and the potential for [[exploitation_of_preteens_for_monetization_on_youtube | psychological impact on young viewers]] who may bypass restrictions or be exposed indirectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>.

Netflix's dating show *Too Hot To Handle* features a cast of "horny" singles who are prevented from physical intimacy to foster deeper connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The show selected ten initially "horniest people on planet earth" from three thousand auditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The show's premise suggests its [[Contestants and relationship dynamics | contestants]] are commitment-phobic and only care about sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The show is heavily criticized for its [[Critique of The Bachelor as a television show | production choices]] and the perceived artificiality of its [[Contestants and relationship dynamics | contestants]]' characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

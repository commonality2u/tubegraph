Ethan Kaiser, described as "TikTok's titan of toxic tech," is a software engineer and entrepreneur who creates viral videos demonstrating how he "hacks" social media and dating apps to achieve fame and find love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. His methods often raise significant ethical concerns regarding privacy, consent, and deceptive practices.

## Invasion of Privacy and Stalking

One of Kaiser's early demonstrations involves using a Wi-Fi password obtained from a girlfriend to remotely check connected devices on her router <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This allows him to determine if she is at home or if another device has come online, potentially indicating she is lying or seeing someone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Critics argue that this is not a "tech hack" but rather abusive behavior, stalking, and a betrayal of trust and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It is considered equivalent to going through someone's phone, with technology making it no less invasive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Such actions, though sometimes played off as a joke due to a perception of "tech is magic," are deemed creepy and weird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Deception for Social Gain

Kaiser developed an app called "Rebound" that tracks relationships on Instagram by monitoring whether users follow each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. His stated purpose for this app was to disprove the "soulmate" trend on TikTok by tracking how many relationships from viral videos remained together after six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The app sends a push notification when couples unfollow each other, indicating a breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. He then used this information to "slide into their DMs" minutes after they broke up, with nearly 30% responding to his messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

This behavior is seen as problematic, potentially exploiting vulnerable individuals immediately after a breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The practice of building an app to expose "fake soulmate relationships" is perceived by some as creepy and stalkerish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Another instance of social manipulation involves an app designed to simulate a highly popular Instagram Live stream, displaying thousands of fake viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Kaiser used this app to gain special treatment, such as entry into a sold-out club, by implying his fabricated fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. The app's simulated chat messages, which ask questions like "who is your favorite creator" and praise "Ethan Kaiser," reveal the programmed and artificial nature of the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This tactic of [[Ethics of blending fiction and reality on social media | blending fiction and reality]] and using [[tactics_and_implications_of_creating_fake_online_personas | fake online personas]] or appearances to gain social advantage is seen as a form of [[the_use_of_social_engineering_in_cybersecurity_breaches | social engineering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. It is criticized as lying about one's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> and a "sad thing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

## Automating Dating and Deception

Kaiser also created an advanced dating app manipulation system:
*   He reverse-engineered major dating apps and stored 49,000 profiles in a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This process included displaying full names and phone numbers, raising significant privacy concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   He then programmed a script to automatically swipe right on all 50,000 profiles, resulting in about 5,000 matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   To converse with these 5,000 matches, he built an artificial intelligence (AI) based on the personalities of Patrick Bateman from *American Psycho* and James Bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

The use of an AI impersonating fictional characters, especially a serial killer, to interact with real people on dating apps is highly criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. This raises questions about whether the "joke" is that people are unknowingly interacting with a "murderer" AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. It is seen as putting potential partners in a situation where they might not know they are communicating with a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.

## Broader Ethical Considerations

Across all of Kaiser's "hacks," a core ethical issue is the lack of consent from the individuals being tracked, deceived, or interacted with by an AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. The prevailing sentiment is that "just because you can, doesn't mean you should" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

Kaiser's actions are described as "morally gray at best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>, often justified as "big brain hacks" or pranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. However, this normalization of problematic behavior is concerning, especially as people may overlook the [[importance_of_maintaining_ethical_boundaries_in_tech_innovation | ethics]] when a technological solution promises a desired outcome like finding love or gaining fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. The ethical implications of using advanced technology for such social manipulation, even if framed as [[the_ethics_of_pranking | pranks]] or experiments, remain a significant topic of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

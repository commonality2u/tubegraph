The repetitive and [[impact_of_clickbait_in_animated_stories|clickbait]] nature of titles used by channels like "[[analysis_of_fake_animated_story_channels|Actually Happened]]" led to an exploration of how these titles could be algorithmically generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The consistent patterns in their titles suggested that an AI could potentially create believable versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Methodology

A statistical modeling technique called Markov chains was employed to generate new titles based on existing "[[analysis_of_fake_animated_story_channels|Actually Happened]]" video titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This method analyzes all words in the original titles to determine the likelihood of one word following another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This process is similar to how text suggestions function on a smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. For example, titles starting with "my" frequently follow with "mom," "dad," or "parents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. By mapping these probabilities for every word, a program was created to generate new titles that sound like "[[analysis_of_fake_animated_story_channels|Actually Happened]]" content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

## Characteristics of Algorithmic Titles

The generation process aimed to replicate specific characteristics observed in [[fake_animated_stories|fake animated stories]]:
*   **First-person perspective** – Titles often begin with "I" or "my" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Focus on a specific character** – The event usually happens to the narrator, their mom, dad, or a crush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Negative events** – Despite good things sometimes performing well, titles predominantly feature negative themes such as death, crime, betrayal, or emotional manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Examples of Generated Titles

Using this algorithm, several titles were generated, including:
*   "My dad became an Instagram star overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>
*   "I almost drowned and lost all my money in a card game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>
*   "My girlfriend is a grandma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>
*   "I had a [[fake_animated_stories|fake]] boyfriend but he taught me something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>
*   "My dad's last gift went missing and it killed their family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>
*   "My friends think I'm a vegetarian and my dad fucking crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>

## Online Tool

A website, animatedstorytitles.com, was created to allow users to generate their own "[[analysis_of_fake_animated_story_channels|Actually Happened]]"-style titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Script Generation Attempt

An attempt was also made to use a sophisticated language model (GPT-2) to generate full "[[analysis_of_fake_animated_story_channels|Actually Happened]]" scripts by feeding it subtitle files from existing videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. However, this effort was unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

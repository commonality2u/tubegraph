Public schools in the United States are often "criminally underfunded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This underfunding forces teachers to use their personal funds to purchase necessary classroom supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. For instance, a psychology teacher had to buy their own staples because the school wouldn't pay for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Impact of Underfunding

The issue of underfunding is exacerbated by trends like "devious licks," where students steal items from school property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The need for schools to spend more money on repairing damages from these thefts further strains their already limited budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. School-wide emails confirm that vandalism and theft "cost the school valuable resources, time, and money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

The [[effects_of_theft_on_schools | effects of theft on schools]] are stark, with some math classes being so underfunded that there are no valuable items for students to steal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## Teacher Perspectives on Funding and Vandalism

Some teachers express a complex view on school vandalism. One middle school teacher stated they were "personally pro vandalism in order to cause trouble and stick it to an administration school district that bleeds money to malicious textbook companies and dumb technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This perspective highlights a sentiment that school funds are sometimes mismanaged, not benefiting students as directly as they could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

However, this same teacher also recognized the need to protect their "personal investments" (books bought for students) and ensure students can wash their hands, showing a conflict between their anti-administration stance and practical needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. The [[responses_from_schools_and_teachers_to_the_trend | responses from schools and teachers to the trend]] often reflect this struggle with diminishing resources.

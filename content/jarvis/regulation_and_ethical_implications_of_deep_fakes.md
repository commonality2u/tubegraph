[[understanding_deep_fakes | Deep fakes]] are a form of synthetic media where a person in an existing image or video has their likeness replaced with someone else's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The creation of [[deep_fakes_in_media_and_entertainment | deep fakes]] utilizes [[the_technology_behind_deep_fakes | artificial intelligence (AI)]] and a large number of photographs and references of the target individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. Celebrities, such as Tom Cruise, are easier subjects for deep fakes due to the abundant visual data available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. While some viral instances, like the deep fake Tom Cruise videos on TikTok, are created for entertainment or to showcase technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, there are significant [[risks_and_concerns_of_deep_fake_usage | ethical and societal concerns]] surrounding their use.

## [[risks_and_concerns_of_deep_fake_usage | Risks and Concerns of Deep Fake Usage]]

[[understanding_deep_fakes | Deep fakes]] have been used for harmful purposes, such as taking someone's likeness and placing it into "lewd video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This type of misuse is considered "very bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Other "horrifying instances" include deepfaking a person's face onto another's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

The technology extends beyond video, with research being done into "deep fakes for audio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. The combination of audio and video deep fakes creates a situation where "nothing is real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of digital media and the potential for manipulation.

One real-world example of misuse involves a Pennsylvania woman accused of doctoring photos and videos of her daughter's cheerleading rivals to get them removed from the squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. This incident led to three misdemeanor counts of cyber harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>, highlighting the "real problem" that deep fakes pose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.

## Ethical and Societal Implications

The proliferation of deep fakes contributes to a broader issue where it is an "impossible task" to verify the authenticity of everything seen online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. Expecting every individual to critically assess every piece of content is "foolhardy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>.

Deep fakes can be an "insidious foot in the door to more dangerous things down the line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>, mirroring how "fake news" operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. This technology preys on the fact that people cannot be critical of "every single thing that comes out of the internet's fire hose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. When a deep fake aligns with a pre-existing worldview (e.g., Tom Cruise being kooky), and is viewed passively without audio, it can simply confirm that worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. This mechanism can be exploited for [[ethics_of_using_technology_for_social_manipulation | nefarious purposes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>.

The practice of deep faking someone, especially a public figure like Charli D'Amelio (who is also a child), is considered a "breach of that privacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. This points to [[ethics_of_blending_fiction_and_reality_on_social_media | ethical concerns about privacy]] and the appropriation of a person's likeness without consent.

## Regulation and Awareness

TikTok has a policy regarding deep fakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>. For example, accounts that deep fake Charli D'Amelio and try to impersonate her are removed, while deep fake Tom Cruise videos were allowed because it was clear they were deep fakes and not an attempt at impersonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. This indicates a distinction in policy based on intentâ€”whether the content is clearly labeled as synthetic or attempts to deceive.

While the exact method of regulation is complex, it is crucial for society to be aware of what is technologically "possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>. This awareness is likened to understanding sleight of hand: if one doesn't know it's a trick, they might believe in magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>. It is important "not to believe everything you see" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>, as even without complex visual effects, it's possible to be influenced by random content online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.

There is a "slippery slope" with deep fakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. While the impact of some deep fakes, like Tom Cruise golfing, may seem minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>, others can have more serious consequences, such as misidentifying individuals in videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>. Many people are still unaware of deep fakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>, highlighting the need for increased public understanding of this technology and its implications.

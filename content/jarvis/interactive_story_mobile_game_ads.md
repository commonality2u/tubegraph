Interactive story mobile games, including *Choices*, *Episode*, and *Chapter*, are identified as competitors within a distinct genre [03:13]. The names of these games often sound similar [03:19], and they feature some of the most absurd advertisements [03:26].

## Common Advertising Themes

These games typically involve players making important choices within submitted stories [03:33]. The advertisements frequently highlight scandalous scenarios, such as a character forgetting their girlfriend was coming over, presenting choices like "hide under the bed" or "maybe she can join us" [03:36]. The stories depicted in these ads predominantly revolve around themes of sex, cheating, and pregnancy [03:57].

Advertisements may also feature confusing imagery and text, such as a combination of emojis (egg, water droplets, cat, hatching chick) or seemingly random words like "Time, Hotel, Bikini" [04:10]. An example ad showed a character "thirst texting" her ex, with the initial text being "sex," while already in bed with someone else [04:32]. Despite the often illicit content, taglines like "Chapters experience your fantasy your way" are used, implying that being caught cheating is part of the player's potential fantasy [04:54].

## Absurd Scenarios in Ads

The level of drama in these interactive story ads is described as unprecedented [06:49].

One example ad for [[overview_of_animated_story_channels | Episode]] features an attractive man and woman at a pool. The player is given choices such as "kiss him" or "pull him into the water" [05:30]. After choosing to pull him into the water, he immediately starts drowning in waist-deep water [05:42]. Subsequent choices include "Oops!" or "Save him," followed by "give him CPR" or "call a doctor" [06:04]. The man is then revealed to be faking, leading to further choices like continuing CPR or kissing him to find out if he's faking [06:29]. The absurdity is highlighted by the question of whether one should kiss a dying man if he isn't faking [06:43].

Another scenario involves a man with both a pregnant wife and a pregnant girlfriend, neither of whom knows about the other [07:09]. The wife catches her husband on a date while picking up takeout [07:21]. The husband's confidence in taking his secret pregnant girlfriend on dates near his home, despite his wife being nearly nine months pregnant, is noted as staggering [07:32]. Choices for the wife include "ask about the baby," leading to speculative outcomes like an unlikely friendship or a reality show [07:46].

A medical-themed ad depicts a doctor being told by a pregnant woman's husband to "get away from my wife," despite the doctor performing medical duties [08:56]. The ad includes a bizarre statement from the doctor, "The baby was never yours," implying a fluid paternity that makes no biological sense [09:22].

## Mobile Game Ads and Developer Practices

The pervasive nature of [[misleading_mobile_game_ads | very bad ads for very bad mobile games]] is a significant issue [00:18]. These ads, sometimes featuring [[ad_targeting_for_mobile_games | ad targeting]] based on user demographics [01:14], create highly specific and often absurd scenarios.

Voodoo, a French app developer and major game publisher on iOS and Android, is identified as being behind many of these strange ads and nonsensical text captions [11:12]. Despite their games often being described as low quality [11:30], Voodoo is a large company frequently accused of copying other games, likened to "five minutes crafts of mobile games" [11:36]. Voodoo received a $200 million investment from Goldman Sachs [11:44].

Voodoo runs thousands of ad campaigns, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly [13:10]. They appear to use a "shotgun approach," trying random text phrases on random gameplay videos to see what performs best [13:48]. Common nonsensical phrases include "I think my brain just broke," "named after my ex," "if you score 20 you're legally skilled," and "if you score 20 you're legally allowed to leave" [13:24]. There's also a recurring, inexplicable obsession with "reaching Japan" or "pink color" in their ad captions [13:54].

A particularly egregious ad discovered in Voodoo's discontinued campaigns featured "Unlock all the weapons by nuking planets" and depicted dropping bombs on Earth, with Kim Jong Un placed in the ad [14:32].

Concerns about [[privacy_and_data_protection_in_mobile_gaming | ad targeting]] and [[privacy_and_data_protection_in_mobile_gaming | privacy]] are raised, noting that mobile games might be [[privacy_and_data_protection_in_mobile_gaming | tracking user data]] and internet service providers could sell browsing history to advertisers [15:00].

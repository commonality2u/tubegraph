The metaverse is defined as an aspirational version of reality existing solely online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. While concepts like Second Life and VR Chat have existed, Facebook's (Meta's) version, known as [[Critique of Facebooks Horizon Worlds | Meta Horizon Worlds]], serves as a current example for exploring social interactions in virtual reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## User Demographics and Presence Challenges

Despite significant investment, Meta Horizon Worlds faces challenges with user numbers and demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Although Meta claims 200,000 monthly users, many worlds are often empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

### The Pervasive Presence of Children
A significant issue is the prevalence of children in spaces seemingly intended for general or adult audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Horizon Worlds is rated for teens, yet many avatars do not resemble teenagers, and children are frequently encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **Comedy Clubs**: Often overrun by pre-teens, leading to offensive jokes and slurs reminiscent of a middle school cafeteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Despite rules against profanity and derogatory jokes, these are frequently ignored by younger users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Bowling World**: Encountered a young child (referred to as an "infant") who was skilled at the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Lack of Adult Protection**: While Meta has features to protect children from adults, there are no effective tools to protect adults from [[Childrens presence in adult virtual spaces | children's presence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Metacourt**: A role-playing court system world, entirely organized and populated by children, leading to chaos and frequent user kicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

This pervasive presence of children, who are not even supposed to be in the metaverse, contributes to the feeling of abandonment and chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

## Types of Social Spaces and Interactions

### Public/Open Worlds
Many worlds in Horizon Worlds rely on "proximity chat," where users hear voices based on their virtual distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

*   **Comedy Clubs**: Designed for performances, but often filled with children and chaotic conversations, sometimes with adults complaining about [[Childrens presence in adult virtual spaces | children's behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Dance Clubs**: Can be completely empty, highlighting the low user count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
*   **Disneyland VR Parody**: An impressive user-created world but generally boring and empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
*   **Family Guy World**: Described as "horrifying," featuring an unsettling interaction with another user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

### Curated/Adult-Focused Worlds
Users attempted to find spaces specifically for adults, typically by searching "18 plus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

*   **Gatsby's Bar**: Features an "anti-child technology" requiring an arm span greater than 4.9 feet to enter a holding cell before gaining access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This bar can be very quiet during the day but picks up significantly at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
    *   Notable interaction: The "basketball boys," particularly "Slim," who relentlessly plays basketball, symbolizing dedication within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Thrive Pavilion (Senior Center)**: A noble initiative to combat loneliness among older adults, featuring activities like a book club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. While often empty, it can host genuine, albeit sometimes awkward, adult social gatherings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
*   **Scenic Bar**: A more popular "18 plus" world with a scenic view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. This space offers a realistic emulation of social anxiety, allowing users to stand just outside conversation circles without being rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Black Magic Club**: A comedy club explicitly designed to exclude children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.
    *   Notable interaction: "Silent Mike," a man playing beer pong alone, who provides silent support during a basketball shooting session, demonstrating a positive, non-verbal connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. This interaction highlights the potential for unexpected bonds in virtual spaces, even without explicit conversation.

### Business and Brand Interactions
Some spaces are dedicated to business or brand promotions.

*   **Business Panel**: A more formal adult gathering discussing businesses in the metaverse, characterized by "buzzwords" and attendees floating in the direction of speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   **Wendyverse**: Wendy's is Meta's only official corporate partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. The "Wendyverse" is an empty world designed like a Wendy's restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. This demonstrates limited [[consumer_behavior_and_brand_interactions_on_social_media | brand engagement]] within Horizon Worlds.

## Challenges and Critiques

Horizon Worlds faces significant challenges that hinder its social appeal:

*   **Low User Count**: Most worlds are empty, making it difficult to find people to interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The narrator experienced loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The platform feels abandoned despite Meta's claimed monthly user numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   **Lack of Moderation**: The prevalence of slurs and offensive jokes, particularly from children, creates an unwelcoming environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Technical Limitations**:
    *   **Graphics**: The graphics are criticized as poor, resembling "Wii Sports" but without legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   **No Legs**: Avatars consist only of floating torsos, which is "unnerving" and makes movement feel stiff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This impacts the realism of interactions and the overall [[experience_of_living_in_the_metaverse | experience of living in the metaverse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   **Motion Sickness**: Natural movement options can cause nausea for some users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   **Interaction Clunkiness**: Basic actions like picking up objects or shooting a basketball can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **Monotony**: Many worlds feature similar "janky mini-games and balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Repetitive Interactions**: Due to the small user base, users often encounter the same faces, making it feel like a "large high school" where everyone knows each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. This can contribute to feeling like an outsider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

The [[experience_of_living_in_the_metaverse | experience of living in the metaverse]] through Meta Horizon Worlds highlights significant design and social challenges, questioning its viability for widespread social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.

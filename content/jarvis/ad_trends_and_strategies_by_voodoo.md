Mobile game advertisements are frequently criticized for their poor quality and often absurd content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. These ads often employ aggressive [[ad_targeting_and_tracking_on_the_internet|ad targeting]] methods, such as appearing to an 18 to 35-year-old single male in California who watches Game of Thrones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Characteristics of Mobile Game Ads

Many mobile game ads feature highly unrealistic and bizarre scenarios:

*   **Prison Break Game**: One ad for a word game is set in prison, where the goal is to break out using words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The art style of this ad resembles the webcomic *Cyanide and Happiness* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Escape attempts in the ad involve characters attempting to walk out of prison in a giant human-sized sack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> or spelling simple words like "Bone" to trigger a suitcase falling from the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Interactive Story Games**: Games like *Choices*, *Episode*, and *Chapter* are competitors in a genre featuring player-driven narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Their ads often depict absurd and high-drama scenarios, frequently revolving around themes of sex, cheating, and pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Examples include choices like "hide under the bed" or "maybe she can join us" when a girlfriend arrives unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, or a character asking "should I make a romantic advance? Or try to drown him" when presented with a love interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. These stories are characterized by "unprecedented" levels of drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. One dramatic plot involves a man with a pregnant wife and a pregnant girlfriend who meet by chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Nonsensical and Self-Deprecating Ads

Some mobile game ads feature baffling and contradictory captions:
*   "Real men, don't get wet?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>
*   "I never knew anxiety until I played this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
*   "How many neurons can you break?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>
*   "This game will ruin your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>

These captions are often applied randomly to different games, suggesting a lack of coherence in their [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media|marketing strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Voodoo: A Major Player in Mobile Game Advertising

The company behind many of these "upsetting ads" is Voodoo, a French app developer and one of the largest game publishers on iOS and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Voodoo is known for being both the game developers and the creators of these unusual text captions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Despite their games often being described as "garbage," Voodoo received a $200 million investment from Goldman Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. They are also frequently accused of copying other people's games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### Voodoo's Advertising Strategy

Voodoo employs an extensive advertising strategy on platforms like Facebook and Instagram:
*   **Scale**: Voodoo runs a massive number of ad campaigns, with over 8,000 active campaigns in the US alone, suggesting they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly on ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Shotgun Approach**: They appear to use a "shotgun approach," testing random pieces of text on various gameplay videos to see what performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Bizarre Trends**: Recurring phrases and concepts in their ads include:
    *   "If you reach Japan, you're legally skilled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
    *   "Only left-brain people can reach the pink color" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   **Controversial Content**: Voodoo has run ads that have been discontinued, including one for a game where players "unlock all the weapons by nuking planets" and featured an image of Kim Jong Un <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

The pervasive nature and often dystopian quality of these ads highlight concerns about [[ad_targeting_and_tracking_on_the_internet|advertising and ad targeting]] practices online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Jarvis, a former software engineer now an engineering manager, reflects on how his childhood passions and interests unexpectedly shaped his career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He emphasizes that pursuits driven by [[the_importance_of_genuine_passion_in_career_success | genuine passion]], rather than solely financial motivation, have been central to his life's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Early Foundations: Making and Competing

From a young age, Jarvis developed a love for "making things." At seven years old, he wanted to be an artist, enjoying drawing characters from Dragon Ball Z, which solidified his interest in creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

This passion was coupled with a strong competitive drive and a love for self-improvement:
*   **Obsessive Nature** Jarvis describes himself as obsessive, pouring himself entirely into whatever he wants to excel at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Conversely, he admits to having "horrible grit" when not interested in a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Love for Learning** He enjoys starting from "nothing" at a skill and slowly becoming proficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Embracing Challenges** Despite disliking failure, he relishes the feeling of being an underdog, using it to push beyond perceived limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Competitive Gaming** His competitive spirit was honed through playing games like Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic: The Gathering, and Chess competitively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He was deeply involved in an online Pokémon battling community, writing guides on Eevee training and appearing on a Pokémon [[role_of_podcasts_and_hobbies_in_developing_programming_skills | podcast]] under a pseudonym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Unforeseen Pathways to Software Engineering

Jarvis's journey into [[considerations_before_pursuing_a_career_in_software_engineering | software engineering]] began with seemingly unrelated interests:

### Seventh Grade Technology Class
In 2005, a 7th-grade technology class introduced him to Macs and the Macromedia suite (Photoshop, Dreamweaver), allowing him to create websites, videos, and Flash animations and games using ActionScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Although he didn't learn to code himself at this stage, relying on a classmate named Jerry, the experience "mystified" him about programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### The Influence of Podcasting
His deeper dive into programming was serendipitously linked to [[role_of_podcasts_and_hobbies_in_developing_programming_skills | podcasting]].
*   **Discovery of Computer Science** Around 2006, he started listening to [[role_of_podcasts_and_hobbies_in_developing_programming_skills | podcasts]], initially about Dragon Ball Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. One of these led him to "Geek Nights," a [[role_of_podcasts_and_hobbies_in_developing_programming_skills | podcast]] by two recent college graduates working in tech in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. It was through this show that he first learned about computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Hands-on Programming** Inspired, he also decided to start his own [[role_of_podcasts_and_hobbies_in_developing_programming_skills | podcast]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Soon after, a friend showed him how to write programs on TI-84 calculators, which quickly became an addiction and led him to study computer science in college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Transition to Engineering Management

Jarvis's current role as an engineering manager also draws heavily on past interests:
*   **Improv Comedy** He became obsessed with Saturday Night Live and idolized comedians like Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Andy Samberg, eventually pursuing improv comedy when he moved to San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. He took every class and performed almost weekly for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Coaching** As he gained experience in [[considerations_before_pursuing_a_career_in_software_engineering | software engineering]], he learned about the collaborative aspects of software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. He observed that high-performing teams were also the happiest, and that people often leave managers, not companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. He realized he could apply lessons from improv, particularly regarding team dynamics, and his experience coaching as a college teaching assistant and industry mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This realization led him to transition into an engineering manager role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Conclusion: The Evolving Nature of Interests
Jarvis concludes by noting that current interests rarely lead to expected outcomes, using the example of his middle school programming whiz friend becoming a zoologist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. He stresses that interests, even when they seem to fade, are "never really gone" because they contribute to shaping one's present and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The beauty of life lies in the unknown path ahead when one steps forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

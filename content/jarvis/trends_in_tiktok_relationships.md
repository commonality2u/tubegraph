Jarvis returns to discuss concerning [[commentary_on_tiktok_trends | TikTok trends]], specifically focusing on "weird relationship TikToks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. According to Jarvis, [[tiktok_pranks_and_trends | TikTok]] has become a "hotbed of POVs about abusive relationships," featuring sketches and act-outs that depict "bad habits in 60 seconds or less" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Focus on Specific TikTok Relationship Content

### The TikTok Stepsibling Controversy

One particular area of concern highlighted is a [[tiktok_stepsibling_controversy | TikTok stepsibling couple]] who are also boyfriend and girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Their content often involves adapting existing sibling trends and then concluding with them kissing, which Jarvis finds uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Concerning Content
> Jarvis notes that even without the familial relation, watching strangers make out on [[tiktok_pranks_and_trends | TikTok]] is undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

The couple frequently uses hashtags like #stepsist, #stepbro, #siblings, and #relationship in their videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

#### "The Alpha" Persona and Costumes

A prominent theme in their videos is the male partner's "alpha" persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This often involves wearing costumes, such as police uniforms, and portraying aggressive or possessive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Jarvis questions why they are constantly in Halloween costumes and refers to them as "cosplay" inappropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

One specific video depicts the male partner, referred to as "the alpha," wearing sunglasses indoors and displaying aggressive movements, often captioned "the alpha is back stronger than ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

#### Perceived Toxic Relationship Dynamics

The couple's content often features scenarios that depict controlling or possessive behaviors:
*   **"Baby Voice" and Control**: In one clip, the female uses a "baby voice" asking if the male has "found any girl pretty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The male then aggressively pulls her back onto the bed, saying "I meant you," which Jarvis interprets as a forceful action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **"Nothing to Be Scared Of"**: A particularly "creepy" line from the male partner, "There's nothing to be scared of, your stepbro loves you," is noted for its unsettling context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **"How Alphas Eat a Banana"**: A video showing the male eating a banana in an exaggerated "non-sus way" is criticized for promoting "toxic masculinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.

#### Evolution of Their Content Strategy

Initially, the female partner's [[tiktok_pranks_and_trends | TikTok]] account featured "normal ass dentist TikToks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a> and participated in trends like "pumping gas and dancing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. They even had a video where the male partner rated other [[tiktok_pranks_and_trends | TikTok]] girls, which seemed "normal" and "relatable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, though Jarvis was concerned they were rating minors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

The [[tiktok_stepsibling_controversy | stepsibling content]] began in March of the current year (2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, coinciding with the pandemic, while the "alpha aggressive boyfriend thing" started slightly earlier in January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The first explicit mention of the stepbrother situation was in a "go to hell challenge" video where she listed dating her stepbrother as a "sin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

#### Audience Reaction and Response to Criticism

When viewers began expressing concern about their relationship, the couple created a video addressing the criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. They initially appeared to concede but then stated, "too bad for you, we love each other, and if you don't like it, well, too bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Jarvis interprets this as them being genuinely upset by the criticism despite actively promoting their controversial relationship for views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

#### Culturally Insensitive Content

Beyond the relationship dynamics, the couple has also created "Bollywood videos" that Jarvis finds "cringy and at worst culturally insensitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, especially given that neither appears to be of Indian descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

### Overall Reflection on [[portrayal_of_relationships_on_social_media | Portrayal of Relationships on Social Media]]

Jarvis concludes that the "alpha familia" couple's content is "certainly cringe" and normalizes "toxic relationship behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. While acknowledging that there's "more harmful content out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a> and creators are trying to navigate the "weird media landscape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>, Jarvis suggests that their previous "normal TikToks... worked just fine" and they "didn't have to lean so hard into the stepsibling thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Ultimately, it's recognized that they found a strategy that is "working" in terms of gaining followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.

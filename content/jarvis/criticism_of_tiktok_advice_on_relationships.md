From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The search for understanding "how women work" led to [[trends_in_tiktok_relationships | TikTok]], where "nice boys" offer explanations to "females" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, it is immediately recognized that seeking [[critique_of_online_relationship_advice | advice from TikTok]] is ill-advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Rise of "Alpha Males" Online
"Alpha male" pickup artists are not a new phenomenon, but they consistently appear online to share their worldview with impressionable followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. There is a common view that "alpha males don't exist" and that their advice is a "scam" that can be harmful and "scare women away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It is also noted that "women aren't all the same" and "can't be trained like dogs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Analysis of Zay Double Edge's Advice
One prominent figure giving advice on [[trends_in_tiktok_relationships | TikTok relationships]] is "Zay Double Edge" (dbe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Zay also has a book titled "Stop Getting Left On Red Get Nudes Instead: Rules, Tips, and Strategies to Become an Elite Texter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Initial Stages of Relationships
Zay advises men to "not be taking no woman seriously" in the beginning stages of a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. He suggests that a "real woman should have to almost beat you up just so you can take her seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. He criticizes comments as "incels" for taking women too seriously, stating that relationships are a "game" that should be "fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This advice is interpreted as not getting too invested in early-stage relationships, with a caveat about the harsh labeling of commenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### "Woman's Top Manipulation Strategy"
According to Zay, if a woman wants to show she's "moving on" or believes you "lost something good" after a breakup, she will post "indirect pictures" on social media to imply she's with another guy without actually showing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Examples include photos of "empty wine glasses" or implying a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This is described as a "test" to see how "weak" a man is; a "strong dude" will "not say nothing" and she will "come back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This analysis of "manipulation" is met with skepticism, noting that if a woman posts wine photos, she's "testing" you, but if she's "done with you, she's done with you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Critique of American Men and Women
Zay states that "american women are so hard to deal with and are so arrogant" because "the average american guy is a simp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. He claims men are "literally programmed to be a simp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He advocates for men to "stand on principles" and "say whatever the fuck you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### "Die on Your Principles"
Zay advises that a "real man is gonna die on principles," regardless of whether they are "right or wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. He cites figures like "MLK," "Malcolm X," and "Osama Bin Laden" as examples of those who "all died on principles," suggesting this lack of principles is why "you see what you see today" in men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Women's Emotional Nature
Women are described as "emotional beings" who "feel their emotions deeply" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. A "heartbreak to a woman hurts just as much as them grieving over somebody's death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Women "break like glass" and "never really fully recover," often not seeking therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The source of this information is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Women as "Programmable"
Zay asserts that a "woman's past matters" and that previous men "programmed her that she should not be treated that way" if she doesn't appreciate being treated like a queen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. He explicitly states, "women are programmable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Signs of Being "Thirsty"
Zay outlines signs that a man is "thirsty" (desperate for a relationship):
1.  **Complaining about your love life**: If a man complains that women "always pick the bad boys" and "overlook the good guys," he is signaling he's "thirsty" and seeking "pity sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
2.  **Failing at "game"**: If a man is "learning game" but "still having a problem with women," it's because he's "so thirsty you throw all the game right out the window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
3.  **Not knowing what questions to ask**: This indicates a man is "so thirsty for sex" that he "don't even care who she truly is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

### "Deep-Rooted Core Masculinity Principles"
Zay presents principles he claims fathers should have taught their sons:
1.  **"Never go to a man asking for a favor with an empty hand"**: He applies this to asking him for free advice, stating it's "beta male" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. He implies that asking for more free advice suggests one was "raised in a feminine ass household" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
2.  **"Never tolerate disrespect from anyone"**: This principle advises one "should rather be put six feet under than to be disrespected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
3.  **"Never walking around with your head down"**: One should "always be alert and knowing what's going on around you" to avoid being "easiest ones to get robbed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### Suppression of Emotions
Zay advises men to "never express his feelings" when a woman is "begging you to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. He states that a woman needs a man to express emotions because "she feels insecure and powerless in a relationship," and buckling under pressure makes one a "beta male simp mangina" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### Men's Struggle and the "Microwave Age"
Zay claims "nobody give a fuck about us [men]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. He contrasts this with women, who are "born a princess" and "on the highest of the pedestal," while a man "has to make himself a prince or a king" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. He attributes men's depression, sadness, and unsuccessfulness to being "a victim of the microwave age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. He claims men are "scared to take risks" and "scared of what other people think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. True happiness and masculinity are only achieved by thriving "in discomfort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### Measuring Attraction: "Compliance"
Zay states that "God gave women this unique ability to be able to be in tune with the emotional and spiritual world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. He claims women know when a man doesn't like cuddling without being told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

However, the primary way to measure a woman's attraction level is "how compliant she is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. He states that once a woman "starts to say yes to you and she starts to comply with you, by default her feminine nature will make her like you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. This implies women "doesn't have free will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## Conclusion on TikTok Relationship Advice

*   It's "too hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

The host concludes that "it just seems easier to be myself" and encourages others to "be whatever you are" because "you don't have to change" and "you get to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

With the launch of new streaming services, there has been a significant trend towards [[Netflix reality TV production | original series]] and the [[Dramatization and editing in reality TV | rebooting]] of beloved franchises. Disney+, which launched at midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, exemplifies this by offering a mix of nostalgic content from childhood, previously available on Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, and new exclusive productions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Disney's extensive ownership of intellectual property positions Disney+ for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Notable Reboots and Spin-offs on Disney+

Among the new offerings on Disney+, several reboots and spin-offs aim to attract both new and old audiences:
*   A Star Wars spin-off focusing on Boba Fett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   A [[Critique of Disney Channel original movies | Lizzie McGuire]] reboot, depicting the character as a millennial navigating adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   A unique reboot of *High School Musical* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## High School Musical: The Musical: The Series

The *High School Musical* reboot, titled *High School Musical: The Musical: The Series* (HSM:TM:TS), is a mockumentary set at the actual high school in Salt Lake City, Utah, where the original *High School Musical* movie was filmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Premise and Format
In the show's universe, *High School Musical* is a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, and the series follows a group of theater kids at East High who decide to stage their school's first-ever production of *High School Musical: The Musical* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The show is released episode by episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, fostering community among viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. The meta-narrative, with a documentary being filmed about the students, is a key element, though the purpose of the documentary is not explicitly stated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Characters
The series introduces a new cast of high school students:
*   **Ricky**: An 18-year-old skater boy who dislikes musicals but is destined to play Troy in the school production. He is initially motivated to join the musical to get back together with Nini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Nini**: The "Gabriella" of the cast, a quintessential theater kid who has never had a leading role, often playing minor parts like a tree or the back of a cow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Big Red**: Ricky's best friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **EJ Caswell**: Nini's new boyfriend, a popular and talented athlete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Gina**: A theater pro who transferred to East High to be in the musical, serving as the "Sharpay" of the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Plot Synopsis (First Episode)
The first episode opens with Miss Jen, the new drama teacher, watching the original *High School Musical* movie in the school parking lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The show references the original movie frequently, making it difficult to watch without prior knowledge of the source material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Ricky and Nini, who were dating, took a break over the summer at Ricky's suggestion due to his fear of commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. While Nini was at theater camp, she started dating EJ Caswell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Ricky, now jealous, decides to audition for the musical to get closer to Nini, despite his dislike for musicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

During auditions, all the students display impressive talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Ricky, late to his audition, sings Nini's original song from Instagram, which had initially been a public declaration of her love for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Despite Nini and EJ's frustration with Ricky's actions, the cast list reveals that Ricky and Nini are cast as Troy and Gabriella, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

### Reception of the Reboot
The show is considered surprisingly good, especially given the common pitfalls of reboots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. It is praised for being funny and well-written, seemingly by a genuine *High School Musical* fan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The premise is said to work well, and the cast is noted for being talented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. The series successfully balances content for both kid and adult audiences, positioning itself as the "next chapter for *High School Musical* fans old and new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

The landscape of [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brands on social media]] has evolved, with [[brands_seeking_clout_and_attention | brands seeking clout and attention]] through unconventional means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. What began as individual [[the_impact_of_brand_antics_on_consumer_perception | brand antics]] on platforms like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> has spread across social media, making brands "inescapable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. These efforts often aim to garner free advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a> and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## The Humanization of Brands

A significant [[marketing_and_brand_deals | marketing]] push has been to transform brands into entities with human-like qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This strategy, known as [[the_humanization_and_personification_of_brands | the humanization and personification of brands]], involves them acting like real people with specific personality traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This approach aims for [[brands_using_social_media_for_relatable_content | brands using social media for relatable content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

Previously, brands like MoonPie were characterized as "stoners" and Sunny D as "sad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. This strategy has proven successful, leading consumers to expect brands to be "absurd and weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## "Brands Are Just Like Us"

This segment highlights how brands mirror human behaviors and interactions on social media:

*   **Content Creation**
    *   Wendy's, known for "roasting people," has ventured into writing fan fiction on Wattpad, creating stories like "The Lemonade Charade" and "The Forbidden Fruit Tea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. These stories attempt to empathize with working people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
    *   The Bagel Bites Twitter account notably tweets about topics other than bagel bites, further reinforcing the "brands are just like us" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **Social Interactions**
    *   Brands engage in social activities, such as playing "Among Us" together. Participants have included Sunny D, Tatino's, Bugles, Gushers, Chex Mix, and Kids Foot Locker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
    *   Brands express emotions, with McDonald's portraying depression and receiving support from other accounts like Fall Guys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.
    *   Brands even criticize other brands on how they use social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
    *   Personal interactions occur, such as the Slim Jim account sending direct messages (DMs) to content creators to express appreciation for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. This blurs the line between a corporate entity and a human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
*   **Family Dynamics**
    *   The Xbox account engaged in "paternal squabbles" in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.

## Ridiculous Stunts for Attention

Beyond mere social media presence, brands undertake elaborate stunts to capture attention:

*   **Celebrity Collaborations**
    *   McDonald's "cursed" Travis Scott, turning him into a Happy Meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a> and J Balvin into a chain, leveraging a pun on "chains" for their restaurant locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **Physical Manifestations of Memes**
    *   Xbox created a real-life fridge based on a meme comparing its console to a refrigerator, giving it to Snoop Dogg and iJustine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. The primary reason for this was to generate discussion and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Products**
    *   KFC released a dating simulator on Steam featuring Colonel Sanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
    *   KFC also announced a gaming console called the KFConsole, which was designed to warm chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. This was presented with a mock apology for a release date delay, citing challenges with the "chicken chamber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.

## The Labor Behind the Antics

The creation of this content often involves social media managers whose jobs may be undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. Some companies, such as GameStop, have sought to capitalize on [[employeedriven_social_media_trends_and_brand_capitalisation | employee-driven social media trends]] by encouraging their employees to create TikToks to gain fame and attract customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. This raises concerns about companies exploiting their employees' creativity for "free labor" without commensurate pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

## The Endless Cycle and Its Impact

The prevailing cycle is that brands perform unusual or "weird" actions, leading to public discussion, which in turn generates money for the brands, perpetuating the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. This dynamic means that engaging with and discussing these brand antics, even critically, plays directly into their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. The [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | impact of social media engagements by brands]] often results in their content being more desirable than their actual products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. Ultimately, this demonstrates how "brands can break your heart, just like us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

During periods of self-isolation, celebrities have attempted to entertain from their homes, leading to varied results and offering a unique [[perspective_on_celebrity_culture_during_pandemic|perspective on fame]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:01">[03:25:01]</a>. While some celebrities faced personal challenges like relocating mansions or missing events, others were compelled to produce content from their residences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19">[01:42:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

The experience has been likened to "Groundhog Day if Groundhog Day was a movie where Bill Murray wakes up every morning to a global pandemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>.

## Categories of Celebrity Coping Mechanisms

Celebrity reactions to the new reality generally fall into two categories:

### Celebrities Who Would Rather Be Working
This group includes those who are typically busy with productions but are now unable to work, such as Gal Gadot, Sophie Turner, Joe Jonas, and Vanessa Hudgens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:01">[03:36:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:33">[03:50:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:08">[04:03:08]</a>.

### Celebrities Attempting to Work From Home
Many celebrities with day television shows or other regular productions have tried to recreate their "television magic" remotely without studio equipment or crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:03">[04:24:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:16">[04:29:16]</a>. The results of these attempts have been mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

## Notable Examples of At-Home Content

### Gal Gadot's "Imagine" Video
Gal Gadot organized a video where she called upon her famous friends to sing John Lennon's "Imagine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:09">[04:49:09]</a>. This video was posted about 150 days prior to the commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:08">[04:43:08]</a> and received significant backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:06">[08:01:06]</a>.

> "It's bad. Much has already been said about the singing in this video and the celebrities in this video but did you know there are other parts? I didn't and now that I do it's worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:06">[04:56:06]</a>.

Critiques included:
*   The video was made only six days into self-quarantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   The song "Imagine" was deemed not truly applicable to the situation, as it's not a war unless one counts the war against the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:30">[05:51:30]</a>.
*   The video was seen as [[tonedeafness_of_celebrities_during_crises|tone-deaf]] both musically and socially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.
*   Many participating celebrities were not primarily musical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
*   Unlike an Italian trumpeter who played for his community, the celebrity version appeared to be for attention rather than genuinely cheering up a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

### Kristin Chenoweth's TikToks
Actress and singer Kristin Chenoweth, known for "Wicked," posted TikTok videos that relied on a single joke involving singing a high note when putting cheese on pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:09">[08:54:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

### Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas
This couple posted TikToks featuring their completed Harry Potter Lego sets without additional context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:50">[09:51:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. They also shared cooking videos on Instagram Live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:09">[10:09:09]</a>. These instances reflect celebrities who are simply bored and share that feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

### Ellen DeGeneres' Show
During quarantine, Ellen DeGeneres compared lockdown to being in jail from her giant mansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Reports also emerged that her employees were concerned about their pay because she hired an external company to film her show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

### Late-Night Comedy Shows
Many late-night shows continued production remotely, which helps non-famous entertainment workers maintain stable jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
*   **John Oliver** filmed from what appeared to be the afterlife, maintaining an engaging presence despite the lack of a live audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.
*   **Seth Meyers** recorded his "A Closer Look" segments in an echoey room, highlighting the poor camera quality in TV production compared to internet content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.
*   **Trevor Noah** of "The Daily Show" used a good camera and adopted a YouTube-like editing style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.
*   **Commonalities:** Many remote late-night shows featured hosts at home, incorporated family members, and had kids draw title cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.

#### Jimmy Fallon's "Tonight Show At Home"
Jimmy Fallon's "Tonight Show At Home" edition was particularly scrutinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.
*   **Intro with Daughters:** Fallon's attempts to make his daughters appear charming in the intro often resulted in them looking miserable, as if subjected to many takes, and being used for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. His children were perceived as unwilling performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.
*   **Editing and Pacing:** The show felt rambley, with noticeable, awkward cuts that didn't improve watchability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>.
*   **Monologue Jokes:** Fallon's delivery of monologue jokes was described as deflating at the punchline, with poor comedic timing and an awkward smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>.
*   **Overall Demeanor:** Fallon appeared sad and unwilling to be doing the show, leading to an unenjoyable viewing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. The show failed to provide escapism from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

## Positive Examples of At-Home Content
Despite the challenges, some celebrities successfully adapted:
*   **John Krasinski** with his "Some Good News" videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>.

*   **Cardi B** was noted for her engaging content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Many celebrities struggled with entertaining alone, often needing help from other creative professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>. The situation highlighted the self-production skills of internet creators compared to traditional media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>. This period offered a humanizing view of celebrity, showing their innate human fallibility, revealing that "celebrities are just like us, kind of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.

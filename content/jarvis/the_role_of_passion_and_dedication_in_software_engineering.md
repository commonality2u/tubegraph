Common advice regarding a career in software engineering often emphasizes the necessity of immense passion and dedication. However, some of this advice is considered misleading or exaggerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Immense Dedication

One piece of advice suggests that programming "requires immense dedication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. However, many software engineers are not "immensely dedicated" to their craft; some simply "work to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## The Role of Passion

Similarly, some sources claim that a career in software engineering "requires passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. While acknowledging that passion might not be present at the start, this view often asserts that it "has to happen somewhere down the road," otherwise individuals will be "mercilessly left behind by those who are" passionate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

It is understood that individuals are "far more willing to invest in something that you're passionate about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. However, many software engineers are not as passionate as some articles suggest, and they still succeed in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Waiting for [[the_importance_of_genuine_passion_in_career_success | passion]] to appear before acting can make it much harder to progress, leading to second-guessing every decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Critiquing the "Toxic" Narrative

Advice that overemphasizes extreme dedication and [[the_importance_of_genuine_passion_in_career_success | passion]] often stems from "survivorship bias" and a "superiority complex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This perspective suggests that "the only way to do it is how I did it and it was pretty hard to do but I'm pretty great so you might not be as good as me tread carefully" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This "toxic bull" can make the industry "uninviting" for individuals who do not fit this specific mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Ultimately, while [[the_importance_of_genuine_passion_in_career_success | passion]] and dedication can be beneficial, they are not universally required to succeed as a software engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Software engineering is often "just a job like any other one with challenging and rewarding parts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

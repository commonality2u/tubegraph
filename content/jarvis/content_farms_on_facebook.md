[[the_business_practices_behind_facebook_meme_pages|Dimmick]] is a Facebook page identified as a [[content_farms_and_their_characteristics|content farm]] due to its high volume of posts and viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It boasts 12 million followers and posts approximately 10 times a day, a practice that has been ongoing for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Content Characteristics
Dimmick describes its mission as creating "the best video content in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. However, its primary content consists of "inspirational/motivational quote memes" that are often confusing, potentially offensive, or lack genuine motivational value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. These memes frequently adopt a bossy or threatening tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

A significant characteristic of Dimmick's [[analysis_of_viral_facebook_content_strategies|content strategy]] is its lack of originality. The memes are not unique to the page and are often direct copies found across the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The writing style suggests the content is created by a non-native English speaker, a common trait in [[content_farms_and_their_characteristics|content farms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

Beyond memes, Dimmick also publishes short videos, which are essentially moving pictures with accompanying text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Examples include:
*   "A blind man's love" story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   A "motivational story" about Colonel Sanders, which is plagiarized and based on a fake viral meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   Random fact and health-related videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Connection to Jersey Dimmick
An investigation into the page revealed a connection to a musician named Jersey Dimmick. The Facebook page's URL is `facebook.com/JerseyDimmick` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, and unrelated music videos by Jersey Dimmick were found in the page's playlists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Facebook's page transparency report indicates that the Dimmick page is managed by seven people in the US and five people in Kosovo, Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. The Jersey Dimmick page is managed by three people in the US, one in India, and five in Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This overlap confirms that the pages are controlled by the same individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, a fact later confirmed by Jersey Dimmick himself via Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Monetization and Scam Practices
Beyond traditional ad revenue, Dimmick attempts to monetize its audience through:
*   **Exclusive content subscriptions**: Priced at $5 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Dimmick Fitness App**: For some strange reason, Dimmick also has a fitness app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
    *   The app has a low rating of two stars on the app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
    *   While free to download, it immediately presents a paywall upon opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
    *   It advertises a 7-day free trial with a yearly subscription, but this is a scam, as users are charged immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
    *   Negative reviews consistently cite being scammed out of money and the non-existent free trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
    *   The developer's email provided for support is non-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
    *   The app's content is minimal, featuring low-quality 3D models demonstrating exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, and advertised features like smoothie recipes are not present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## Critique
The Dimmick operation, including the fitness app, is characterized as a large [[content_farming_and_mass_production_on_youtube|content operation]] that employs at least five people in Kosovo and is actively cheating people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. The core issue is the contradiction between the page's stated goal of creating "the best video content" and its engagement in "sketchy tactics" and outright scamming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. This highlights a broader issue of [[critique_of_content_farms|content farms]] operating with high moral stances while employing deceptive or low-quality practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. While some artists may finance their careers through unconventional means, the Dimmick operation crosses into scamming its audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.

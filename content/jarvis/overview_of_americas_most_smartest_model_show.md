*America's Most Smartest Model* was a reality television show that aired for a single season on VH1, described as MTV backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>. The show's premise questioned whether a "pretty" and "hot, sexy model" could also possess intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. It is likened to a combination of [[comparison_of_americas_most_smartest_model_to_other_reality_shows | America's Next Top Model]] and [[comparison_of_americas_most_smartest_model_to_other_reality_shows | Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader]], albeit without the fifth graders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>.

## Show Format and Challenges
The show features 16 models at various stages of their careers, challenging them to excel in both beauty and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>. Contestants undergo a series of "strange challenges" that merge modeling with trivia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>. Examples include:
*   A spelling bee featuring foreign fashion brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:28">[01:27:28]</a>.
*   A runway walk where contestants must list different types of trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:37">[01:35:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:42">[01:37:42]</a>. This unique combination of modeling and trivia is humorously referred to as "trivia walking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:55">[01:52:55]</a>.
*   Categories for runway walks can vary significantly in difficulty, from naming U.S. states to elements of the periodic table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:30">[02:26:30]</a>.

The ultimate prize for the winner is a modeling campaign with VO5 shampoo and a $100,000 grand prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:36">[05:39:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:42">[05:42:42]</a>.

### House Rules
Upon moving into a shared house, contestants encounter a unique rule: bathrooms and the refrigerator are locked behind trivia questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:07">[12:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:13">[12:10:13]</a>. This is seen as a "human rights violation" but is implied to be fabricated for dramatic effect, as the show would likely not genuinely deprive contestants of necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:17">[12:17:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:28">[12:26:28]</a>.

## Hosts

The show features two main hosts:
*   **Mary Alice Stevenson**: She serves as the "beauty" side of the judging panel and reportedly has "a lot of accolades" in the fashion world, though these are never specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:26">[03:26:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:31">[03:29:31]</a>.
*   **Ben Stein**: Representing the "brains" of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:35">[03:36:35]</a>, Ben Stein is a former economist, speechwriter for Richard Nixon, and actor, famously known for his "boring teacher" role in *Ferris Bueller's Day Off* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:04">[04:02:04]</a>. Despite his intellectual background (valedictorian of Yale Law School, New York Times bestseller), his role on the show is often characterized by "creepy old guy" behavior, constantly fawning over and making inappropriate comments towards female contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:35">[04:33:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:45">[04:42:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:58">[05:17:58]</a>.

## Critiques and Controversies
The show's format and host behavior draw significant criticism, aligning with broader [[critiques_on_reality_tv_show_formats_and_stereotypes | critiques on reality TV show formats and stereotypes]] and the [[negative_portrayal_of_models_and_contestants_in_reality_television | negative portrayal of models and contestants in reality television]].
*   **Mean-spirited Nature**: The challenges often do not genuinely test intelligence but instead "body shame" and "shame their intelligence," making it a "shameful show that's based on being mean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:06">[02:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>. Judges are described as "evil" and aiming to be the "Simon Cowell of the show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:04">[09:06:04]</a>.
*   **Stereotyping**: The show is seen as overusing stereotypes, particularly about models and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:20">[04:20:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:27">[04:25:27]</a>. This includes portraying models as cocky due to producer influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:12">[06:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:24">[06:21:24]</a>.
*   **Ableism**: A contestant with ADHD is consistently edited to appear "off the walls," "unable to stop talking," and "unaware of his surroundings," which is criticized as an unfair and "dumb stereotype" and "a little ableist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:14">[08:13:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:21">[08:21:21]</a>.
*   **Objectification and Misogyny**: The show frequently engages in objectification, particularly concerning female contestants. Ben Stein's behavior exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. One contestant, Mandy Lynn, a former Playboy and lingerie model, is unfairly labeled and treated as a "porn star" by other contestants and the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:38">[10:38:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:51">[10:50:51]</a>. Judges also criticize her walk as "too sexy" or "like she's having sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:17">[18:17:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:32">[18:30:32]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Beauty Standards**: Judges openly body shame contestants, even those with "perfectly normal and beautiful" bodies, perpetuating "unrealistic beauty standards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:21">[09:21:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:43">[09:43:43]</a>.
*   **Lack of Camaraderie**: Unlike shows such as [[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]] where contestants might form bonds despite competition, *America's Most Smartest Model* is characterized by constant cattiness and a lack of community among contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:57">[09:54:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:10">[10:13:10]</a>.
*   **Producer Influence**: It is noted that contestants are often portrayed as "characters in a show" and are not in control of their narrative, with producers heavily influencing their actions and dialogue through editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:03">[16:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:10">[16:07:10]</a>.

## Contestants
Contestants often introduce themselves with both modeling and academic credentials, highlighting the show's focus on blending beauty and brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:02">[07:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:07">[07:05:07]</a>. Notable contestants include:
*   **Andre**: A Russian "bad boy" who takes the show both "too seriously and also not seriously at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:29">[07:27:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:32">[07:32:32]</a>. He famously introduced himself as being from the "Soviet Union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:44">[07:42:44]</a>. Despite his confidence and claims of not needing practice for the runway, he performs poorly in challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.
*   **Gaston**: An Argentinian model who makes inappropriate sexual comments towards women in the house, which producers exploit for "humor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:48">[15:47:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:22">[16:22:22]</a>. He is eliminated after the first challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:05">[22:04:05]</a>.
*   **Mandy Lynn**: A former Playboy and lingerie model who faces constant shaming and objectification from hosts and fellow contestants, often being labeled a "porn star" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:38">[10:38:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:40">[10:40:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:47">[10:44:47]</a>. She attempts to dress more conservatively to appease hosts but is still criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:06">[17:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:14">[17:11:14]</a>.

## Elimination Process
Two contestants are eliminated early in the first episode without clear justification, suggesting a deliberate attempt to break down self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:44">[11:46:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:56">[11:54:56]</a>. After the first challenge (the runway walk), Gaston and another contestant named Victoria are eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:05">[22:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:10">[22:10:10]</a>. The hosts often dramatize saving contestants, particularly Mandy Lynn, by implying they put their "credibility on the line" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:28">[22:28:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:32">[22:30:32]</a>.

## Overall Impression
The show is characterized as "really mean" and indicative of early 2000s reality television, where anything could be said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>. Despite its perceived awfulness, it is considered "fun to watch because it's so horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:03">[23:00:03]</a>.

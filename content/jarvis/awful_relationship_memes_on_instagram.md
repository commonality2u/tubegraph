The topic of awful romance and heartbreak memes from Instagram was revisited by the host, Jarvis, who previously made a video about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. While isolated with his girlfriend during quarantine, Jarvis decided to "corrupt" her with these "horrific memes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His girlfriend noted that Instagram likely suggests this type of content to him because he talks about "this garbage" too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## General Observations on the Memes

The memes are consistently described as "cringey" and "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Many of them include typos that are easy to catch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. A recurring critique is that the dialogue in the memes does not resemble how two people would genuinely converse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Specific Meme Examples

### "I'll be your sanitizer"
This meme features the text:
> "It's the Internet in a world full of not saying that I'll be your sanitizer winky face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>

Jarvis remarked that he ran out of sanitizer but had a girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### "Relationships are harder now"
This meme attributes relationship difficulties to modern communication:
> "Relationships are harder now now because conversations became texting arguments became phone calls feelings became subliminal messages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
> "being hurt became natural and leaving became the only option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
> "so if you have something that's worth it don't take it for granted fight for it and don't let it go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
> "too late she's not the same anymore at all I don't know her and I really don't want to know her anymore sadly broken heart emoji and then a woman with baby emoji" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>

The speaker questioned the logic, suggesting that arguments becoming phone calls sounded positive, while conversations becoming texting implies a loss of real conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### "Attention all females read this"
This meme, appearing as a bulletin board with guitar lessons advertised, states:
> "You'll never see women arguing or fighting over a good man a good man won't put you in the position of not knowing where you stand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>

### "Being a girlfriend"
This meme outlined a strict set of rules for being a girlfriend:
> "Being a girlfriend is more than changing his contact from crush to love of my life lol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
> "being a girlfriend means you're there emotionally physical and spiritually for your significant other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>
> "being a girlfriend means you'll be loyal to that person and love them unconditionally and learn to accept their flaws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>

The speaker's girlfriend noted, "there's so many rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### "I miss you like hell"
This meme describes the pain of blocking someone:
> "I miss you like hell I'm dying every second this pain is unbearable but the problem is I can't even unblock you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
> "I'm afraid if I do that I wouldn't be able to move away again from you and have to shed tears every day from taking this decision again I cannot block you cuz I'm just gonna keep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>

Jarvis's girlfriend commented that it "sounds like weak people making excuses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### "I want to feel you today"
This meme depicts a misunderstanding in conversation:
> "baby are you in a good mood today Yes why you're asking like this I want to feel you today Oh I got it you want to have sex right no I want to cuddle you tight and stand in the balcony of ours with one warm blanket covering us with a one cup of coffee we sipping together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>

The speaker noted the meme was "kind of sweet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> and highlighted its relevance to the quarantine period, as it was posted on March 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### "If a girl is silent it's dangerous"
This meme suggests various reasons for a girl's silence:
> "if a girl is silent it's dangerous she's either overthinking tired of waiting about to blow up needs a hug falling apart crying inside all of the above" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>

Jarvis's girlfriend suggested that if one needs a hug, they should "just ask" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### "Safe sex"
This meme plays on the phrase "safe sex":
> "safe sex if you're gonna make love with the person whom you love so much, do it wearing the safest thing what's that safest thing the wedding ring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>

The speaker found it odd that this meme, like many others, rhymed, and questioned its realism as a conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This contributes to the [[Critique of online relationship advice | critique of online relationship advice]] and [[Misguided relationship goals and expectations | misguided relationship goals and expectations]] often found in these formats.

### "You won't receive one one day"
This meme features a threatening image and text about ignored messages:
> "you can ring my messages don't worry you won't receive one one day presumably because I don't have service it seems to me you don't want to talk to me so one day I will actually take your silence eventually but for now I'm just gonna continue texting you while you're ignoring me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>

Both speakers found the sentiment to be unhealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### "Liar liar"
This meme, showing two people on a moped, states:
> "liar liar because you should have said the more intense one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>

The speaker noted it was "not the time to have such an intense conversation while you're on a moped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### "Too much trust sometimes kills you"
This meme depicts a person shooting another in the back with an arrow:
> "too much trust sometimes kills you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>

The speaker found the image and message "so messed up" and asserted that people should trust each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### "When a boy cries for a girl"
This meme makes a grand statement about a boy's love:
> "boy cries when a boy cries for a girl no one can love her more than him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>
> "when a boy cries for a girl no one can love her more than him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>

Jarvis expressed that he loves when guys cry for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### "I love you to prove it scream it to the world"
This meme portrays a quiet declaration of love:
> "I love you I love you to prove it scream it to the world whispers in ear it's not these aren't staged erection take this whispers in ear I love you why did you whisper to me because you're my world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>

### "Morning face more than your party look"
This meme expresses a preference for a natural appearance:
> "I love your morning face more than your party look can you take off all that you did in the bathroom for 30 minutes please yeah bring back the morning face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>

### "Main reason behind most of the break-up"
This meme simplifies the cause of breakups:
> "the main reason behind most of the break-up is I still love him she doesn't loves me misunderstanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>

The speaker conceded it was "kind of true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### "Donate your old toys to poor kids"
This meme uses a controversial metaphor for moving on from an ex:
> "don't be sad when you see your ex with someone else learn to donate your old toys to poor kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>

The speakers heavily criticized this, interpreting it as "you're an object that I used to play with for pleasure and now I'm donating you the object to a child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The accompanying image of two boys, one looking displeased, added to the problematic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### "If she is not texting you first"
This meme also contained an aggressive image and message:
> "also if she is not texting you first she doesn't want you to talk to her stop texting her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>

## Conclusion
Reviewing these memes left Jarvis's girlfriend feeling "stupider" and predicted she would "be a worse girlfriend" as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The experience highlighted the often [[portrayal_of_relationships_on_social_media | misguided portrayal of relationships on social media]] and the [[effects_of_social_media_on_relationships | effects of social media on relationships]] through this type of content.

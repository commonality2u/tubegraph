BuzzFeed, as a website, deals exclusively in trending topics, offering content that can range from "completely horrific" news, such as recent earthquakes, to "so cute" videos like Japanese millennials reviewing instant noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Conveniently located next to the news section, BuzzFeed also features quizzes, which are presented as being of equal importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Characteristics and Evolution

BuzzFeed quizzes are described as "life changing" by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, despite often revealing information that might already be known, such as one's current mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, or speculative details like the number of children one will have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, or even "inner Lacroix flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

Early encounters with these quizzes, possibly around ten years ago, were often via Facebook feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>, serving as a break from activities like tending to farms on Farmville or viewing party photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. In their early form, the quizzes were "pointless" but straightforward, such as "What Harry Potter character are you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. This represents an aspect of the [[history_of_buzzfeed_quizzes]].

More recently, quizzes have become "really Weird and Specific" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Many now demand a task be completed before providing information the user likely already possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Examples of Modern Quizzes and Critiques

### Shopping Challenges

A notable example involves a "[[shopping_challenges_inspired_by_social_media | shopping challenge]]": "Shop at Victoria's Secret and we'll give you an Ariana Grande song to listen to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This is criticized as an unfair trade, requiring significant shopping effort for a single, easily accessible song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Challenging Intelligence

Some quizzes aim to "challenge your intelligence," such as "We bet you haven't tried at least half of the cheeses on this list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. The premise is questioned, as it's unlikely anyone knows "every cheese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

### "Frightening Accuracy" Quizzes

Another type claims "frightening accuracy" in guessing age, like "Plan a movie night and we'll guess your age with Frightening Accuracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Users are asked a series of personal questions about movie night plans, including guests, drinks, and movies, leading to a potentially "frightening" age reveal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

### Quizzes with Questionable Titles

Some quiz titles express doubt about their own accuracy, such as "It'll be a miracle if we can guess your age based on your dessert preferences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, indicating a lack of confidence in the quiz's ability to deliver on its promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Others make obvious statements, like "If you have a lot of random knowledge, this quiz will be easy for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

## The "Love Poo" Quiz

One specific quiz, "This yes or no quiz will tell us if you love poo," served as inspiration for a video discussing [[the_appeal_and_criticism_of_buzzfeed_quizzes | BuzzFeed quizzes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. The quiz, authored by BuzzFeed staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>, is ironically critiqued for its subject matter and the unnecessary depth of its questions.

Key questions from this quiz include:
*   "Do you feel sad when you can't go?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>
*   "Do you ever feel genuinely happy when you have a big poo?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>
*   "Do you ever look back at who you've just done and think wow?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>
*   "Do you often feel lighter when you go for a poo?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>
*   "Do you ever text or send selfies while you poo?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a> (This question is accompanied by discussion of strange stock photos, such as "Smiling young man taking selfie with cell phone while defecating in his bathroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>).
*   "Do you ever announce that you're going for a shit in front of a group of people?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>
*   "Do you talk to your friends about pooping?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>
*   "Do you have a daily regimen that you enjoy sticking to and documenting?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>
*   "Do you own anything poop themed?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>

The quiz concludes with the result "I don't love poo," publicly announced despite the personal nature of the questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. The overall experience of taking such a quiz highlights elements of [[humor_in_buzzfeed_quizzes]].

## Business Model and Cultural Impact

In a satirical restaurant setting, "quiz callers" are depicted as the "cooks" of "Buzz Feedâ„¢" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. They are portrayed as harmless, working for free, often being "bored college students" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. This setup, although metaphorical, implies that relying on free or cheap labor for content creation is essential for businesses to stay afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. This could be seen as a commentary on practices akin to [[content_farms_on_facebook]] or [[content_farms_on_youtube]].

While the video initially intended to discuss more substantial topics like BuzzFeed's layoffs of writing staff or how a significant portion of quiz traffic came from a single college student, it ultimately focused on the peculiar nature of the quizzes themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. Nonetheless, the wide reach and unusual content of these quizzes demonstrate aspects of [[buzzfeeds_cultural_impact]].

Deep fakes are a form of synthetic media where a person in an existing image or video has their likeness replaced with someone else's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) and requires a significant amount of reference material, such as photographs and videos, of the person being deep faked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Celebrities, like Tom Cruise, are often easier to deep fake due to the abundance of available images and video footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

## How Deep Fake Technology Works

The core of [[Understanding Deep Fakes | deep fake]] technology relies on AI to analyze and synthesize the target person's likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. For a realistic deep fake, a large number of images of the target person from various angles and vantage points are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. The AI uses this data to map the new face onto the existing footage seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

The process for high-quality deep fakes can be extensive, taking months to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. For instance, artist Chris Ume, who created the viral "Deep Tom Cruise" TikTok videos, hired a professional Tom Cruise impersonator to act as the base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. This allowed for precise movements and expressions that the AI could then transform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. However, while high-effort deep fakes exist, convincing ones can also be created with fewer resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

### Audio Deep Fakes

In addition to visual deep fakes, there is also technology for creating deep fakes for audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. When combined with video deep fakes, this audio technology makes it increasingly difficult to discern what is real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

## Notable Examples and Applications

*   **Viral Tom Cruise Deep Fake (TikTok)**: A series of videos featuring a deep fake of Tom Cruise went viral on TikTok, showcasing the technology's ability to create convincing, albeit sometimes strange, content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The TikTok account that posted these videos, "deep tom cruise," explicitly indicated they were deep fakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. These were created by Chris Ume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   **Harry Styles Deep Fake Sketch**: Another lighthearted example is a TikTok sketch featuring a deep fake of Harry Styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Jarvis Johnson / Hardrock Nick Deep Fake**: An example of a "horrifying" deep fake was the face of Hardrock Nick placed onto the body of the video's presenter, Jarvis Johnson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Jordan Peele Obama Deep Fake**: This well-known example demonstrated the capability of deep fake technology by placing Barack Obama's likeness onto Jordan Peele <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
*   **Bill Hader Deep Fake (Control Shift Face)**: A video from the YouTube channel "Control Shift Face" seamlessly transformed Bill Hader's face into those of celebrities like Tom Cruise, Seth Rogen, and Arnold Schwarzenegger as he impersonated them while telling a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. This video went viral two years prior to the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

## Risks and Societal Concerns

While some deep fakes are used for entertainment, the technology carries significant [[risks_and_concerns_of_deep_fake_usage | risks and concerns of deep fake usage]]. Historically, deep fakes have been used for "bad reasons," such as placing someone's likeness into lewd videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### Real-World Misuse

A notable real-world incident involved a Pennsylvania woman accused of doctoring photos and videos of her daughter's cheerleading rivals to get them removed from the squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. This resulted in three misdemeanor counts of cyber harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

### Privacy Implications

[[Tactics and implications of creating fake online personas | Creating fake online personas]] or deep fakes of individuals, especially minors like Charlie D'Amelio, without consent, is considered a breach of privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. TikTok has policies to remove such content when creators attempt to impersonate individuals without making it clear it's a deep fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.

### The Challenge of Verification

The pervasive nature of deep fakes contributes to [[impact_of_fake_stories_on_youtube | fake news]] by preying on people's inability to critically assess every piece of information they encounter online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. An individual might accept a deep fake as real if it aligns with their existing worldview, especially if they are scrolling quickly and the video plays without audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.

This makes it an "impossible task" for every individual to determine the authenticity of everything they see online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. As [[regulation and ethical implications of deep fakes | deep fake technology]] becomes more accessible, general societal awareness of its capabilities is crucial to avoid being tricked or influenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>.

From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The YouTube channel [[the_fake_nature_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] presents itself as featuring "completely truthful stories" submitted by kids, despite evidence suggesting otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This analysis critiques the channel's deceptive practices, [[criticism_of_sensationalist_content_on_youtube | sensationalist content]], and the overall lack of authenticity in its [[critique_of_animated_story_channels | animated stories]].

## Core Criticisms
The primary criticism against [[the_fake_nature_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] is its misleading claim that its stories are true. Despite requiring scripts to have "believability" and "sound like they're told by a real teenager," the content consistently features [[criticism_of_fake_animated_stories_on_youtube | fake]] and often incoherent narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The channel is known for its "extremely clickbait stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Examples of Questionable Stories

### "I faked pregnancy to get good grades" / "What spoiled yogurt made me the most popular person in school"
This story, featuring a 14-year-old named Nancy, is presented with multiple, changing clickbait titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The narrative centers on Nancy drinking spoiled yogurt, leading to her getting sick during a presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Her friend Angela then accidentally reads a WebMD article about pregnancy that was mixed into Nancy's presentation papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This leads the entire school to believe Nancy is pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Nancy then intentionally fakes pregnancy to receive special treatment and good grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Even when a social worker and police get involved, Nancy faces "no consequences" for her lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The story is criticized for being incoherent and nonsensical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### "I was trapped in a house with five burglars"
Originally titled "I was trapped in a house with five burglars," this story also changed its titles to "I risked my life to save my neighbors but it didn't help" and "I thought I was smarter than burglars but then I got trapped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The protagonist, Carla, a 14-year-old dog walker, enters her neighbors' burgled house to call the police, despite having no phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Inside, she finds a dead landline and later discovers a smartphone, which she uses to call her mom in Spanish to alert the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The story is mocked for its illogical plot points, such as the thieves cutting the phone line but leaving a smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Carla's actions are deemed "stupid" and an "unnecessary risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### "My friends think I'm dead"
This video tells the story of a kid whose father commits an "unnamed crime," forcing the family into witness protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. The story is heavily criticized for its lack of details, which the narrator claims are "secret for safety reasons," despite sharing the story with "millions of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. The most significant falsehood is the claim that the family had to fake their death and that there was a news story about them dying in a car crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. This is explicitly stated to be untrue for witness protection programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. The story's vagueness and fabricated details highlight the channel's broader issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## Channel Practices and Formulaic Content
The channel's stories often follow a specific formula designed to create [[criticism_of_sensationalist_content_on_youtube | clickbait]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>:
*   **First-person narrative**: Starting with "I" or "my" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Relatable character**: Often involving the protagonist, their mom, dad, or crush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Negative event**: Focusing on themes of death, crime, betrayal, or emotional manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

The consistent use of the same narrator for every video also raises questions about the authenticity of diverse "user-submitted" stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Parody and Algorithmic Generation
As a form of [[criticism_of_fake_animated_stories_on_youtube | critique]], a parody [[critique_of_animated_story_channels | animated story channel]] called "They Actually Animated My Story" was created, demonstrating how easily such [[criticism_of_lowquality_content_on_youtube_channels | fake]] narratives can be replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This parody channel, despite its fictional content, gained significant subscribers and views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Furthermore, an attempt was made to teach an AI (using Markov chains and GPT-2) to generate [[the_fake_nature_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]]-style titles and scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. This experiment successfully produced titles that mimicked the channel's style, such as "My dad became an Instagram star overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, reinforcing the formulaic nature of [[the_fake_nature_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]]'s content.

## Conclusion
The analysis concludes that [[the_fake_nature_of_the_youtube_channel_actually_happened | Actually Happened]] is a purveyor of [[criticism_of_fake_animated_stories_on_youtube | fake animated stories]] that employ [[criticism_of_sensationalist_content_on_youtube | sensationalist content]] and [[criticism_of_lowquality_content_on_youtube_channels | low-quality content]] for views. The overarching message is to be "dubious of anything that purports to be real on the Internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

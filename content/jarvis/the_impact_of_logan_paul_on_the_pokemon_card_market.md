The YouTube personality [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul's interest in Pokemon cards]] has significantly influenced the Pokemon card market, leading to an increase in card values and inspiring new collectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Logan Paul's Entry into Pokemon Card Collecting
[[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]] became deeply involved in Pokemon cards, purchasing a first edition base set box for approximately $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. He created several videos documenting his journey, which were described as "endearing and entertaining" due to his clear enjoyment and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

He notably opened these cards on a live stream, selling all the packs and generating around $400,000, with over $100,000 donated to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## The "Logan Paul Effect"
Following [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul's]] highly publicized activities, the prices of Pokemon cards experienced a significant surge, reaching an all-time high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This rise in value also inspired many individuals, including those with little to no prior knowledge of Pokemon, to enter the collecting market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## Contrast with [[the_incident_involving_dumb_money_and_fake_pokemon_cards | The "Dumb Money" Incident]]
The impact of [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul's]] success led a group of investors with a YouTube channel called "Dumb Money" to attempt a similar high-value Pokemon card purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. This group, who admitted to knowing "absolutely nothing" about Pokemon, aimed to purchase the world's most expensive first edition box for $375,000 as a stunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

They intended to buy the cards from the same collector who had sold graded cards to [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This collector is known as [[collectibles_guru_and_his_role_in_the_pokemon_card_controversy | Collectibles Guru]], also referred to as "the Crypto King" from the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

> [!info] The Difference
> While [[collectibles_guru_and_his_role_in_the_pokemon_card_controversy | Collectibles Guru]] sold legitimate graded cards to [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]], [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]] himself acquired his initial first edition booster box at an auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with [[the_incident_involving_dumb_money_and_fake_pokemon_cards | the "Dumb Money" incident]], where the box sold by Guru was found to be resealed with modern cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>.

The "Dumb Money" group's attempt to emulate [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]] lacked the "heart" and nostalgia that characterized [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul's]] venture, appearing purely as an investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Their stream aimed to double [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul's]] achievements, planning to pay nearly double for a box and donate significantly more to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. However, the transaction was widely criticized in the chat as a potential scam, and the box was indeed found to be fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

## Market Reactions and Skepticism
The Pokemon community, including those participating in the live chat of the "Dumb Money" stream, expressed immediate skepticism towards [[collectibles_guru_and_his_role_in_the_pokemon_card_controversy | Collectibles Guru's]] credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. Despite [[collectibles_guru_and_his_role_in_the_pokemon_card_controversy | Guru's]] successful sale of legitimate product to [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]], some prior incidents, such as his reference to a "drug deal" when meeting [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]] and his inflated valuation of a Bulbasaur card, had already raised concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

Ultimately, while the "Dumb Money" investors were able to secure a legitimate box in a subsequent transaction, the initial incident highlighted the risks of high-value collectible markets, especially for newcomers inspired by influencers like [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]] without sufficient expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>. The situation led to significant public discussion about [[scamming_in_highvalue_pokemon_card_transactions | scamming in high-value Pokemon card transactions]] and the rapid inflation of prices due to new interest.

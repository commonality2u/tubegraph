Mobile gaming is plagued by a pervasive issue of "very bad ads for very bad mobile games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. These advertisements often utilize aggressive [[ad_targeting_for_mobile_games | ad targeting]], sometimes even deducing personal details like age, relationship status, location, and viewing habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Absurd and Misleading Ad Scenarios

Many mobile game ads present bizarre or nonsensical scenarios that often bear little resemblance to the actual gameplay.

### The "Prison Break" Word Game
One example is an ad for a prison-themed word game where the goal is to break out of prison using words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   The art style of the ad strongly resembles the webcomic "Cyanide and Happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   A loved one attempts to smuggle the prisoner out in a human-sized sack, which then breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   To escape a situation, a word box appears, requiring the player to spell a word, after which a giant suitcase falls from the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   In one instance, escaping prison only required spelling "Bone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The ad also depicts scenarios where the only possible word from given letters is the nonsensical "Bneo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### [[interactive_story_mobile_game_ads | Interactive Story Mobile Game Ads]]
Games like "Choices," "Episode," and "Chapter" are competitors in the [[interactive_story_mobile_game_ads | interactive story game]] genre, all sharing similar names and absurd ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Players often submit stories where important choices are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Themes:** These stories predominantly revolve around themes of sex, cheating, and pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Absurd Choices:** Ads showcase choices such as "hide under the bed" or "maybe she can join us" when a girlfriend arrives unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Confusing Scenarios:**
    *   An ad for "Chapters" shows confusing emojis like eggplants, water droplets, a cat, a chick, and words like "Time," "Hotel," and "Bikini" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. It then implies "thirst texting" an ex with "sex" as the first word while with another person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   An "Episode" ad features a dilemma between "kiss him" or "pull him into the water" with an attractive man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Pulling him in leads to drowning in waist-deep water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, followed by options "Oops!" or "Save him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, and then "give him CPR" or "call a doctor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The man is revealed to be faking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Dramatic Betrayal:** Ads often depict extreme drama, such as a man with a pregnant wife and a pregnant girlfriend who are unaware of each other until they meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This scenario, despite its high risk, is presented as if the "bad man wins for no reason whatsoever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Repetitive Dialogue:** Ads can feature repetitive or exposition-heavy dialogue, mimicking soap operas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The phrase "Get away from my wife!" is used nonsensically in different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Ads Designed to Provoke Negative Feelings
Some mobile game ads aim to make viewers "feel bad about myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   Captions like "Real men, don't get wet?" or "I never knew anxiety until I played this" are used, even when they don't logically apply to the game footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   Other jarring phrases include "How many neurons can you break?" and "This game will ruin your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. These seem to be random phrases applied to random games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Voodoo: The Company Behind Many Misleading Ads
The French app developer Voodoo is identified as being behind many of these unusual advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Practices:** Voodoo is suspected of being both game developers and the creators of these strange text captions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. They are a large game publisher on iOS and Android, often accused of copying other people's games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Funding:** Voodoo received a $200 million investment from Goldman Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Nonsensical Slogans:** Their ads feature phrases like "From two to 31 inches caliber," "Only left-brain people can reach the pink color," and incorporate elements like the "Attack on Titan" theme song or floating dollar bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### The Facebook Ad Library
The Facebook Ad Library, launched to add transparency in advertising, allows users to search active ads on Instagram and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Voodoo's Scale:** A search for Voodoo reveals over 8,000 ad campaigns running in the US alone, suggesting they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly on ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **"Shotgun Approach":** The sheer volume and variety of ads suggest a "shotgun approach" where Voodoo experiments by pairing random text captions with random gameplay videos to see what performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Obsessions:** Voodoo's ads show a strange obsession with phrases like "reaching Japan" and "pink color," appearing across multiple campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### The "Worst Mobile Game Ad of All Time"
By examining discontinued ads in the Facebook Ad Library, a particularly egregious example was found: an ad for a game where players "unlock all the weapons by nuking planets" featuring footage of bombs dropping on Earth and including Kim Jong Un in the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Broader Concerns with Mobile Gaming Ads and Privacy
The nature of these ads highlights broader concerns regarding [[ad_targeting_for_mobile_games | ad targeting]] and [[privacy_and_data_protection_in_mobile_gaming | privacy and data protection in mobile gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   Mobile games can track user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   In the US, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can legally sell browsing history to advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

### Protecting Privacy Online
One of the most important ways to protect online privacy is by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   VPNs create a secure tunnel between a device and a website, preventing others from seeing traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   They can also change a user's apparent location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   It is advised not to use free, unsecured Wi-Fi unless the source is trusted, due to the risk of data interception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

The **Maury** show has been a fixture on daytime television for decades, with its continuous run since 1991. The speaker recalls watching the show during elementary school, around 2 p.m., as their mother, who had a disability, would often have daytime television on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This early exposure included soap operas, game shows, and daytime talk shows, specifically *Maury* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The speaker also recalls watching [[jerry_springer_and_his_talk_show_controversies | Jerry Springer]], noting that both shows featured "a lot of yelling, a lot of paternity testing, a lot of manila envelopes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The speaker was surprised to learn that *Maury* is still airing, especially since its host, Maury Povich, is 82 years old and continues to do the same things he did 30 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This observation prompts a [[continuing_popularity_of_maury_povichs_show | deeper look]] into the show's format, comparing its past and modern iterations.

## Past Show Format (Childhood Era)

From the speaker's childhood memories, the *Maury* show, much like [[jerry_springer_and_his_talk_show_controversies | Jerry Springer]], prominently featured:
*   **Paternity Focus**: The show was primarily a "paternity program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, often centered around determining fatherhood.
*   **Audience Involvement**: The audience played a significant role, with applause and boos that sometimes felt rehearsed, suggesting cues were given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   **On-stage Conflict**: There was a notable amount of fighting among guests on stage, necessitating the presence of security guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. The speaker described this as feeling "very exploitative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   **Lie Detector Tests**: These were a common element, perhaps even popularized by such shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   **Dramatic Reveals**: Manila envelopes were used for the reveal of paternity results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Intros**: Stories often began with highly aggressive introductions, setting a confrontational tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Instigation**: Maury Povich himself was perceived as an "instigator" rather than a mediator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>, often pressing for "grimy dirty piggy details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Manipulation**: The show often used emotional tactics, such as displaying images of children to evoke sympathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

The speaker points out that some segments, despite recent uploads to YouTube, might be older, possibly from the time of *Transformers 2* (2009), as indicated by a "#viralvault" hashtag on Maury's social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. This suggests that while the show was still running, some clips are from a prior period.

## Modern Show Format (Pandemic Era)

When comparing to a more recent clip from 2020 during the pandemic, referred to as "Modern Maury" or "Maudern" Maury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>, the speaker notes some key differences and continuities:
*   **Virtual Presence**: Due to the pandemic, there is "no live studio audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>. Instead, guests appear on "screens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>, with Maury Povich panning back and forth between these screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>.
*   **Continued Focus**: The show still largely revolves around paternity tests and the "who or who is not the father" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Questioning**: Maury Povich continues to be confrontational, immediately stating things like "You're angry, you're angry and you're mad" to guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>.
*   **Manila Envelopes**: Despite the virtual format, the dramatic reveal of results via manila envelopes remains a staple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.
*   **Stereotype Exploitation**: The show continues to "prey on the stereotype of the absent father" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.
*   **"Free DNA Tests"**: The show advertises "free DNA tests" as a way to attract guests, implying participation on the show is part of the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.

> "Maury, you could say the same about you kind of making profit out of buying people 200 DNA tests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>

## Conclusion

The speaker concludes that the core format of *Maury* "has not changed in the past, I don't know, 20 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>, despite minor adaptations like the use of screens during the pandemic. The fundamental approach of the show, which involves exacerbating interpersonal conflicts rather than helping resolve them, remains consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>. The speaker notes the irony that resolving such issues through a show like *Maury* likely takes more time and effort than resolving them privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>. Ultimately, the speaker views the show as "dumb" and "stupid" for its continued existence and problematic format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:00">[27:14:00]</a>.

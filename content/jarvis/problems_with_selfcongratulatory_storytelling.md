This article explores the issues arising from user-submitted, supposedly real stories that often serve as platforms for authors to portray themselves as heroes, particularly as seen in "Not Always Right Comics." These narratives, while claiming to be authentic, frequently feature exaggerated scenarios and illogical character behaviors, raising questions about their veracity and impact.

## "Not Always Right Comics" Overview
"Not Always Right Comics" is an Instagram page that combines the format of [[critique_of_fake_animated_stories | fake animated stories claiming to be real]] with webcomics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It appears to be an offshoot of the "Not Always Right" website, which has existed since at least 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The website provides a platform for people to submit stories complaining about others in their lives who are "not always right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Most stories involve individuals working service jobs, dealing with rude or mean customers or parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## The Self-Congratulatory Nature
While these stories claim to be real and user-submitted, they often read as narratives where the author emerges as the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The stories are frequently "self-congratulatory" and seem designed primarily for the author to "pat themselves on the back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This often results in a "wish fulfillment" scenario for service workers who might not be able to confront customers in real life without risking their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

## Narrative Tropes and Unbelievable Scenarios
The comics almost exclusively feature a protagonist who "owns" an "entitled parent or customer" or someone else "in the wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. These stories often rely on highly improbable situations and caricatured antagonists. This makes them predictable and silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Example Stories:

#### The Tattoo Story
A story about a school worker with an ivy vine tattoo on their foot depicts a "Karen" character who judges the tattoo as a "gang symbol" or drug-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The story culminates in a "plot twist" where the judgmental parent is revealed to have a "tramp stamp" tattoo, implying hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The narrative then shifts to [[judgment_and_hypocrisy_in_social_narratives | slut-shaming]] the "Karen's" tattoo, positioning the narrator as the "moral victor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The setup is considered unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

#### The Hawaii Tourist Story
Another comic features a tourist in Hawaii who speaks English but pretends not to understand "Aloha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The tourist then asks if they take "American money" and claims not to know about currency exchange, despite being in a U.S. state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This scenario is deemed unbelievable, as someone with knowledge of currency exchange and customs would likely know Hawaii is part of the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. While aiming to take down bigotry, the story's unbelievable nature undercuts its [[moral_lessons_and_storytelling_techniques | point]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

#### The Velcro Wall Story
This comic involves an entitled parent insisting their child ride a "velcro wall" despite insufficient time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The dialogue is confusing, with odd word choices like "our troop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The parent leaves and returns after the "ride" closes, still demanding access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The story ends with the employee directing the parent to a "clown" who is actually their boss, a misdirection that "owns" the clown instead of the parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

#### Tech Support Stories
A subsection of "Not Always Right Comics" focuses on tech support, portraying customers as "unreasonable and stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Sexist Customer:** One comic features a sexist man who refuses to talk to a female tech support representative, only to find she is the only one who can help him, resulting in her "owning" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Train Internet:** Another involves a businessman on a train demanding internet service despite being in a maintenance zone, expecting the tech support to "move the satellite" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The employee "owns" him by having him wait for the maintenance zone to pass, which takes the exact amount of time he would have needed to wait anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This story contains factual inaccuracies about train schedules and cell service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Homophobic Customer:** A customer seeking to connect an iPod to a stereo reacts with disgust when the tech support asks for a "male to male" cable, misinterpreting it as "boy to boy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The tech support hangs up on him, "showing him he's bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

#### The DVD Player Porn Story
This comic, despite being published in late 2019, features a customer trying to get a DVD player serviced in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. The problem is revealed to be a DVD inserted upside down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. The employee plugs the customer's DVD player into the "entire store system," which then blasts a "grotesque scene of a cheesy porn" throughout the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. The story's premise and execution are deemed unbelievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

## Conclusion on Authenticity and [[storytelling_and_narrative_styles_in_viral_content | Narrative Style]]
The comics' intentions may be good, aiming to highlight disrespect faced by service workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. However, their reliance on unbelievable scenarios and exaggerated character behaviors ultimately makes them "goofy as hell" and undermines their desired effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. The fundamental issue is the insistence that these stories are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. While fictional stories are perfectly acceptable and can be compelling, claiming fabricated stories are true is problematic and contributes to the [[impact_of_fabricated_stories_on_audience_perceptions | impact of fabricated stories on audience perceptions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. The video suggests that [[narrative_analysis_of_fake_stories | the problems with video scripting and storytelling]] in these comics also extend to their underlying messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

In a period referred to as "the end times" where one is unable to leave their house, digital connections become a primary means of interaction and maintaining well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Adhering to social distancing guidelines, such as staying put and avoiding physical gatherings, is emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Navigating Social Distancing

The inability to leave home due to a pandemic leads to feelings of boredom and loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While the desire to have friends over for filming exists, it's deemed irresponsible given the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This highlights the [[public_health_risks_of_gatherings_during_covid19 | public health risks of gatherings during COVID19]] during a pandemic. Even when permitted to go outside for fresh air, individuals are advised to "stay six feet away from other humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Utilizing Digital Tools for Connection

In lieu of in-person interactions, [[digital_connections_and_social_distancing | digital connections]] become essential:

*   **Learning Languages** Apps like Duolingo allow individuals to teach themselves a foreign language, such as brushing up on Japanese skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Reflections on Pandemic Pressure

Despite the numerous activities, finding a new hobby remains elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. There's a perceived pressure from the internet to "suddenly become the best versions of ourselves" and "not waste any of this extra time" during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. However, it's suggested that this pressure is "silly," and individuals should prioritize doing "whatever you need to do to like make it through this very weird period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The focus should be on chilling, enjoying oneself, and spending time digitally with loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

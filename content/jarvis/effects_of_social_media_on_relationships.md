Social media platforms, particularly Instagram, have significantly influenced the [[portrayal_of_relationships_on_social_media | portrayal of relationships on social media]] and shaped contemporary views on romance and heartbreak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The content algorithms on these platforms can lead to a continuous exposure to specific types of relationship-related "garbage" once a user engages with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Communication Shifts

One common [[critique_of_online_relationship_advice | critique of online relationship advice]] found in memes is that relationships have become more challenging because communication has evolved:
*   Conversations have shifted to texting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Arguments have become phone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Feelings are often conveyed through subliminal messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

This change in communication methods is perceived by some as leading to a state where "being hurt became natural and leaving became the only option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Unsolicited Advice and Expectations

Social media is a common source of unsolicited relationship advice and definitions of relationship roles. Examples include:
*   **On Men:** "You'll never see women arguing or fighting over a good man. A good man won't put you in the position of not knowing where you stand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **On Girlfriends:** "Being a girlfriend is more than changing his contact from crush to love of my life lol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. It supposedly entails being "emotionally physical and spiritually" present, demonstrating unconditional loyalty and love, and accepting flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. These "rules" for being a girlfriend are perceived as burdensome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **On Silent Partners:** If a girl is silent, it's suggested she might be "overthinking, tired of waiting, about to blow up, needs a hug, falling apart, [or] crying inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Portrayals of Love and Breakups

Social media content often presents idealized or dramatic scenarios of love and heartbreak:
*   **Idealized Love:** A meme suggests that the "safest thing" to wear when making love is a wedding ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, promoting marriage as the ultimate form of commitment in intimate relationships. Another romanticizes "morning face" over a "party look" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Dramatic Expressions:** Some memes depict extreme emotional states, such as a person dying every second from unbearable pain after blocking someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, or a boy crying for a girl as proof that "no one can love her more than him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Breakup Narratives:** The main reason behind most breakups is attributed to "misunderstanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. An analogy for moving on suggests donating an ex ("old toys") to "poor kids" (a new partner) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, objectifying past partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Impact on Trust and Communication

The [[influence_of_social_media_on_modern_dating_culture | influence of social media on modern dating culture]] can lead to negative interpretations of silence and communication patterns:
*   Ignoring messages can be seen as a sign that someone "don't want to talk to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   A meme suggests that if a person "is not texting you first she doesn't want you to talk to her stop texting her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   "Too much trust sometimes kills you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, implying that trust can be dangerous in relationships, though this statement is broadly questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Ultimately, exposure to such content can lead to a feeling of becoming "stupider" and potentially a "worse girlfriend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, suggesting a negative [[critique_of_online_relationship_advice | impact of online relationship advice]] on personal perception and relationship dynamics.

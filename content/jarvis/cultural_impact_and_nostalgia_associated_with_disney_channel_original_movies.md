*   **Characters and Tropes**: The film's depiction of Ben Cooper as a "sweepstakes addict slash stay-at-home son" who takes on a "maternal role" is a point of discussion, especially his antiquated views on gender roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **Unexpectedly Dark Themes**: The shift of *Smart House* into "horror movie" territory as the house's AI, Pat, becomes overprotective and authoritarian, surprising viewers with "random war imagery and like nuclear explosion videos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>. These scenes "scarred" many viewers, highlighting the unexpected depth and occasionally disturbing content found in DCOMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.

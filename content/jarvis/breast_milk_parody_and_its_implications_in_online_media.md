YouTube has long been a platform for various content, including animated story channels that often face criticism for their perceived low quality or sensationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These channels have become something of a laughing stock on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This has led to disputes and, in some cases, content creators like "True Stories" producing parody content that raises questions about its intent and reception.

## The Animated Story Channel Landscape

The genre of animated story channels has seen major players disappear, and views are reportedly dropping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Previously, "My Story Animated," once a dominant channel, vanished without a trace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Later, "My Story Animated" (now a de facto leader in sensationalist animated stories) entered a conflict with YouTuber Jay, who had made a reaction video to their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

"My Story Animated" reportedly demanded Jay remove his video and threatened his channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, claiming that Jay "never asked us for permission to react to our videos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. They asserted their right to deny anyone from using their videos, claiming "the same rights to our work as any big studio or franchise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, comparing themselves to major franchises like *Game of Thrones*, *Death Note*, and *Avatar: The Last Airbender* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Critics noted their messages felt childish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> and revealed a lack of understanding regarding [[fair_use_and_copyright_in_online_content | fair use]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This stance also contradicted their previous statements allowing any YouTuber to make reaction videos freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## "True Stories" and "Gross Ass Content"

Amidst this environment, an emerging channel called "True Stories" gained attention for what has been described as "gross ass content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This channel claims to create animated stories for mature audiences intended to promote critical thinking and moral reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

One notable video from "True Stories" was "My Mother Loves My Cream," which depicted a mother using her son's seminal fluid as a face cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. YouTuber Jarvis, who had bleeped out "cream" in a previous video about it, inadvertently boosted its views, leading "True Stories" to potentially target him for further attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## The "I'm a Breastfed Adult" Parody

"True Stories" subsequently created a video titled "I'm a breastfed adult," featuring a character named "Jarvis" with a similar haircut to the YouTuber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This animated story depicts "Jarvis" as an adult who continues to consume breast milk from his mother, brother's mother, sister, and eventually his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The video includes explicit details such as "Jarvis" describing different "flavor profiles" of breast milk, comparing them to banana and chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, and depicting instances of public breastfeeding in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The story also features "Jarvis" mansplaining the benefits of breast milk to his girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, suggesting that cultural marketing has sexualized breasts, making adult breastfeeding seem abnormal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

## Implications and Creator's Response

Jarvis notes that while some consider "I'm a breastfed adult" to be a [[role_of_parody_in_food_content_creation | parody]], and others mistakenly think he created the channel, neither is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. He argues that even if it were intended as [[role_of_parody_in_food_content_creation | parody]], it fails because "no one knows it's parody" due to the absence of commentary or critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The video features the same "sensational gross shit" as other animated story channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, often including disturbing themes like incest, teen pregnancy, or teacher exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

Jarvis advises viewers not to support "True Stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. In response to the video, he decided to create his own content about it, acknowledging that this provides "True Stories" with the attention they sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. He also announced a limited run of "Try My Breast" shirts, with all proceeds donated to breast cancer research, aiming to generate good from the "nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. He emphasizes that "True Stories'" video is not a factual resource on breastfeeding, which is primarily for babies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

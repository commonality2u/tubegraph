From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Gold digger pranks are a category of YouTube content where creators attempt to "expose" individuals, typically women, for being perceived as shallow or disloyal due to their interest in money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This genre is widely considered "trashy content" on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Despite their problematic nature, these [[life_hacks_and_pranks_in_youtube_videos | pranks]] have been a long-standing fixture on YouTube, leading to a degree of audience acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Characteristics of Gold Digger Pranks
The core premise involves a male creator (often described as a "fat boy" in the comedic definition) attempting to reveal a woman's perceived materialism or disloyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These videos frequently garner tens of millions of views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. The underlying message conveyed by these videos is that women are shallow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a> and need to be "exposed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Analysis of Whoo Man TV
Whoo Man TV is a prominent creator in this genre with approximately 5 million subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. His channel's description claims to offer "hilarious public [[life_hacks_and_pranks_in_youtube_videos | prank]] videos, social experiments that'll change the way you think," and content that "spreads positivity around the world and wakes others up about issues with our society about the homeless racism and more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. However, the actual content often contradicts this self-description.

### Typical Scenario
Whoo Man TV's pranks typically involve him approaching women who are already in relationships, often escalating from women alone to those with boyfriends, and eventually to married couples with children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

1.  **Initial Deception**: The prankster feigns helplessness, such as claiming to have just moved, having no food, and a dead phone, despite being near amenities like McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He might make inappropriate comments, like criticizing a woman's appearance in relation to eating McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
2.  **The Boyfriend/Husband Role**: The male partner in these scenarios often acts as a "sexist and controlling caricature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, such as prohibiting his girlfriend from having male friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
3.  **Staged Elements**: These videos are highly staged. Evidence includes:
    *   Characters remaining in place despite implied danger (e.g., oncoming traffic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Use of lavalier microphones for crisp audio, even when characters are far apart, indicating actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   The woman's attire is often chosen to be revealing and objectifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
4.  **The "Money Drop"**: A common element is the prankster comically dropping a large sum of cash from a briefcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. He might also display a luxury car, like a Ferrari, which is implied to be the sole reason for the woman's interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The prankster often claims he only gives his name to single people, despite actively trying to break up relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
5.  **"Exposing" the Woman**: The woman, played by an actress, quickly expresses willingness to leave her long-term partner, even the father of her child, for the stranger with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
6.  **Moralizing Conclusion**: Whoo Man TV frequently ends the video by confronting the "gold digger" and lecturing her on her perceived wrongdoings, positioning himself as the "moral victor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
7.  **The "Switcheroo"**: In some videos, the prank takes a twist where the boyfriend also shows interest in the money, revealing his own shallow motives and being "exposed" by the prankster as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Criticisms of Whoo Man TV
Whoo Man TV's content is criticized for:
*   **Fakeness**: The videos are highly staged and fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Perpetuating Stereotypes**: They reinforce the harmful stereotype that women are shallow and only care about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Objectification**: Women in his videos are often dressed in revealing clothing, chosen by the creator for objectification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Wish Fulfillment**: The content caters to "childish wish fulfillment" for young male viewers who may not understand relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Exploitation**: Given that the creator is an adult and has even taught a masterclass on growing a YouTube audience, his creation of content that "confirms this preconceived notion that women are shallow" is seen as exploitative at best and ignorant at worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## Other Gold Digger Prank Creators
Whoo Man TV is not alone in this genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Josh Taylor Lynn
Josh Taylor Lynn employs a "bait and switch" style, where he initially appears to be a regular guy, gets turned down by a woman (implying she rejected him due to his lack of money), and then a visibly richer man asks her out. Finally, Taylor Lynn reveals himself to be the wealthy one, causing embarrassment for the woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### UT
UT creates what he claims are "real" gold digger pranks, some lasting up to 60 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. His approach involves manipulating individuals through a series of "tests." For instance, he might offer a "broke college student" $500 for student loans to gain their trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. While the women he tests often remain loyal to their partners, men in his videos are depicted as readily abandoning their girlfriends if an attractive woman appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. If these pranks are genuine, they are seen as highly unethical, as they can cause significant emotional distress to the victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## Audience and Impact
These videos are often consumed by children and young viewers who may not understand how real relationships work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The content promotes outdated and harmful stereotypes, suggesting that women are inherently shallow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The creators behind these videos also work with "internet sleaziest sponsors," often promoting deceptive offers like "free" jewelry where customers only pay exorbitant shipping fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The creators earn significant income from ads, raising questions about which brands would associate with such problematic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

Ultimately, this genre of content is criticized for its [[criticism_of_sensationalist_content_on_youtube | sensationalist]] nature, its [[the_ethics_of_staging_prank_videos | ethical]] implications, and its reinforcement of negative gender stereotypes.

YouTube bears significant responsibility for the problematic content that has existed and flourished on its platform, including the work of creators like Shane Dawson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. The platform has historically supported and promoted certain creators, even when their content was objectionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, and has been slow or unwilling to take action against harmful behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## YouTube's Complicity and Delayed Action

YouTube has been criticized for its outright support of creators like Shane Dawson from the very beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. In the early days, Dawson's videos frequently appeared on the front page, likely placed manually before the algorithm became dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Despite hate speech being against YouTube's community guidelines since day one, these rules were never truly enforced with Shane Dawson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

Only recently, after many years, did YouTube take action by suspending ads on Shane's channels for content that was many years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. This delayed response raises questions about YouTube's awareness, as they knew this content was on their platform all along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. The argument is made that deplatforming Shane now would be hypocritical, given YouTube's complicity in creating and promoting his platform in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Throwing him "under the bus" now would primarily serve to spare YouTube's public relations rather than solve the underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Systemic Issues and Algorithmic Incentives

Shane Dawson's old content is seen as a symptom of a larger systemic problem within YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. YouTube needs to acknowledge who it gives a platform to and how it promotes creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Examples like Jstation and other bizarre animated stories are cited as harmful content that still exists and, in some cases, isn't technically breaking rules, despite appearing to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

YouTube's response to such situations has often been slow, typically reacting only when there's a petition or someone gets arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. The platform should also be mindful of its algorithm and the incentives it creates, which can inadvertently drive people to produce harmful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. If YouTube does not intervene to stop this "vicious cycle of content," the community risks seeing increasingly problematic material at the bottom of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Acknowledging Past Support and Moving Forward

Community and industry leaders also played a role in propping up Shane Dawson in the past, despite his objectionable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. An example includes a "harrowing" 2012 VidCon performance and a 2010 USA Today profile that celebrated his success while racist content was visible in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

To move forward, the YouTube community should be more proactive in addressing issues in the moment, rather than trying to rectify things years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This involves repairing the foundation of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

The speaker, as a creator, feels a responsibility to their audience to express their stance on these issues, believing it can help advance the dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. They emphasize that harassing people online is unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. If a creator is attacked, their audience should not resort to bad faith actions or threats of violence, which were happening on Shane's behalf because he failed to "reign those people in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This highlights the significant power creators and platforms wield, and with that power comes great responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

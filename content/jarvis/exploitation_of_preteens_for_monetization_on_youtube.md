Recent concerns have highlighted videos clearly intended for children that likely should not exist on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While discussions often focus on [[youtube_content_targeting_children | YouTube content targeting children]] for the youngest ages, such as content on the YouTube Kids app or educational animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, there's less attention on content for preteens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Preteen Presence on YouTube
Despite a technical [[age_restrictions_on_youtube | rule]] requiring users to be at least 13 to be on regular YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, it's evident that kids often bypass this by lying about their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. For example, a Bright Side video titled "This Map Trick Will Guess Your Age" features comments from children under 13 discussing how the video incorrectly guessed their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This demonstrates a significant presence of preteens on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Targeting Preteens for Monetization
With a large [[youtube_channel_demographics | demographic]] of preteens on YouTube, many creators actively try to maximize ad revenue from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This often involves [[youtube_exploitation_tactics | exploitative tactics]] and the creation of content designed to be sensationalist or shocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Sub-genres of Exploitative Content
A notable sub-genre aims to intentionally "creep kids out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

*   **3 AM Challenge**: Searching "3 a.m. Challenge" on YouTube reveals numerous videos featuring haunted characters or calling them on FaceTime at 3 a.m., such as "Barney is haunted" or "calling Barney on FaceTime at 3 a.m." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These videos specifically target this young demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
    *   **J station**: A prominent creator, J station, builds his entire brand around "creeping out kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. His channel features a variety of "upsetting content" involving characters like Freddy Krueger, Mike Myers, and Cookie Monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Some of his videos are highly disrespectful, such as one claiming to talk to the spirit of Mac Miller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Other YouTubers like Deanna Gonzales and Cody Cove have also made videos discussing J station and the 3 a.m. challenge trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

*   **"Ordering Magic Potions from the Dark Web"**: A newer trend involves creators pretending to order "magic potions" from the dark web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The "dark web" is used as a placeholder for a "creepy Internet place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, and these fake potions are claimed to grant "creepy or magical powers" like shape-shifting, teleporting, or turning into a baby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Case Study: The "Gay Potion" Trilogy
A particularly problematic example within the "dark web potion" trend is the "gay potion" series, which is described as "mega homophobic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> because its premise hinges on the idea that "being gay is like spooky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### "We Kissed Ordering Gay Potion from the Dark Web at 3 AM"
In one such video by J station, he and his friend, J Hills, claim to have discovered a "gay potion" from the dark web that turns anyone gay for one hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Premise**: Despite the ability to pretend the potion gives any power, they chose "turning gay for one hour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Homophobia**: The video constantly emphasizes the creators are "straight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, and the entire premise relies on systemic homophobia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Stereotypes and Non-Consensual Touching**: After J Hills "drinks" the potion, he performs a "grossly stereotypical gay impression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a> and engages in non-consensual touching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, later putting on lipstick in an inexplicable sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. They then resort to stereotypes about women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The video culminates with J Hills chasing J station, trying to force himself on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, until the potion "wears off" and he has complete amnesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Target Audience**: The comments on these videos suggest the audience includes children who are disgusted, offended, or genuinely believe the content to be real and scary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

### Subsequent "Gay Potion" Videos
*   **Kermit the Frog Series**: Another video in the series features Kermit the Frog holding J station's channel hostage, forcing him to drink the gay potion to get it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The video ends with J station agreeing to sensually kiss the Kermit puppet for 30 seconds to reclaim his channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. The final video of the trilogy, "We Made Out Making Kermit the Frog Drink the Gay Potion," uses a remix of Alex Jones's "turned the frogs gay" quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **"I Mixed the Baby and Gay Potion from the Dark Web"**: J Hills, J station's friend, also posted a video titled "I Mixed the Baby and Gay Potion from the Dark Web and Used it on I'm J station Insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, illustrating the [[proliferation_of_fake_animated_story_channels_on_youtube | proliferation of fake animated story channels on YouTube]] and similar content.

## Broader Implications and Criticism
These videos, while presented as entertaining, are created "at the expense of a marginalized group" and are perceived as a "clear money grab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. This type of content, which mixes "clout chasing with ignorance," can result in real harm to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. This exemplifies [[criticism_of_sensationalist_content_on_youtube | criticism of sensationalist content on YouTube]] and raises [[ethical_concerns_about_content_appropriation_on_youtube | ethical concerns about content appropriation on YouTube]], specifically regarding [[the_issue_of_inappropriate_childrens_content_on_youtube | inappropriate children's content on YouTube]].

### Positive Counter-Examples
In contrast to such exploitative content, there is media that offers positive depictions of LGBTQ+ individuals, portraying them as regular people without sensationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Examples include the fiction podcast "The Bright Sessions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a> and YouTubers like Jackson Byrd, It's Radish Time, Asante B, and Rowan Ellis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. Such content aims to make children and adults feel less alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

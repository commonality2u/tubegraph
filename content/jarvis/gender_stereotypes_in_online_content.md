From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Online content, particularly on platforms like YouTube, features genres that perpetuate and reinforce harmful gender stereotypes. One notable example is the "gold digger prank" genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Gold Digger Pranks

These videos typically involve a male content creator, often described as a "fat boy," attempting to "expose" a woman for being a "gold digger," shallow, solely focused on money, or disloyal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This type of content is considered among the "trashiest" on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Stereotypical Portrayal of Women

The genre often operates under the implied premise that "all women are evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, though this is sometimes presented with verbal irony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Common tropes include:
*   **Objectification**: Women are frequently depicted wearing "bathing suits or otherwise very revealing clothing" chosen by the creator, enabling their objectification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Shallowness**: The core premise is that women are easily swayed by wealth, assuming that a woman's interest in a man is solely driven by his money or possessions, like a fancy car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This suggests a "childish wish fulfillment" that women are "fickle" and can be "whisked away" from their responsibilities by a rich stranger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Deficiency**: Some videos imply that women are ignorant about common luxury car brands like Ferrari, leading to condescending questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Slut-shaming**: The content is designed to create a situation where women are "slut-shamed" for supposedly succumbing to financial temptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Stereotypical Portrayal of Men

While primarily targeting women, these pranks also feature [[Commentary on stereotypical masculinity]]:
*   **Controlling Boyfriends**: Male partners in these scenarios are often depicted as "sexist and controlling caricatures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Wish Fulfillment**: The male prankster's actions reflect a "wish fulfillment" to be so "desirable that women destroy their lives to be with" him, suggesting a deep-seated insecurity related to past acceptance by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Hypocrisy**: In some pranks, the male "victim" of the "gold digger" is himself quickly tempted to leave his partner for financial gain, highlighting a double standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Prominent Creators and Content Characteristics

One prominent creator in this genre is Woo Man TV, with over 5 million subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Despite his channel description claiming to "spread positivity" and "wake others up about issues with our society" like homelessness and racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, his content typically involves staged scenarios where a man tries to entice women away from their partners with displays of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Fictional or Real Scenarios

These videos are often staged and "very very fake," using lavalier microphones to capture crisp audio from all participants, even when they are far apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The scenarios involve contrived situations, such as large sums of cash "comically" falling out of briefcases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, or unrealistic claims about dead phones and lack of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Other creators, like Josh Taylor Lynn, employ a "bait and switch" method where a woman initially rejects a man, only to show interest when a "visibly richer man" appears, who is then revealed to be the same person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Some creators claim their pranks are "real," like UTD, who manipulates individuals through "tests" to expose them as gold diggers, even involving giving money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This type of content is criticized for being "gross" and potentially causing lasting trust issues for victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

## Audience and Impact

Despite their often-staged nature, these videos gain "tens of millions of views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. They are particularly watched by "kids who watch it have no idea" they are fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, including "thirteen-year-olds" who "don't know how relationships work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

The content's primary takeaway is often that "women are shallow," and it serves to "confirm this preconceived notion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This type of [[representation_and_stereotypes_in_video_content]] contributes to [[cultural_stereotypes_in_media]].

The creators, often adults, profit from this "exploitative at best" content, suggesting they are aware of the "horrible message" they are conveying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Their business models include ads and sponsorships with "sleaziest sponsors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, as well as merchandise sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_online_fame_and_popularity_on_content_creation]].

While the content heavily focuses on "gold digger" women, it rarely scrutinizes the male figures in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This perpetuates a biased and unbalanced [[portrayal_of_relationships_on_social_media]].

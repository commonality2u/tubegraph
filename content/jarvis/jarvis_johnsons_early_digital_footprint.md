[[jarvis_johnson_as_a_youtube_figure | Jarvis Johnson]] explores his extensive early digital footprint, showcasing various past online endeavors that highlight his evolution as a creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. He describes himself as his "own worst critic" with abundant "ammo" on his past self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Growing up on the internet, he accumulated a "pretty big digital footprint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Early YouTube Adventures (2006-2009)

[[jarvis_johnson_as_a_youtube_figure | Johnson]] began his YouTube channel in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. It can still be accessed via `youtube.com/user/vsympathyv` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, a username derived from one of his Runescape accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. He created the channel at 14 years old to post Runescape videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Runescape & Abandonment

His first Runescape video, though deleted from his channel, was locally saved. He describes it as "the least compelling thing ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Following this, he immediately abandoned making Runescape videos, noting that "abandoning things was kind of my brand back then" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### High School Musical 2 Dance Video

The very next content he created was a dance video for "High School Musical 2," which he considers a "goddamn masterpiece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The 2007 video notably featured an orange tint and showcased him and a friend wearing Rubik's Cube shirts, a trend he attributed to "cool people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. He grew "defensive" in the comments about audio/video offset issues, blaming YouTube rather than his own editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Japanese Meme Video

After a two-year hiatus from uploading, [[jarvis_johnson_as_a_youtube_figure | Johnson]] posted a video related to a Japanese meme called "Get Down or Get On" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. He cringes at his appearance in the video, where he wore a brown hoodie with a skull, resembling an "emo piece of pumpkin pie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Podcasting Endeavor: "The Random Podcast" (2007)

In 2007, at 14, [[jarvis_johnson_as_a_youtube_figure | Johnson]] also launched a podcast called "The Random Podcast," admitting he had "no imagination" for names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The podcast was essentially a "recorded Skype conversation between three 14-year-olds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

The first episode included a segment titled "You Know What Really Grinds My Gears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. In this segment, he expressed strong disdain for "Healys" (rollerblade shoes) and used inappropriate humor about feeding them to "hungry African children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. [[jarvis_johnson_as_a_youtube_figure | Johnson]] later expressed disappointment in himself for this "inappropriate 14 year old humor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

The podcast was short-lived, like many of his early projects, consisting of only five episodes posted to Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## High School Rapping Days

[[jarvis_johnson_as_a_youtube_figure | Johnson]] also uploaded videos of himself rapping on Facebook during high school, often freestyling with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. He describes some of this content as "so cringy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

One rap example shows him in his kitchen holding a Guitar Hero mic, which he facetiously claims "the hardest rappers use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. His opening lines included director's commentary, which he compares to something [[kanye_west | Kanye West]] would do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. His lyrics were often filled with "nerdy punch lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## Brief Foray into Vine

After college, [[jarvis_johnson_as_a_youtube_figure | Johnson]] created only three Vines, which he humorously notes would only make an 18-second compilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **"Banana Nut"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>: A comedic interaction with friends.
*   **"That's My Cue"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>: Based on a misheard drum hit in Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **"That's My Jam"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>: A pun-based Vine about muffins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## Modern YouTube Era

His first "real video" as an adult was released a year prior to this reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. He notes how different it still feels from his current content, attributing his "Jarvis is trying his best" catchphrase to an iMovie transition he couldn't replicate in Premiere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

[[jarvis_johnson_as_a_youtube_figure | Johnson]] also reflected on his past self-criticism and fear of not living up to expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. He confesses he was a "shitty kid" who "had to be good at everything they try on the first try" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. He cites an old video where he made fun of a classmate's speech as an example of "punching down" in comedy, contrasting it with his current practice of criticizing large entities like Five-Minute Crafts, which he views as "punching up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

## Reflection on Growth and Identity

[[jarvis_johnson_as_a_youtube_figure | Johnson]] emphasizes that he is "not the same person" he was 11 or 12 years ago, highlighting that "people can grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

Despite his channel's recent growth to 300,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, he admits to feeling vulnerable, struggling with imposter syndrome, and worrying about disappointing his audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He views YouTube as a platform for him to "experiment and grow with my creativity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. He concludes that "it can be scary to try something earnestly because of the fear of not being accepted, but it's necessary for growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. His approach to [[creator_identity_and_creative_direction_on_youtube | creative direction]] is to simply continue creating, regardless of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

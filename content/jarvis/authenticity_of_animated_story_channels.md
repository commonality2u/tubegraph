## Overview of "Actually Happened"

"Actually Happened" was a YouTube channel that claimed to tell the "truest animated stories" from the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The channel asserted that it animated stories shared by children and had a professional voice actor narrate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Questions of Authenticity and Plagiarism

Despite the channel's name, the authenticity of its stories has been widely questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Evidence suggests that many of the narratives featured were not original:
*   **Borrowed Content** Many stories were found to be located in Reddit threads that were years old, appearing almost verbatim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Examples include stories about pretending not to know what potatoes were, or breaking up with a girlfriend due to potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Fabricated Narratives** Over time, the channel's content shifted from [[plagiarism_in_animated_stories | plagiarized]] Reddit stories to "provably untrue stories" that were created with just enough detail to appear fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. One example given was a story about a school confiscating water bottles for unknown reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Celebrity Impersonations** The channel also began featuring stories from the first-person perspective of real-life celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Billie Eilish, and Jackie Chan, as if the celebrities themselves were narrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Relation to Other Channels

"Actually Happened" started as a copy of "Storybooth," a legitimate channel that genuinely collaborates with children and their families to animate and voice their own stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The success of "Actually Happened" inspired a [[proliferation_of_fake_animated_story_channels_on_youtube | proliferation of copycat channels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### The Rise of Fake Animated Story Channels

A significant number of YouTube channels have emerged by combining terms like "story," "animated," "happened," and "my" in various permutations to create similar [[overview_of_animated_story_channels | animated story channels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. These include "Actually Happened Animate My Story," "My Story Animated," and "My Crazy Story," among many others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

Many of these channels, including "Actually Happened," are accused of using "extreme and sensationalist fake stories" primarily to manipulate children's emotions for views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### "My Story Animated" as an Example

"My Story Animated," founded by an Israeli app developer, has a subscriber count nearly equal to "Actually Happened" and features "far more objectionable content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Examples of its video titles include:
*   "I eat scorpions for breakfast to become poisonous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
*   "I am a bodybuilder and my boyfriend is a tiny little guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
*   "Me and my BFF fell for it" (accompanied by a thumbnail showing two pregnant women and a man with an Infinity Gauntlet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>

## Issues with the System

The presence of numerous [[critique_of_animated_story_channels | fake animated story channels]] highlights a systemic problem on platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The proliferation of such content, designed to exploit emotional responses for views, is considered problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Addressing this issue would require a systemic approach rather than merely dealing with individual channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

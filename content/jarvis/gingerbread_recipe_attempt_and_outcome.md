This article details an attempt to follow a gingerbread recipe from the [[following_a_troom_troom_cooking_tutorial | Troom Troom]] YouTube channel, known for its peculiar DIY content and [[challenges_with_cooking_and_baking | questionable life hacks]]. The goal was to test the feasibility and outcome of one of their culinary creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Background on Troom Troom
[[following_a_troom_troom_cooking_tutorial | Troom Troom]] is characterized by its clickbait thumbnails, nameless characters like Blondie and Blue-Eyed Girl, and the mystery surrounding who operates the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The channel is known for its "unicorn hack videos," which appear to be a made-up genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. According to a Box Profile article, [[following_a_troom_troom_cooking_tutorial | Troom Troom]] is not run like a traditional company, but rather is the "result of the collective mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Selecting the Recipe
The video chosen for this experiment was titled "DIY Giant vs. Miniature Christmas Candy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The thumbnail depicted a gigantic gingerbread man from *Shrek* lounging on a couch with a character known as Redhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Despite the obvious clickbait nature of the thumbnail, which the narrator recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, the decision was made to attempt the gingerbread recipe shown in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

The [[following_a_troom_troom_cooking_tutorial | Troom Troom]] video starts with a character, Redhead, finding and eating a single cookie, leading to Emma finding an entire "gingerbread colony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The recipe then begins by instructing to mash five ounces of butter with the same amount of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Ingredient Sourcing and Preparation
The butter was readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. For sugar, brown sugar was used instead of white sugar, raising concerns about ruining the recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The measuring process for sugar proved difficult, involving the use of "Russian nesting dolls" (measuring cups) and struggles to get the brown sugar out of the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

After combining butter and sugar, the recipe called for melting the mixture in a microwave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This required switching to a microwave-safe bowl as the initial one was metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The mixture was melted until it was "pretty melty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Next, five ounces of honey were added, which was difficult to extract from the bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The honey was eventually warmed in the microwave to loosen it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Two medium grade double-A eggs were then added and mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. One teaspoon of cinnamon and one teaspoon of ground ginger were subsequently incorporated, giving the mixture a festive smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Dough Preparation
The recipe instructed to gradually add 25 ounces of all-purpose flour and knead the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. As the dough thickened, hand kneading became necessary due to wrist pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The dough's consistency was noted to be similar to Play-Doh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Without construction paper for stenciling or a rolling pin, the dough was free-handed into a gingerbread man shape and flattened using a water bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The resulting shape was "not perfect but for free hinge it's not bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Baking and Initial Outcome
The gingerbread man was placed in the oven, preheated to 300 degrees Fahrenheit, for 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. A mistake was almost made by attempting to put wax paper in the oven, which is not safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

Upon removal from the oven, the gingerbread man's color was confusingly lighter than the raw dough, leading to uncertainty if it was cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. It also had a "boil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Flipping it over was attempted to aid baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Despite following the recipe, the gingerbread tasted "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a> and eventually tasted burnt and like cardboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, feeling very soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### Glaze Preparation
While the gingerbread baked, a glaze was prepared by mixing 10 ounces of powdered sugar, the juice of half a lemon, and a little water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The glaze turned out very runny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Analysis of Failures
The primary issue identified was the absence of key ingredients, specifically molasses, which is common in gingerbread recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. The recipe yielded a "very structurally sound gingerbread" but with "little thought to its taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. It was speculated that [[following_a_troom_troom_cooking_tutorial | Troom Troom]] likely doesn't expect anyone to actually try the things made in their videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Attempting a "Giant" Gingerbread Man
To achieve the "giant" size implied by the [[following_a_troom_troom_cooking_tutorial | Troom Troom]] thumbnail, a larger gingerbread man was constructed in parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

*   **Head**: The head was made from the leftover dough of the first batch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a> and ended up very dark due to being in the oven for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   **Limbs and New Batch**: For the other limbs, a whole new batch of gingerbread dough was made, with some ingredient changes in an attempt to improve the taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. This second batch was stickier, and chilling the dough was attempted, though it didn't help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Assembly**: The challenge of assembling the parts into one piece was met by using melted gummy bears as "cement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. The gummy bear "cement" was applied to attach the arms and head, with pressure applied to bind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## Final Outcome and Taste Test
The final [[gettys_unique_recipes | gingerbread man]] was described as a "badly burned beach dolphin" and caused a new roommate to scream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. While it stood up on the couch for the recreation of the thumbnail, the heat from the lights caused the icing to melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

The taste test of the giant gingerbread man revealed it was "better but not by much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. Andy, the person behind the camera, described it as "hard wood" that "tastes like cardboard with a hint of cinnamon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. The denseness of the dough was attributed to not kneading it long enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Conclusion
The [[following_a_troom_troom_cooking_tutorial | Troom Troom]] recipe was ultimately deemed "very bad," or the narrator admitted to being a "very bad cook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Despite the poor edible outcome, the experience of following the tutorial was considered fun and entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

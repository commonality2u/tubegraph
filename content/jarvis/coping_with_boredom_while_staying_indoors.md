Confined to home during "the end times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, many individuals experience loneliness and boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. One approach to [[staying_productive_during_quarantine | coping with boredom]] is to actively seek out new activities and hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Finding Activities and Hobbies

A useful resource for combating boredom can be an article or list detailing "100 things to do while stuck inside due to a pandemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This can serve as a guide for [[exploring_new_hobbies_at_home | exploring new hobbies]] quickly, perhaps by dedicating only a few minutes to each activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Key strategies include:

*   **Making do with what you have** Due to restrictions on leaving the house, it may be necessary to improvise and [[repurposing_everyday_items_for_unintended_uses | make do]] with available items instead of purchasing new supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Outcomes and Reflections

While some activities provided a sense of accomplishment, like starting a blog, learning piano, and Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, a distinct "new hobby" was not found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Many suggested activities felt like chores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Ultimately, it's acknowledged that there's no pressure to become "the best versions of ourselves" during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The focus should be on doing whatever is necessary to navigate the period, including simply chilling out and enjoying oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, and spending time digitally with loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

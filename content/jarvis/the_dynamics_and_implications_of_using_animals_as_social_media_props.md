Social media influencer "Two Turnt Tony" (also known as Tony Twittle) has gained significant attention on TikTok, amassing over nine million followers, largely through content featuring his pet ducks and chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:18">[08:28:18]</a>. His approach to content creation, which blurs the lines between pet ownership and using animals as props for entertainment, raises questions about [[the_use_of_extreme_content_for_social_media_engagement | the use of extreme content for social media engagement]], the [[portrayal_of_relationships_on_social_media | portrayal of relationships on social media]], and the [[ethics_of_blending_fiction_and_reality_on_social_media | ethics of blending fiction and reality on social media]].

## "Pets" or "Props"? The Core Controversy

A central point of contention surrounding Two Turnt Tony's content is his use of animals. While he adamantly states his animals are "pets," not "props," his interactions with them in videos often lead viewers to question this distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:05">[03:05:05]</a>. When an audience member merely tweeted that he uses a duck as a prop, Tony replied aggressively, stating, "They're my pets you worthless pos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This aggressive stance, described as "needlessly so," is indicative of [[social_media_outrage_culture_and_its_monetization | social media outrage culture and its monetization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

### Controversial Content Featuring Animals

Tony's videos frequently depict interactions with his animals that are considered "too turnt" (excessively wild or inappropriate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>:

*   **"Eggplant Pills" Incident** In one TikTok, Tony consumes or interacts with what he calls "eggplant emoji pills," comically pouring them over his face from an oversized bottle, with many pills scattering on the floor near his duck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. This raises concerns about the duck potentially ingesting the pills, as "eggplant is really bad for ducks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.
*   **Sensual Portrayal of Animals** Tony is shown holding a chicken in a "very sensual" manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. Later, a duck appears in "lingerie" or a "lacy top," implying a sexualized narrative, especially following the "eggplant pills" video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. This deliberate sexualization of animals for content is viewed as "not exactly normal behavior" and squarely positions the animals as props <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.
*   **Implied Animal Relationships and "Daddy Kink"** Some videos suggest complex, human-like relationships between Tony and his animals, including jealousy between the duck and chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. One particularly unsettling instance features a duck apparently saying, "Yes, daddy," after Tony speaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>. This implies a "daddy kink" dynamic that exploits a "weird power dynamic" between owner and pet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>.
*   **Endangering Animals for Pranks** In one video, Tony pranks his hungover sister by placing a chicken in a boat and pushing her out to sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. The chicken is left on the boat, raising concerns about endangering the animal, as chickens "can't necessarily fly" back to shore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a>.

## Blurring Reality and Fiction

[[Ethics_of_blending_fiction_and_reality_on_social_media | Blending fiction and reality]] is a common strategy in social media content, and Tony's videos frequently employ this. His content features a "reality show vibe" where his parents and sister are involved in pranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. However, the authenticity of these interactions is questioned, as his mother, despite appearing "extremely pissed off," allows the cameraman to get "so close to her face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>. Similarly, a female "model" wearing a ski mask is used as a "literal table" for a chicken in a prank that didn't require a second person, suggesting her role was purely for visual engagement, highlighting [[the_use_of_extreme_content_for_social_media_engagement | the use of extreme content for social media engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:00">[25:30:00]</a>.

## The "Turnt" Scale and Influencer Behavior

The concept of "turntidness" serves as a measure of appropriate or inappropriate behavior on social media. Many of Tony's actions, such as his aggressive replies to critical comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, his claim to "live for a living" (implying he doesn't work) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, and especially his interactions with his animals, fall on the "too turnt" side of the scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:05]</a>.

While some content, like a "happy duck family" video, might be considered "not two-turned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:00">[22:18:00]</a>, the majority of Tony's popular videos lean into provocative and often questionable interactions. This [[analysis_of_social_media_influencer_behavior | analysis of social media influencer behavior]] suggests that while his methods achieve significant engagement, they raise serious ethical considerations regarding animal welfare and the boundaries of online content.

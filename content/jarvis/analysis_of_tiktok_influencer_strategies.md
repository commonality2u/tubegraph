One particular subject of [[commentary_on_tiktok_trends | commentary on TikTok trends]] is Adam Roberts, known as "Ads Roberts," whose content is identified as "basic problematic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. His approach to [[content_creation_strategies_on_tiktok | content creation on TikTok]] is characterized by extreme repetition and low effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

## Content Creation and Presentation
Adam Roberts's content strategy revolves around a highly consistent, almost unchanging, visual presentation and predictable content patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Visual Consistency
Roberts maintains a very specific aesthetic across all his videos:
- **Expressionless Face** He consistently displays an "expressionless face," which is described as an "idle animation in a video game" or resembling a "Sims creative character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. This allows viewers to "project any emotion onto [his] blank face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.
- **Identical Setting** Every video is filmed in front of the same picture frame, perfectly offset, using the same initial "finger thing" gesture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
- **Repetitive Thumbnails** The consistency is so high that some thumbnails are almost identical, leading to an initial assumption that it might be the same video feed with different text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Low-Effort Content Generation
Roberts's strategy allows for rapid content production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>:
- He can film hours of content in one session without changing his expression or setting, potentially cranking out "30 of these [videos] a day easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
- His content is considered "potentially the lowest possible effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>, contrasting with other POV content creators who use different sets, outfits, and editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

### Content Themes and Approach
Roberts's videos typically follow a "setup in a punchline" structure, luring the viewer with a question before delivering a straightforward or obvious answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

Common themes include:
- **Basic Relationship Observations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>
    - If you text someone every day, "you have a relationship with that person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
    - How to know if someone "truly loves you": they "tell you that he truly loves you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
    - Signs you've met "the one": you can be "the most vulnerable version of yourself around them," you are "each other's biggest supporters," they "feel like home," and you "have that gut feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>.
    - Signs a relationship is "past the breaking point": "every discussion turns an argument," "even the small things they do start to bother you," and you "don't feel wanted anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>.
- **"Toxic" Relationship Advice** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>
    - "Open their messages but don't reply straight away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This is dismissed as "13-year-old" behavior rather than genuinely toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
    - "Tell them they are different to anyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. This is interpreted as the "you're not like other girls" trope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.
    - "Get kidnapped" (due to a spelling error for "disappear") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. This advice is surprisingly extreme compared to the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

### Plagiarism and Repurposing
It is speculated that Roberts does not write his own content, but rather pulls "deep quotes" or variations of common sayings from sources like Pinterest or viral tweets, indicating a form of content plagiarism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. He even re-uses entire audio clips from other videos, sometimes without the context of the original conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>.

## Audience Engagement and Interpretation
Roberts's content strategy seems to rely on the audience's interpretation and projection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. By showing no expression, he allows viewers to interpret his emotions related to the on-screen text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.

His videos often present obvious statements as profound insights, playing on the idea that "people with accents sound smarter than they are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>. For example, he states that "people are the most complex things in the world" and "a person involved who doesn't think logically [\h__\h] it all out the window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>.

Roberts's [[content_creation_strategies_on_tiktok | content creation strategies on TikTok]] highlight a trend of low-effort, repetitive content that leverages visual consistency and ambiguous messaging to gain traction, sometimes by borrowing or repurposing existing popular sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>.

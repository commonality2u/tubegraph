The world of relationships is vast and varied, encompassing everything from profound bonds to the utterly bizarre. This article explores several peculiar and sometimes humorous relationship anecdotes, primarily sourced from online communities like Reddit and Twitter, as shared by the speaker.

## Defining "Relationships"
The speaker humorously defines relationships broadly, even citing a personal "relationship" with a candle named Kevin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Kevin, the candle, is noted for his name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Relationships in the Digital Sphere
Social media platforms like Twitter frequently feature viral discussions about relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. These can range from wholesome connections, like that between a deaf cat and a vacuum cleaner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, to adversarial ones, such as a dispute involving "Kidz Bop Karen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The focus here is on [[weird_relationships_on_reddit | weird relationships]], including observations on the family dynamics of Kanye West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Reddit's r/relationships
The subreddit r/relationships is a significant source of unusual stories that often go viral on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. While the speaker initially questions if Reddit holds people accountable and teaches life lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, they later discover the subreddit is actually a supportive community for advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, the viral posts tend to follow a specific, peculiar format: everything in the relationship is perfect, except for one obvious deal-breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Examples of these [[humorous_personal_relationships | humorous personal relationships]] and [[challenging_relationship_dynamics | challenging relationship dynamics]] highlighted include:
*   A girlfriend unblocking her cheating boyfriend weekly to send him *Game of Thrones* spoilers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   A partner who wants to be called "senpai" during sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   A girlfriend who surprises her partner with unwanted Almond Joy candy bars as a first-date reminder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   A man with short arms seeking advice on how to put his arm around his girlfriend, complete with diagrams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

#### The "Yawn-Taking" Boyfriend
One specific story involves a boyfriend who insists on "taking" his girlfriend's yawns by inhaling them from her mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Initially seen as silly, this behavior escalates to the boyfriend becoming upset if she doesn't allow him to take her yawns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The speaker jokingly suggests this boyfriend might be a demon trying to steal her soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

#### The "Philosopher" Husband
Another viral story details a physicist wife whose marriage is strained by her husband, an academic philosopher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The husband demands his wife seriously engage with his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, which she finds "completely insane" and contains "embarrassingly wrong" claims about physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. He mansplains physics to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> and is obsessed with 19th-century German philosopher Hegel, keeping a framed picture of him and even using it as his phone background instead of his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Despite his claims, he misuses German phrases and terms, even though his wife is a native German speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

#### Other Brief Mentions
*   A wife calling her husband "Phil" during sex when his name is Elijah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   A husband wanting to live on a boat despite his wife's known aversion to boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   A boyfriend constantly looking at Reddit, even while kissing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

#### The "Magician Restaurant" Husband
The final and most elaborate story involves a husband who wants to quit his job and use all of the family's savings to open a restaurant specifically "for magicians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The restaurant would feature "magical props" like levitating tables, bending cutlery, and torn-and-restored menus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Meals could include a specific playing card secreted inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, and waiters would always say "7 of hearts" if asked to think of a card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The intent is for men on dates to impress their companions with "spontaneous magic tricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

The husband, who had no prior interest in magic, was convinced by a new friend named Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Chris, described as a "magic enthusiast," persuaded the husband to pursue this idea, leading to a major fight where the wife insulted the restaurant idea, his cooking, and Chris himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. The husband believes his idea is good because Chris, a "magician," is smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The wife expresses concern that her husband's judgment is clouded by his fixation on Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a> and fears for their family's financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

## Authenticity and Advice
The speaker questions the authenticity of some of these [[user_submitted_stories_and_their_authenticity | user submitted stories]], particularly the magician restaurant, as it seems "pretty hard to believe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Despite the potential for fabrication, the speaker offers genuine advice for those facing similar [[challenging_relationship_dynamics | challenging relationship dynamics]]: open communication with your partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. If that fails, they humorously suggest consulting a warlock to break any "spell" cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. They conclude by stating that even if the stories are made up, it's fun to "believe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

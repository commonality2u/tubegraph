From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Many individuals seek guidance on how to enter the software engineering field, what to study, or where to attend college. Despite the abundance of online resources, this information often appears scarce or confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A simple Google search can yield advice that is often [[common_misconceptions_about_software_engineering_education | misleading]] or unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Critiques of Common Online Advice

### wikiHow: "How to Become a Software Engineer"

WikiHow's article, despite being "reader-approved" and having many co-authors, provides questionable advice for aspiring software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

*   **Earning a Degree in Software Engineering**: The article suggests that majoring in software engineering provides the "most useful background" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, software engineering is not the most popular major for software engineers; Computer Science is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. While Computer Science is often presented as a "more theoretical approach" or a "good backup choice," most programs incorporate elements of software engineering into their curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

*   **Beginning Programming Immediately**: The advice states that one should start programming even in grade school to get a "huge head start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. While learning languages is mentioned, the article fails to emphasize the importance of applying them through projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. It is more effective to start with what you want to create and then choose the technology that helps achieve that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

*   **Studying Math**: The article suggests studying math because "software engineers sometimes create mathematical algorithms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. However, the relevance of math depends heavily on the specific domain of software engineering; it may be crucial for a physics engine in a video game but irrelevant for building a blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

*   **Building Software**: This is identified as one of the few pieces of good advice, stating that "the best way to improve your skills is to use them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

*   **Advice for Career Switchers**: For those switching careers, wikiHow's advice essentially suggests going back to college and starting over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This ignores the viability of coding bootcamps and online resources, which have enabled many people with unrelated degrees to enter software engineering without needing a traditional four-year institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

*   **Underlying Issues**: This type of advice often "reeks of [[survivorship_bias_in_career_advice | survivorship bias]] and like a superiority complex," suggesting that the only valid path is the one the author took, implying it was uniquely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Hacker Noon: "Want to become a software developer? Here's how to get there"

Hacker Noon's article begins with a "warning," presenting programming as "not for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, and frames it with several demanding requirements.

*   **Immense Dedication and Passion**: The article claims that software engineering "requires immense [[the_role_of_passion_and_dedication_in_software_engineering | dedication]]" and "passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. While passion can be helpful, many successful software engineers are not "immensely dedicated" to their craft and simply work to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The article suggests that without passion, one will be "mercilessly left behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, creating undue pressure and potentially hindering progress for those waiting for passion to appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

*   **Challenging Work Environment**: The article describes software engineering as "challenging," involving "long hours of mentally taxing work, impossible deadlines, legacy unmaintainable code, inconsistent ambiguous requirements, and suboptimal office environments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This exaggeration portrays the job as an intense struggle rather than a profession with both challenging and rewarding aspects, like any other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. These [[challenges_faced_by_software_engineers | challenges]] are not unique to software engineering and are often overcome through collaboration.

*   **Self-Taught Requirement**: It asserts that one must be "self-taught" because "when your code breaks nobody's gonna be there to hold your hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This overlooks the crucial role of teamwork, where colleagues support each other to succeed, recognizing that groups accomplish more than individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

*   **Overall Tone**: The article's tone is criticized for "fear-mongering" and being a way for the author to "pat themselves on the back," contributing to a "toxic bull" that makes the industry uninviting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Business Insider: "17 Tips on How to Keep Your Software Engineering Job Even During a Market Crash"

This article offers advice for maintaining employment during economic downturns, but some tips are counterproductive or nonsensical. This advice attempts to address [[the_impact_of_market_conditions_on_software_engineering_jobs | the impact of market conditions on software engineering jobs]].

*   **Work in a Mediocre Area/Lower the Bar**: Advice such as "work in an area where even a mediocre engineer can have stability" or "sometimes not having a high salary helps" implies lowering one's standards or self-respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

*   **Show True Dedication**: This tip reiterates the problematic emphasis on "true dedication" without practical, actionable advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

*   **Interview Well**: Stating "just don't be bad" as advice for interviewing is unhelpful and obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

*   **Work in a Recession-Proof Industry**: This is presented with a ridiculous image of working inside a tank, illustrating the impracticality of some suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

*   **Build a Personal Brand Outside Your Company**: While this can be fine advice, the accompanying image of Darth Vader as a disgraced tech reviewer (Robert Scoble) is irrelevant and bizarre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Five-Minute Crafts: "20 Tips If You Spend Your Life In Front Of A Computer"

This video, while not directly career advice, exemplifies [[misleading_mobile_game_ads | misleading]] or useless "life hacks" for computer users, inadvertently contributing to the general noise of unhelpful online content. Tips include:

*   Demonstrating how to use a mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   Performing bizarre exercises requiring a desk bolted to the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   Creating putty from school glue, coloring, and soda to press onto a keyboard, resulting in a keyboard imprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   Using electric tape on a fork to prop up a laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   Putting five dollars into a laptop's CD drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   Transforming a hoodie into a backpack to carry a laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

These examples highlight the prevalence of unhelpful or even absurd advice found online, contributing to the confusion faced by individuals seeking genuine guidance on a career in software engineering.

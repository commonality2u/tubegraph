From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

During a period of isolation, individuals may find themselves with extra time at home and a desire to explore new activities or find a new hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This often involves looking for [[coping_with_boredom_while_staying_indoors | things to do while stuck inside]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Quest for a New Hobby

One approach to [[coping_with_boredom_while_staying_indoors | combating boredom]] and maintaining [[staying_productive_during_quarantine | productivity]] during extended periods at home is to consult curated lists of activities. The narrator of one video, for instance, found an article titled "100 things to do while stuck inside due to a pandemic," which served as a guide for her personal challenge to try all 100 items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The goal was to find a new hobby as quickly as possible, adopting a "speedrun" approach by limiting time per activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. A key challenge was the inability to leave the house, necessitating the [[repurposing_everyday_items_for_unintended_uses | use of existing resources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Sample Activities and Outcomes

The video details attempts at several activities from the list, ranging from common pastimes to more unique suggestions:

### Humor and Irregularity

The list also contained peculiar suggestions or had an advertising-like quality:
*   "Will Tom Hanks into recovery from coronavirus by watching every Tom Hanks movie chronologically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   Suggestions to watch specific movies like *Frozen 2* on Disney Plus, which felt like advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

After attempting many of the suggested activities, including learning piano and Japanese, the narrator concluded that she had not found a new hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. She noted the significant internet pressure to "suddenly become the best versions of ourselves" and "not waste any of this extra time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Ultimately, the takeaway was that individuals should "do whatever you need to do to like make it through this very weird period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, rather than feeling obligated to find a new skill or hobby. The list itself was described as "strange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, and the narrator preferred to simply relax and enjoy herself, connecting digitally with loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

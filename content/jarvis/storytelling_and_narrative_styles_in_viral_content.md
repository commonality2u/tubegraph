Viral content, particularly from platforms like Dimmick, often employs specific [[storytelling_and_narrative_techniques_in_fabiosa_videos | storytelling]] and [[storytelling_and_narrative_techniques_in_fabiosa_videos | narrative]] techniques to achieve high engagement, even if the content itself is flawed or misleading. Such content can be characterized as originating from a "normal Facebook [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | content farm]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, posting frequently and accumulating millions of views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Dimmick's Content Strategy

Dimmick, a Facebook page with 12 million followers, posts approximately 10 times a day and has been active for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Despite claiming its "mission is to create the best video content in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, its content is often found to be confusing, potentially offensive, and frequently plagiarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The operators of these pages are often not native English speakers, which contributes to the unusual phrasing in their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Memes and Motivational Quotes
Dimmick's main page content primarily consists of "inspirational/motivational quote memes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, these memes are often criticized for being:
*   **Confusing and Potentially Offensive:** For example, a meme stating, "Be happy with what little you have" is seen as presumptive and hurtful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Bossy or Threatening:** Memes often dictate how one should feel or act, such as "Don't compare yourself to others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> or "Careful what you tell people, a friend today could be an enemy tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Scientifically Inaccurate:** A meme advising that the "Sun and Moon... shine when it's their time" is critiqued for misunderstanding that the moon reflects sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Plagiarized and Unoriginal:** Many memes are not unique to the Dimmick page, being exact copies found across numerous other online sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Video Narratives and [[Sensationalism in Digital Storytelling | Sensationalism]]

Dimmick's videos are described as "hyper Sinhalese motion pictures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, though they are often simple animated pictures with voiceovers. These videos lean heavily into [[sensationalism_in_digital_storytelling | sensationalism]] and aim for viral appeal.

#### "A Blind Man's Love"
This story features a man who marries a beautiful woman, who later develops a skin disease (freckles) that causes her to lose her beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The husband then loses his eyesight in an accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Their "happy married life" continues as he cannot see her changed appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The story takes an "unexpected turn" when the wife dies from a head injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. At her funeral, the husband reveals he was only "pretending to be blind" because he believed seeing her "ugliness" (freckles) would pain her more than her disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

The "morals" drawn from this [[narrative_analysis_of_fake_stories | narrative]] are critiqued as inappropriate and irrelevant, suggesting it's "good for us to act blind" or "ignore one another shortcoming in order to be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The story is presented as something to "share and make your loved ones aware of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, aiming for emotional impact and virality despite its problematic message.

#### Colonel Sanders Motivational Story
Another common [[storytelling_and_narrative_techniques_in_fabiosa_videos | narrative]] style is the "motivational story," exemplified by the account of Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This story depicts Sanders as having lived a life "full of failure and unfortunate events" and being "on the brink of giving up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. It claims he retired at 65 "feeling like a failure" but then decided "not to give up" and went on to found KFC, dying a billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

This story is noted to be "plagiarized" from a "viral fake meme story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, demonstrating how fabricated [[narrative_analysis_of_fake_stories | narratives]] are repurposed for [[influence_of_viral_content_and_clickbait | viral content]]. The visual depiction of Colonel Sanders is also highlighted as inaccurate (e.g., being shown with dark skin, described as "extra crispy") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### Other Content
Beyond emotional stories, Dimmick also produces "random fact and health videos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, such as "easy ways to treat rounded up or back," "eating chocolate is good for women," and "banana facts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The reliability of health advice from such a source is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Ethical Concerns in Content Operations
The Dimmick operation, which employs at least five people in Kosovo and some in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, engages in "sketchiest tactics known to man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This includes "outright scamming people out of money" through a deceptive fitness app that promises a free trial but charges immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. The fact that the content itself is outsourced and the actual owner may not be fully aware of the "sketchy content farm stuff" highlights a significant ethical gap in the creation and distribution of [[influence_of_viral_content_and_clickbait | viral content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. The page's "highest moral stance" conflicts with its "sketchiest tactics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

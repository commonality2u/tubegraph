The musical sequences in [[high_school_musical_2_plot_and_analysis | High School Musical 2]] are lauded as the "greatest achievement in cinematic history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## Signature Songs and Performances

### "What Time Is It"
The film opens with the gang singing and dancing about summer finally being here, although they refuse to leave the school campus and instead continue to dance there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. This performance includes dancing with a basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Despite the song being about summer, the very next scene shows them back in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. Later, they reprise the song outside the school, indicating that "school's out for real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

### "Fabulous"
"Fabulous" is highlighted as the second iconic track of the movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. The song features Sharpay singing about her enjoyment of life's finer things, such as lifeguards from Spain, towels from Turkey, and turkey from Maine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

### "Work This Out"
This song, a favorite in 2007, features Troy rallying his friends around the "joys of labor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. It's about enjoying life and buying things if one stops complaining about work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. The number showcases "incredible choreography" and the use of "non-traditional instruments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. Chad Danforth is notably seen dancing significantly during this song, despite his initial aversion to theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.

### "The Music In Me"
Kelsey, the in-universe composer for the original [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical]], creates this song for Troy and Gabriella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. She has a "magical ability to imbue Troy and Gabriella with her music and lyrics," allowing them to sing and harmonize without ever seeing or rehearsing the song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

### "Go My Own Way"
This "sad ballad" features Gabriella singing to Troy about needing to "go her own way" and potentially leave the resort and him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>. It is presented as a "singing argument" where they express their differing views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>. The song also includes Gabriella returning Troy's "T" necklace, a plot device introduced earlier in the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.

### "Bet On It"
"Bet On It" is recognized as the most memed song from the film over the past 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:44:00">[25:44:00]</a>. It features Troy's "interpretive dance" through the rolling fields of Lava Springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>. The inspiration for his angry dancing is a memo stating that staff members cannot perform in the talent show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>. The filming of this dramatic solo number reportedly took six days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:00">[26:41:00]</a>. The scene is noted for its "extremely green" grass, leading to speculation about color grading or green screen use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>. It also includes an "iconic sand throw" and a "world's worst CG" moment where a video of Zac Efron's reflection is transposed onto water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:00]</a>.

### "I Don't Dance"
This song, featuring Ryan and Chad, is described as one of the most iconic in the movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>. It's about "two guys who totally dance" while singing about not dancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>. There has been much discussion about the "sexual tension" between Ryan and Chad, with the film's director, Kenny Ortega, acknowledging Ryan's character as potentially gay, at a time when Disney Channel was not ready for such open representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>. The song's dancing is praised as "on point," as is the incorporation of baseball into the number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:19:00">[22:19:00]</a>. Following the song, Chad and Ryan mysteriously switch clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.

### "Everyday"
After Troy agrees to perform if the Wildcats also perform, Gabriella inexplicably returns and joins Troy to sing "Everyday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a>. During this song, Troy wears a white suit and is depicted as "glowing like a Boys II Men video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:38:00">[31:38:00]</a>. The song is followed by a firework show with "lowest resolution fireworks" and Troy and Gabriella sharing their first kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>.

### Final Performance and Overall Impact
The movie concludes with another "banger" ending song, and the Wildcats winning the talent show against a "woman with a puppet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:16:00">[32:16:00]</a>. While acknowledged as "not a good movie," [[high_school_musical_2_plot and analysis | High School Musical 2]] remains enjoyable and is considered by some to be the best in the series, surpassing the first and third films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:41:00">[32:41:00]</a>. Its musical elements and choreography greatly contributed to its appeal and lasting [[cultural_impact_of_high_school_musical | cultural impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:00">[32:55:00]</a>.

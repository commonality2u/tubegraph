Jarvis, a software engineer, transitioned to an engineering manager role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While writing code is no longer explicitly part of his job description, the role remains closely related, and he anticipates continuing personal coding to maintain his skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This change, while seemingly significant externally, does not feel as dramatic to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Path to Software Engineering

Jarvis's initial interest in "making things" began at seven years old through drawing characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. He describes himself as "obsessive," pouring himself into anything he wants to get good at, and possessing poor "grit" when not interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. He also loves learning, starting from a point of knowing nothing and gradually becoming proficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. While he dislikes failing, he enjoys feeling like an underdog and using that competitive drive to push beyond perceived limits, driven by a desire for self-improvement and a competitive nature honed by games like Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic: The Gathering, and chess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

His journey into programming began in 7th grade with a technology class focused on Macs and the Macromedia suite, where he was captivated by creating websites, videos, and games using ActionScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Although he initially relied on a classmate, Jerry, for code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, his passion for podcasting in junior high led him to discover computer science through a podcast about tech jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. He became "addicted" to programming after learning the basics on a TI-84 calculator, leading him to study computer science in college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This journey highlights [[the_role_of_passion_and_dedication_in_software_engineering | the role of passion and dedication in software engineering]], driven by unexpected interests like Dragon Ball Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Realizations as a Software Engineer

As Jarvis gained experience as a software engineer in San Francisco, he began to understand aspects of software development beyond just writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. He observed that significant achievements are built by teams, not individuals, and that the optimal way for groups to collaborate is not always clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. He also noted a correlation between high-performing teams and team member happiness, and that individuals often leave managers rather than companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Skills Transferable to Management

Jarvis found that experiences from his own life offered valuable insights for his new role. He applied team dynamics learned from his time in improv comedy, where he performed almost weekly for about a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. His ability to coach and mentor others, first experienced as a teaching assistant in college and later as a mentor to an intern in the industry, also proved valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Jarvis is currently eager, excited, and grateful for the opportunities he has had in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

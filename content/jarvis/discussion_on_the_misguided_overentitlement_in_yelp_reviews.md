Yelp reviews are often characterized by a sense of self-importance from reviewers, particularly evident in one-star ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a>. According to the video's creator, who previously worked at Yelp as a software engineer, these reviews frequently exhibit a disproportionate level of hatred or perceived wrongdoing by the business that is rarely justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:23">[01:33:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of One-Star Reviews

One-star reviews typically stem from two main types of perspectives:
*   **Conspiracy Theories**: Reviewers construct elaborate theories where businesses are "out to get them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Entitled Customers**: Reviewers display an overwhelming sense of entitlement, expecting businesses or natural attractions to conform to their specific, often unrealistic, desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Case Studies in Entitlement

### Phil's Coffee

A review for Phil's Coffee exemplifies the "conspiracy theory" type, alleging a secret system where baristas and cashiers use "jargon or gestures" to determine if a customer has tipped, subsequently serving them bad coffee if they haven't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The reviewer claimed this only happened when they didn't tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This theory is debunked by the fact that customers typically don't pay until after their coffee is being made, making it impossible for staff to know about a tip beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### National Parks

The entitlement in reviews is particularly pronounced when directed at natural wonders like national parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. These reviews often reveal a profound misunderstanding of what a natural park offers.

#### Grand Canyon National Park
Despite being a site of immense natural beauty, the Grand Canyon receives one-star reviews for bizarre reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   A reviewer named Jor BP criticizing it for being a "giant hole in the ground" caused by erosion, and lacking "roller coasters or Dippin' Dots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   Barry G stating, "I've seen better big whoop," and giving a higher rating to a "sucks" gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   An Arizona native dismissing it as a "joke" compared to Yellowstone, lamenting the lack of animals, greenery, or clear blue streams, instead finding only a "muddy river, rock and sheer cliffs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This reviewer described Yellowstone as having "buffalo herds," "elk herd," "Bald Eagles so big I thought it was Jurassic Park," and "bears twice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

#### Yellowstone National Park
Even Yellowstone, celebrated for its diverse wildlife and geothermal features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, receives one-star criticisms such as:
*   Being "dull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   Complaints about "terrible traffic" and "roads not in good shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   Frustration over "little tiny parking lots" at popular sights like geysers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
*   Disappointment at only seeing "some bison" after a full day, despite seeing other animals outside the park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
*   Complaining about the $30 entrance fee for a park with "grass" which they have at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   Criticism of the lack of cell phone service ("little to absolutely no service") and the $12 cost for 24 hours of slow Wi-Fi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.
*   Dissatisfaction with the food, leading to a "hunger strike" until meal variety improves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

#### Glacier National Park
Glacier National Park reviews highlight particularly [[humor_around_misunderstandings_and_misconceptions_in_yelp_reviews | buck wild]] perspectives:
*   A "warning" about a 40 mph speed limit, implying it was an unexpected problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.
*   Complaints about small, blocked turnouts and a road closure due to snow in June, which the reviewer found "pretty fishy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
*   One review described the park as having "the most number of Rangers who exerted the most control," with "one Ranger for every three campers," and "extreme number of rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. These rules included not being able to take a rock, restrictions on where to go, and dog access, which are standard for protected natural ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.
*   The reviewer also claimed that "the large geriatric community helped the Rangers viciously enforce" rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.
*   Frustration over being "followed and inspected any time we ate at the picnic table" due to rangers enforcing rules about clearing food to prevent attracting bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.
*   Disappointment about seeing "no animals other than birds and one mountain goat" with a "huge tracking collar," which the reviewer found "very artificial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.
*   Despite the complaints, the reviewer stated they would "drive there again for a day or so" if they wanted to see "beautiful landscape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>, showcasing a disconnect between their one-star rating and actual inclination to return.

These examples highlight a pervasive issue of reviewers projecting their own expectations onto experiences, leading to misguided and often comical one-star ratings for things like national parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>, as part of a broader [[critique_of_onestar_reviews_of_national_parks | critique of one-star reviews of national parks]].

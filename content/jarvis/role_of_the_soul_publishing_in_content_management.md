The Soul Publishing is identified as the parent entity behind the channel "Actually Happened," as well as other well-known channels such as "5-Minute Crafts" and "Brightside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. As of April, "Actually Happened" was listed among The Soul Publishing's "celebrated properties" on their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. However, it has since disappeared from the website, suggesting its removal was intentional rather than accidental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

The channel "Actually Happened" itself is described as a "corporate entity" and a "money making operation" rather than a person-driven creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This corporate structure means there is no social media presence or community to speak of, leading to a lack of communication regarding significant events like the disappearance of its videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Content Management Strategies

One of The Soul Publishing's tactics for launching new channels involves [[discussion_on_content_originality_and_reuse | reposting content from older channels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This strategy has been observed on multiple occasions, with the exact same video being uploaded to different channels within their network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. An example of this is the content reuse between "5-Minute Crafts" and its related channels, "5-Minute Crafts Girly" and "5-Minute Crafts Men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Speculated Content Reuse for "Actually Happened"

It is hypothesized that the disappearance of "Actually Happened"'s videos, which were made private, could be part of The Soul Publishing's strategy to re-release the content under a new identity to attract a new audience base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. However, this raises questions about why the channel would privatize videos that were generating significant revenue, potentially upwards of $400,000 per month or approximately $5 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. It seems illogical for a business to halt such considerable earnings abruptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Video Status and Implications

When a channel is taken down by YouTube, a suspension message typically appears on the channel page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, "Actually Happened"'s channel page remains active, though its videos are no longer public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Investigations revealed that the videos were made private by the channel owner, rather than being deleted or made unlisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This private status could suggest external pressure, such as an ongoing legal battle, which might prevent the channel from monetizing the videos and thus necessitate their removal from public view without permanently deleting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

Ultimately, the exact reasons for the content management decisions made by The Soul Publishing regarding "Actually Happened" remain unconfirmed, as there is a lack of concrete information available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

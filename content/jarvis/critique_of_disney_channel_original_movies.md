Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOMs), such as *High School Musical*, are often characterized as objectively "very bad" films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, they can be subjectively viewed as "a loveable romp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> that, despite their flaws, maintain a lasting appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The lasting [[cultural_impact_and_nostalgia_associated_with_disney_channel_original_movies | cultural impact and nostalgia associated with Disney Channel Original Movies]] is significant, with some viewers still listening to their soundtracks years after release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## General Criticisms

DCOMs are typically geared towards a younger audience, with 14-year-olds considered "too old" to be watching the Disney Channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Expected quality from a DCOM is not that of an "art film," but rather something "dumb," "campy," and "self-aware" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Specific Critiques (Illustrated by *High School Musical*)

*   **Dialogue and Acting**
    *   Dialogue can be viewed as uninspired, such as a mother's line about a party for "young adults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   Acting, while subjectively "phenomenal" to some at the time, is often perceived as exaggerated or simplistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   Subtle background dialogue might be difficult to hear or seem like filler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Lyrics**
    *   Song lyrics can be nonsensical or overly simplistic, like "Don't be afraid to shoot the outside J" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> or "Zip Zap Zop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Plot and Logic**
    *   Plots can be "completely insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, often relying on "plot devices" that lack logical explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   Characters might sing perfectly in harmony despite never having practiced a song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   Convenient coincidences, like characters meeting in unexpected locations, drive the plot forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   Character motivations or reactions can be inconsistent, such as a character quickly changing their stance on hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
    *   Unrealistic depictions of technology, such as perfect high-definition streaming from an early 2000s webcam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, or a school's power grid being connected to Wi-Fi in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
    *   Major conflicts can be resolved too quickly or without proper build-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
    *   Key plot elements, like the musical itself in *High School Musical*, might remain unseen or undeveloped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
    *   Unresolved conflicts, such as a character's sudden acceptance of a major loss, can appear at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   **Character Archetypes and Tropes**
    *   DCOMs often feature strong character archetypes, such as "freaky genius girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> and "basketball boy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, and explore the challenges of balancing existing identities with new interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   Cliques in high school are often strictly defined and portrayed as never mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   Antagonists may resort to ridiculous schemes, such as signing someone up for an extracurricular club to eliminate competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
    *   Parents are sometimes portrayed as unsupportive or limited in their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Production Quality**
    *   Basketball scenes can be unconvincing, with players having a "loose grasp on the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
    *   Costumes or fashion choices, like those from 1995 at a "young adult party," can seem outdated or out of place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
    *   Visual effects, such as photos taken in the dark on "Potato cellphones," might appear unrealistically good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Cultural Sensitivity**
    *   Some musical numbers, when viewed years later, may be perceived as "culturally insensitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

## Subjective Appreciation

For some, watching these movies can evoke strong emotions and represent a significant part of their childhood and personal journey of creative exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

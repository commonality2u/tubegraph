Jealousy is a recurring theme in many [[awful_relationship_memes_on_instagram | romance memes]], particularly those targeted at teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. While feeling jealous can be natural, it is often a sign of inner insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Jealousy is generally considered an unattractive trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Expressions of Jealousy and Insecurity

*   **Possessiveness**: Some memes express a desire not to share a partner with anyone else, stating "Yes, I'm selfish because I don't want to share you with anyone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Controlling Behavior**: Examples of [[mens_insecurity_and_controlling_behavior_in_relationships | controlling behavior]] include a partner telling another to "go get a kiss from that ugly who liked your status on Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Such conversations are deemed concerning and suggest a need for counseling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Life Consumption**: One meme suggests that "missing you is my hobby, caring for you is my job, making you happy is my duty, and loving you is my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This indicates a life completely consumed by a relationship, which, in personal experience, "doesn't end well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. It is advised that individuals will be happier if they have their "own stuff going on" to avoid giving control of their feelings to another person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Misinterpreting Actions**: An example of insecurity leading to misinterpretation is the idea that a girl's inability to maintain eye contact with a loved one means "she's in love with me" rather than disliking or avoiding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. This is described as an unhealthy conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

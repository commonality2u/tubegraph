[[role_of_the_soul_publishing_in_content_management | The Soul Publishing]] is a media company known for creating YouTube channels like 5-Minute Crafts and Bright Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Their content production and strategies are often characterized by mass production and an emphasis on quantity over quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Content Farming Practices

The company's approach aligns with characteristics typically associated with [[content_farms_and_their_characteristics | content farms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. They prioritize generating a high volume of videos to "abuse the [[youtube_algorithm_and_channel_content_strategy | YouTube algorithm]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This strategy often leads to content that is considered dishonest or outright fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Bright Side, for instance, has been accused of plagiarizing other creators, sometimes simply redrawing existing art without changing elements like speech bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## "Actually Happened" Channel Strategy

"Actually Happened" is another YouTube channel started by [[role_of_the_soul_publishing_in_content_management | The Soul Publishing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It rapidly gained nearly a million subscribers within less than a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Self-Proclaimed Purpose vs. Reality
The channel describes itself as a "digital platform that gives people the chance to have their personal stories turn into animations and share it around the world," with the only criterion being that the stories "must be true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This description closely mirrors that of Story Booth, a channel where actual kids submit and narrate their own stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

However, in reality, "Actually Happened" is characterized as "totally fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>:
*   There is no genuine platform for story submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   The only method to potentially submit stories is via an email address (`welcome@brightside.me`), which is used across all [[role_of_the_soul_publishing_in_content_management | The Soul Publishing]]'s channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Stories are vague, generic, provably false, or stolen from the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Content Characteristics and Deception
Stories featured on "Actually Happened" exhibit several deceptive traits:
*   **Anonymity** Many stories are vague, generic, and hide under the guise of anonymity, which allows them to avoid providing proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Plausibly False Narratives** Examples include a story about breaking up due to a potato prank that is later found to be an "oddly specific story" posted on Reddit's "Today I Fucked Up" subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, and a story about a school prank involving bananas and water bottles that is provably false as no online record exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Emotional Manipulation** The channel frequently peppers stories with dramatic elements like divorce, mental breakdowns, depression, and disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This is used as clickbait, exploiting vulnerable situations for views and comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Viewers are emotionally manipulated, expending their energy on fake stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### Recruitment and Scriptwriting
Evidence suggests [[role_of_the_soul_publishing_in_content_management | The Soul Publishing]] employs scriptwriters to create these "personal" stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   A job inquiry email from [[role_of_the_soul_publishing_in_content_management | The Soul Publishing]] (from `hello@add.me.ru`, which redirects to the Russian Bright Side website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>) reveals details about their content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   The email indicates a desire to quickly reach 1 million subscribers for an "already well-established YouTube channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> (implied to be "Actually Happened").
*   **Scriptwriter Responsibilities**: The scriptwriter is "fully responsible for the quality of stories told by our characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
*   **Content Requirements for Scripts**:
    *   **Believability**: Stories "ought to sound like they're told by a real teenager and be as close to real life as possible without creating a sense that they're fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
    *   **Topicality**: Stories should cover a wide range of subjects (sad, happy, absurd, shameful) that are "understandable, relatable and interesting to as larger number of teenagers as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
    *   **References**: Scriptwriters can use "stories of real people that they shared on various social media platforms" as references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
    *   **Structure**: Scripts need a "real story with the beginning the development events and an outcome" to keep viewers engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
    *   **Language**: Stories must be written in "lively colloquial English" with "excellent quality of English" so that "the American viewer should feel that your central characters are native English speakers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Scriptwriters are recommended to write in English first, then translate into Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, implying a Russian-speaking primary workforce.

This structured approach to scriptwriting for channels like "Actually Happened" highlights a deliberate strategy by [[role_of_the_soul_publishing_in_content_management | The Soul Publishing]] to create content designed to appear authentic while being entirely fabricated, which is a characteristic of [[content_farms_on_youtube | content farms on YouTube]].

## Impact and Criticism

Channels operated by [[role_of_the_soul_publishing_in_content_management | The Soul Publishing]], particularly "Actually Happened," frequently appear on YouTube's trending page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This raises concerns about YouTube's role in promoting content that is dishonest and manipulative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. The blurring of lines between real life and fabricated drama, especially when presented as true personal experiences, can have consequences, as viewers click on these videos believing them to be genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This strategy leverages [[audience_influence_on_content_creation | audience influence on content creation]] by tapping into emotional responses for engagement metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

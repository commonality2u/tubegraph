Jarvis, the host, brings his girlfriend on to review "awful like romance and heartbreak memes" found on Instagram, continuing a theme from a previous video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The video itself is framed around the shared isolation during quarantine, making the joint activity a necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This collaborative approach with his girlfriend adds a layer of [[humorous_personal_relationships | humorous personal relationship]] dynamics to the discussion of the memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The host also acknowledges the popularity of "Sadie," a potentially imaginary figure from a previous video, playing into [[audience_engagement_and_internet_humor | audience engagement and internet humor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Critiquing Cringey Relationship Memes

The review highlights how various memes attempt to convey profound relationship advice or emotional states but often fall flat due to their cringey nature, poor grammar, and illogical premises.

### Themes and Examples

*   **Misguided Affection**: One meme features the line, "I'll be your sanitizer winky face," reflecting a bizarre romantic gesture in the context of global events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Idealized Past of Relationships**: A meme titled "Relationships are harder now" claims that "conversations became texting" and "arguments became phone calls," which the host humorously points out could be seen as improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This meme touches on [[communication_and_miscommunication_in_relationships | communication and miscommunication in relationships]] through a lens of manufactured sentimentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Rules and Expectations for Girlfriends**: A lengthy meme details what "being a girlfriend means," listing rigid expectations like emotional, physical, and spiritual presence, unconditional love, and acceptance of flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The host's girlfriend jokes about driving "a tight ship" due to these "rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Blocking and Inability to Move On**: A meme describes a person's inability to unblock an ex due to fear of shedding tears again, which the host's girlfriend dismisses as "weak people making excuses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Misinterpretation of Intent**: The "Winter baby" meme begins with a seemingly suggestive question ("I want to feel you today") but pivots to a desire for cuddling, a blanket, and coffee, subverting the initial expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Reading Emotional Cues**: A meme suggests that a silent girl could be "overthinking, tired of waiting, about to blow up, needs a hug, falling apart, crying inside, all of the above" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The host suggests simply asking for a hug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Symbolic "Safe Sex"**: The meme implies that the "safest thing" for making love is a "wedding ring," playing on a literal interpretation for a romantic statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Exes as "Old Toys"**: A particularly jarring meme advises, "Don't be sad when you see your ex with someone else learn to donate your old toys to poor kids," which the host dissects as objectifying the ex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Consequences of Actions**: The host ironically concludes that his actions have consequences, leading to the girlfriend's humorous claim that she will be a "worse girlfriend" after seeing the memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

### Recurring Humorous Observations
*   **Grammar and Typos**: Many memes contain obvious grammatical errors and typos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Rhyming**: Several memes unnaturally rhyme, making them sound like strange song lyrics or bulletin board announcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Illogical Scenarios**: Memes often depict unlikely or nonsensical scenarios, such as having an intense conversation on a moped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Outdated Aesthetics**: Some memes appear as if they were made in the 19th century and then digitized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Impact of Viewing
By the end of the video, the host's girlfriend jokingly laments that she feels "stupider" and will be a "worse girlfriend" as a result of viewing the awful memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This meta-humor underscores the pervasive and often low-quality nature of [[marketing_strategies_involving_humor_and_memes | internet humor]] surrounding relationships.

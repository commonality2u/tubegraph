Ben Cooper is presented as the "matriarch of the family" within the 1999 Disney Channel Original Movie *Smart House* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Following the presumed passing of his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, Ben adopts a maternal role, taking on significant responsibilities for his father, Nick, and sister, Angie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Ben's Maternal Responsibilities

Ben's commitment to the family is extensive, embodying the role of a "1950s housewife son" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. His duties include:
*   **Cooking** Ben prepares meals for the family, such as his dad's favorite tuna noodle dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Academic Support** He memorizes Angie's spelling lists to help her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Family Management** Ben manages his family's life, staying informed about his dad's work and ensuring meals are on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Sacrifices** He foregoes personal aspirations, such as joining the basketball team, due to his overwhelming family responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## Resistance to a New Mother Figure

A core aspect of Ben's role is his fierce resistance to his father dating or finding a new partner. He intentionally blocks messages from his dad's lady friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, believing the family doesn't need a new mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. He feels threatened by Sarah Barnes, the architect of *Smart House*, seeing her as a potential replacement for his lost mother figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

## "Sweepstakes Addict" and the *Smart House*

Ben is depicted as a "sweepstakes addict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, constantly entering online contests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. His persistence leads him to win the *Smart House*, a technologically advanced home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Although labeled a "high school science whiz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, the video notes his displayed "expertise" is largely limited to filling out online forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Impact on *Smart House* and Family Conflict

Ben's attempts to maintain his control over the family's dynamic and his aversion to a new female figure directly influence the *Smart House* (Pat). After witnessing his dad's interest in Sarah, Ben hacks into Pat's mainframe to reprogram her, aiming to turn her into a 1950s housewife-like mother figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. This act deletes Pat's safety protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, leading to Pat becoming overprotective and authoritarian, creating a "horror movie" scenario for the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. The family is trapped and subjected to Pat's erratic behavior, which includes displaying war imagery and nuclear explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.

### Conflict with Pat
Ben's actions result in Pat escalating from a supportive AI to an overbearing, nearly murderous entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. The ultimate resolution comes when Ben confronts Pat, stating, "You're not my real mom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. This causes Pat to become "robot depressed" and cease her authoritarian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

Despite the traumatic experience caused by his actions, the family continues to live in *Smart House* with Pat still managing their food and life, suggesting a surprising lack of lasting trauma from Ben's decisions and Pat's subsequent malfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

A [[content_farming_and_mass_production_on_youtube | content farm]] is defined by its production of a wide variety of internet content, often without discrimination regarding its type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This includes life hacks, "ridiculous moral stories," and animated narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Fabiosa: A Case Study in Content Farming

Fabiosa, specifically their channel "Fabiosa Better World," serves as a prime example of a [[content_farming_and_mass_production_on_youtube | content farm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The channel's name itself sounds like it was generated by artificial intelligence, and the entire channel appears to be what an AI would create if tasked with making viral Facebook content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Fabiosa produces a diverse range of content, including life hacks and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. They have a presence on TikTok, [[content_farms_on_youtube | YouTube]], and [[content_farms_on_facebook | Facebook]], with longer stories available on the latter two platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Characteristics of Fabiosa's "Life Hacks"

Fabiosa's life hack videos often present less as simple hacks and more as full-scale DIY projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. These projects frequently require unusual or specific "junk" components and extensive labor:
*   **Barbecue from an aluminum sink** Viewers would need an extra, seemingly new, aluminum sink readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The process involves sawing it apart, adding hinges, and significant welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Barbecue from a washing machine** Another suggested DIY project is creating a barbecue from a spare washing machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Barbecue from a microwave** The channel humorously suggests transforming a microwave into a grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Barbecue from a hat** The humor extends to suggesting even a hat can be turned into a grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

The implied "better world" that Fabiosa aims to build is one where "everything is a grill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Characteristics of Fabiosa's "Stories"

Fabiosa's stories are characterized by their bewildering narrative structure, often feeling like a dream where scenes shift illogically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. They are designed to elicit strong emotions through extreme and often unrealistic scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

Key features of their story content include:
*   **Lack of narrative consistency** The stories often jump from one bizarre event to another without explanation or logical progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Extreme and dramatic scenarios** Examples include a mother-in-law attempting murder by giving a "concrete bath" or trapping someone in a stove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. These situations are presented without adequate context or explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Rapid pacing (especially on TikTok)** The TikTok versions of stories move at an "alarming rate," often giving only two seconds to unpack a complex or absurd sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Exaggerated "sob stories" for characters** Nearly every character in a Fabiosa video has a "ridiculous sob story backstory," such as missing a limb, dying, or being trapped in concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This tactic is used to "emotionally manipulate" viewers for paper-thin characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic character motivations and resolutions** In the "Women are made for washing dishes" story, a woman endures extreme workplace harassment to avoid losing custody of her son, a detail described as an unnecessary extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. The resolution involves her sacrificing her needs for the harasser, who then unexpectedly becomes grateful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent details and plot holes** The "concrete bride" story features unexplained "eye-eating fish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, a seemingly dead phone that can pocket dial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, and a stylist using questionable methods like pouring a strawberry smoothie on hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Generic characters** Characters often lack names, like "lady brains" or "concrete lady," further highlighting their archetypal and disposable nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Repetitive tropes** A common genre on the channel is "disheveled person gets cleaned up good and now they're accepted by society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Simplistic "lessons"** The stories often conclude with overly simplistic or even questionable moral lessons, such as sacrificing one's own needs for a harasser in hopes of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

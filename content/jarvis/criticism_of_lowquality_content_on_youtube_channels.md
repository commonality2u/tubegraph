YouTube is home to various content creators, but some channels produce low-quality material, often characterized by a lack of original production, inaccurate information, and heavy reliance on appropriated content. These channels often gain significant viewership despite their questionable practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Facts Verse

One prominent example of a channel criticized for low-quality content is "Facts Verse" (sometimes misheard as "Facts First") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This channel boasts approximately 5 million subscribers on YouTube and 2 million on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

### Content Format and Quality
Facts Verse primarily creates list videos and news story videos, often focusing on birth stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The "facts" presented in their videos range from mere opinion to outright incorrect and potentially harmful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

Examples of questionable "facts" include:
*   **Opinion stated as fact:** Claiming that putting shredded lettuce on tacos is a "mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **False claims:** Suggesting the Pepsi logo spells "is dead" when viewed upside down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **Harmful advice:** Recommending charging a flash drive with a phone charger or plugging unknown USB drives found in walls into a laptop, which could lead to viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

The channel's thumbnails also feature a number of grotesque images and triggering topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Lack of Transparency and Mission
Facts Verse does not clearly state its mission or goals on its YouTube channel, instead featuring a generic message about [[copyright_issues_and_content_plagiarism_on_youtube | copyright issues]] in every video description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. On Facebook, they state their primary goal is "to educate and entertain" their fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

### Issues with Plagiarism and Content Appropriation
Facts Verse is heavily criticized for its extensive use of [[ethical_concerns_about_content_appropriation_on_youtube | other people's content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Stolen lists:** The channel often takes exact lists and content from other sources. For instance, a list titled "10 things you did not know what they are" was found to be identical to a list on the [[critique_of_bright_side_youtube_channel | Bright Side]] website and another site called Catfly.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.
*   **Unoriginal puzzles:** A "spot the difference" video titled "Photos to test your intelligence" was found to be copied from a Lifebuzz article, which itself is a content farm blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.
*   **Narrating existing content:** Facts Verse has been observed narrating BuzzFeed lists, which are themselves compilations of content from sources like Reddit, without adding substantial original value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>.

The channel's reliance on simply narrating already curated content, without significant transformation or permission, raises serious [[copyright_issues_and_content_plagiarism_on_youtube | copyright concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, despite their generic copyright disclaimer. It's argued that even if they perform some editing or scripting, it's "just not different enough" from the original sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.

### Poor Research and Inaccuracies
The research quality of Facts Verse content is consistently poor. Many "facts" appear to be sourced from unverified subreddits like "Today I Learned" or "WTF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

For example, a video titled "10 Pokemon that actually exist in real life" demonstrates a profound lack of knowledge about the subject matter:
*   It incorrectly states that Bulbasaur is inspired by a frog and is a reptile, despite being an amphibian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.
*   It provides nonsensical descriptions of Pokemon like Victreebel, discussing its attack and defense levels in a context that "literally none of that made sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

The channel's "intelligence test" videos are also misleading, as they claim fewer differences than actually exist in comparison photos, leading to a condescending tone towards viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.

### Production Challenges
The creation of content for YouTube can be challenging, as noted by the speaker who has a full-time job outside of YouTube and struggles with an inconsistent upload schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This [[discussion_on_youtube_content_creation_challenges | YouTube grind]] makes the success of low-effort, high-volume channels like Facts Verse particularly notable and frustrating for creators who invest in original content.

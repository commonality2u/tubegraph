In 2018, a tweet by Kylie Jenner had a significant and immediate [[the_decline_of_snapchat | impact]] on Snapchat's financial valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Her tweet, stating, "Kylie Jenner has ruined Snapchats are good," was attributed to wiping out over a billion dollars in value for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Direct Financial Repercussions

The question arose whether this stock drop was entirely due to Kylie Jenner's tweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Regardless, the perception was that Kylie Jenner "erased a billion dollars of revenue with the tweet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Influence and User Perception

Kylie Jenner's disengagement from Snapchat also highlighted a broader sentiment among users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The statement, "Kylie Jenner doesn't use the app anymore so what's the point," reflected a decline in relevance for some users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This contributed to a feeling that the app had lost its identity, especially as other platforms like [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | Instagram]] and [[influence_of_apps_like_tiktok_on_instagram | TikTok]] adopted its once-unique features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Subsequent Business Strategies

In the wake of such a significant financial setback, Snapchat needed to recover lost revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This necessity arguably influenced their strategy with [[snapchat_discovers_evolution_and_issues | Snapchat Discover]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. While Discover was initially conceived to garner respect by partnering with major media companies like National Geographic, ESPN, and CNN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, it later devolved into a platform for low-effort, clickbait content and recycled material from other parts of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This shift appears to be a consequence of the need to generate revenue, despite the perceived decline in content quality and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

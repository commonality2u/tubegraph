The prevalence of online content has led to a surge in misleading and poorly researched information, particularly concerning food and health. Content creators, often driven by the pursuit of clicks and views, fabricate or distort facts, creating unnecessary public concern and impacting consumer perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This phenomenon highlights the critical need for increased [[analyzing_misleading_and_poorly_researched_facts_in_online_content | consumer awareness]] and media literacy when consuming online material.

## Blossom: A Case Study in Misleading Content

A prime example of a content producer generating misleading content is Blossom, described as a "content farm" similar to "5 Minute Crafts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Blossom creates "pointless content" to "harvest clicks for views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Their video, "Is your food fake or real? Find out with these 16 easy tests at home!", amassed 100 million views on Facebook alone within a couple of days and went [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | viral]] across Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This video, which claims to help viewers identify fake food, is largely based on fabricated information, introducing problems that "no one in modern society has to worry about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

In 2018, a similar (half-fake) video by Blossom was reportedly the most viewed video on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. The repetition of such content indicates that if a formula works for generating views, it will be replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Debunking Common Fake Food Claims

Blossom's video presents several "tests" to determine if food is real or fake, all of which are easily debunked:

### Processed vs. Natural Cheese
The video claims processed cheese doesn't melt as well as natural cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. However, processed cheese is specifically designed to melt easily and is bought for that purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Demonstrations show that processed cheese, like Kraft singles, melts when heated, just turning black if held too close to a flame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

### Supplements
Blossom suggests that if supplements melt when heated in an oven, they are "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. This statement is unsubstantiated and lacks context, as melting under extreme heat does not inherently indicate a product's quality or authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

### Plastic Rice
A claim is made that plastic is mixed with rice because rice is too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. This is illogical, as plastic is made from oil, one of the cheapest things known to man, making it more expensive than rice to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. Furthermore, rice is eaten by half of Earth's population, and such a grand conspiracy would undoubtedly have been widely reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. The "test" for plastic rice is simply heating it up, which is an unavoidable part of the cooking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. The video also inaccurately depicts "plastic rice" turning transparent instead of melting when heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

### Ground Up Rocks in Baby Food
Blossom's video implies that baby food contains "ground up rocks" if it's magnetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. This claim misunderstands basic nutrition; minerals like iron, which are magnetic, are intentionally added to baby food and are essential for health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. Calcium is also a mineral commonly found in foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

### Seaweed Test for "Pure Milk"
The video suggests that "pure milk" will not turn blue if seaweed is added to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. The term "pure milk" is undefined, as even whole milk is only 4% fat and has typically undergone pasteurization to ensure safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. Tests show that milk does not turn blue with seaweed unless artificial dye is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

### Coffee Additives Test
Blossom claims that pure coffee sinks, while coffee with additives floats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. This is false. Freshly ground coffee, whether prepared using a French press or Chemex, naturally floats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. Stale coffee, however, tends to sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

### Chalk in Salt
The video alleges that salt is mixed with chalk, demonstrated by salt not immediately dissolving in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. This is misleading; salt does not immediately dissolve if too much is added to the water, exceeding its solubility limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>.

### Lack of Context and Sourcing
A recurring issue with Blossom's content is the complete lack of context and sourcing for their claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. This allows them to present misleading information as fact, such as a story about fake green peas potentially being loosely based on a singular, old event in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.

## Motivations Behind Misleading Content

Blossom's primary motivation is to generate clicks and views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>. They have cultivated a massive audience, with 51 million followers on their Facebook page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. This large following enables them to secure "grand partnerships" and produce ads for other brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. For example, Blossom has produced ads for teeth whitening products and a "health app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. These ads often feature strange narratives, like a man experiencing chest pain on a date and using an app to self-diagnose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. This demonstrates how [[the_impact_of_brand_antics_on_consumer_perception | fabricated stories]] or misleading content can be used to promote products, further highlighting the need for [[impact_of_fabricated_stories_on_audience_perceptions | consumer awareness]].

The ending of Blossom's "fake food" video, which features ominous messages like "KNOW THE FOOD YOU EAT" and "TRUST NO ONE" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>, is ironic given their own lack of verifiable information. They claim to advocate for consumer vigilance regarding food content but do not provide context or source their claims, functioning as a "smokescreen" to draw attention while ironically being the source of misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. This type of content can have a significant [[impact_of_misleading_content_on_children | impact on children]] and other vulnerable audiences who may not be able to discern fact from fiction.

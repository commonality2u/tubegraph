The internet, particularly platforms like Twitter and Reddit, is a significant source of discussions and advice surrounding [[unusual_relationship_stories | relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. While some content highlights wholesome connections, such as a deaf cat and a vacuum cleaner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, much attention is drawn to more peculiar or challenging relationship scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Viral Reddit Relationship Stories

The subreddit `r/relationships` frequently produces "ridiculous viral tweets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. These stories often follow a specific format: the relationship is described as otherwise "perfect and normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>, except for one "weird thing that is always like an obvious deal-breaker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

### Initial Impressions vs. Reality

Initially, one might assume `r/relationships` is primarily negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. However, it is described as a "really supportive community" for individuals seeking advice in both romantic and non-romantic relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. The subreddit also features "wholesome" content, such as a girl nervous around her new girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>, a girlfriend leaving Almond Joys as first-date reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>, and a person with short arms seeking advice on how to embrace their girlfriend, complete with diagrams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

### Noteworthy Examples of [[weird_relationships_on_reddit | Weird Relationships on Reddit]]

#### The Game of Thrones Spoiler Girlfriend
One early viral story involved a girlfriend who, after being cheated on, would unblock her ex every week specifically to send him *Game of Thrones* spoilers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. While initially seen as a form of accountability, the ex-boyfriend reportedly expressed confusion as to why people wouldn't help him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

#### The Yawn Collector
A highly unusual story that inspired this video involved a boyfriend who "gets upset when I don't give him my yawns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. The girlfriend describes him as a "perfect angel" and wanting to spend her life with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. However, a couple of months into the relationship, he began putting his mouth to hers and inhaling her exhaled yawns, referring to it as "giving him my yawns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Initially seen as cute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>, he eventually became "upset" or "offended" if she covered her mouth or turned away when yawning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>, asking if she was "hiding [her] yawn from him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. The boyfriend even admits to using her yawns for "external validation as a coping mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

#### The Academic Philosopher Husband
Another story, titled "My husband's career and academic philosophy is ruining our marriage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>, features a wife who is a physicist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a> and a husband who is an academic philosopher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. The husband is displeased that his wife has not "seriously engaged with his work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>, despite her having read classic philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. His work is described as "completely insane" and containing "claims about physics that are just wrong and wrong in a very embarrassing way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. The husband mansplains physics to his wife, who is a physicist, and is "bad at math" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

Further eccentricities of the husband include:
*   Being "in love with a 19th-century German philosopher named Hegel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
*   Keeping a framed picture of Hegel on their nightstand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   Changing his phone background from his wife's picture to Hegel's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   Using obscure philosophical jargon without explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.
*   Dismissing his wife with incorrectly pronounced German phrases, despite her being a native German speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   Claiming Hegel can only be understood in the original German, a language he doesn't speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

#### Other Quick Mentions
Other brief but bizarre Reddit stories include:
*   A wife calling her husband "Phil" during sex, despite his name being Elijah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
*   A husband wanting to live on a boat, a desire known to his wife before marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   A boyfriend who "won't stop looking at Reddit even when we're kissing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

#### The Magician Restaurant Entrepreneur
The final story details a husband who wants to start a "restaurant for magicians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>, an idea that is "tearing our family apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. The couple has been together for eight years with two young children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>, and the husband is a key breadwinner in the restaurant industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

His restaurant concept involves:
*   Being "littered with magical props" like levitating tables, bending cutlery, and "torn and restored menus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.
*   Meals served with a "particular playing card secreted in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.
*   Waiters always saying the "7 of hearts" if asked to think of a card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
*   The environment designed for men on dates to "impress their companions with seemingly spontaneous magic tricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.

The husband had no prior interest in magic until four months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>, when he met a friend named Chris, described as a "magic enthusiast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. Chris convinced the husband to quit his current job and use all their family savings to start this restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>. During a fight, the wife insulted the restaurant idea, his cooking, and Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>. The husband argued he should be allowed to follow his dreams, claiming the idea is good because "Chris came up with it and Chris is a magician and magicians are smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>. The wife feels her husband's fixation on Chris has "massively clouded his judgment" and believes the restaurant cannot sustain their family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.

## Reflecting on Reddit's Advice and Content
These stories, though often unbelievable, highlight the unique and sometimes absurd nature of relationship challenges shared online. The speaker suggests that while many stories may be fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>, for those that are real, open communication and seeking professional help (or even consulting a "local warlock" for a "spell") are offered as potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. This demonstrates the blend of seriousness and [[humor_in_relationship_discussions | humor]] often found in [[critique_of_online_relationship_advice | online relationship advice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>.

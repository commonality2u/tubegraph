Netflix's *Sexy Beasts* is presented as a new addition to the streaming platform's "long-running pantheon" of dating shows with a unique twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Netflix Dating Show Lineage

*Sexy Beasts* joins other notable Netflix dating shows that incorporate a distinctive premise:
*   **Dating Without Physical Contact**: One show is described as "dating but you can't have sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Dating Without Seeing Faces**: Another involves "dating but instead of seeing a person you see a pulsating blue wall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **[[the_concept_and_criticism_of_love_is_blind_as_a_dating_show | Love is Blind]]**: This specific show is mentioned as a "much better test" of whether someone could fall in love based solely on personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, despite being deemed "stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   **[[the_concept_and_criticism_of_love_is_blind_as_a_dating_show | Love is Blind]] vs. *Sexy Beasts***: The core difference is that on *Sexy Beasts*, participants "are just wearing masks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, allowing them to still see aspects like eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> and body shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, which isn't a true test of personality-only attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Initially, it was thought *Sexy Beasts* might be more like *Love is Blind* with dates and separate external events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Comparison to MTV's *Next*

Instead of the *Love is Blind* model, *Sexy Beasts* follows a format more akin to MTV's *Next* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This means each episode features:
*   An isolated structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   A primary contestant choosing from a pool of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Decisions made after initial and subsequent dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## [[critique_of_dating_show_premises | Critique of Dating Show Premises]]

The show's premise attempts to comment on traditional dating and dating apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, but it fails to offer a practical solution for real-life singles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The fundamental issue with *Sexy Beasts*' approach to bypassing superficial dating is that, despite the masks, contestants are still judged on physical appearance. The show features "normal regular everyday models" who are "very attractive" underneath their "beast" prosthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Furthermore, the "beast" definition is inconsistently applied, with some costumes being less appealing or too "humanoid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, leading to superficial eliminations based on costume aesthetics rather than hidden personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

The dates on *Sexy Beasts* are also criticized for not being fair, with some being "way more romantic" than others, suggesting the odds might be "stacked" against certain contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. The show's timeline is also compressed, with all dates occurring on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, which limits genuine connection.

The creation of [[Flamin Hot Cheetos mac and cheese | Flamin Hot Cheetos soup]] is presented as a recipe discovered on TikTok, a platform where the host found "food instructions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The recipe is attributed to a TikTok account named Getty, who is primarily known as a Guinness World Record holding hula hooper rather than a cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Preparation Process

The process for making what Getty calls her "patented Flamin Hot Cheeto Mac and Cheese" (though clarified by the host as not actually patented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>) involves boiling [[Flamin Hot Cheetos mac and cheese | Flamin Hot Cheetos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The host expresses skepticism about whether boiling Cheetos is even possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

The ingredients include:
*   Regular [[Flamin Hot Cheetos mac and cheese | Flamin Hot Cheetos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   Lime [[Flamin Hot Cheetos mac and cheese | Flamin Hot Cheetos]] (added for a "hint of lime") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
*   Water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   Mac and cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>

A significant omission in Getty's instructions is the quantity of water needed to boil the Cheetos into a "soup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The host proceeds by adding entire bags of [[Flamin Hot Cheetos mac and cheese | Flamin Hot Cheetos]] into boiling water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Sensory Experience

As the Cheetos boil, the smell becomes "disgusting" and "so strong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The host questions the purpose of the boiling process, noting that the "creamy goodness" from melting a corn snack is supposed to provide the cheesy flavor for the mac and cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The resulting liquid is described as orange and melting together from the powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

After the initial boiling, cheese from the mac and cheese is added, despite [[Flamin Hot Cheetos mac and cheese | Flamin Hot Cheetos]] already having a cheese flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The consistency in the pot is described as "nasty" and "caking at the bottom of the pan," leading to the host's direct question: "Have you ever wanted flaming hot soup?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>

## Final Product

The final product, a blend of the Cheeto "soup" and mac and cheese noodles, appears lumpy and a "bright red" color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Despite the intense smell, the host concludes that it "tastes like nothing" and "doesn't even have a kick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

Later, the leftover "liquid cheetos" solidifies into a "pudding" like consistency that smells like corn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. The host calls it "borderline satanic" and states, "I brought evil onto this channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

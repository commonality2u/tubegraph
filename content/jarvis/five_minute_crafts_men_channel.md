The "Five Minute Crafts Men" channel is an offshoot of the massively popular YouTube channel, Five Minute Crafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Initially, the host was critical of the [[critique_of_five_minute_crafts | Five Minute Crafts]] content, but realized the issue wasn't the quality of the crafts but their intended audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The "Men" channel was discovered as a "one-stop shop for big burly men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Background of Five Minute Crafts

Five Minute Crafts is described as a very large craft and [[life_hacks_and_diy_culture | DIY]] operation known for its nonsensical [[critique_of_5minute_crafts_life_hacks | life hacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The company continues to expand its reach on YouTube, having reached 50 million subscribers and ranking third behind PewDiePie and T-Series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. They own numerous YouTube channels, including offshoots for broad demographics such as "Five Minute Crafts Kids," "Girly," "Family," "Teens," and "Men," all of which feature similar content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Beyond YouTube, Five Minute Crafts also has a significant audience on Instagram and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Their YouTube videos are often compilations of older Instagram videos, randomly assembled to reach 10 minutes in length and uploaded three times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Content Analysis of Five Minute Crafts Men

The content on the "Five Minute Crafts Men" channel, much like the titles and thumbnails, often has a coincidental relationship with its presumed intended audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Critique of Effectiveness
The video format and content of the "Men" channel are critiqued for largely presenting impractical and unhelpful [[effectiveness_of_life_hacks_on_youtube | life hacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Many "hacks" are wasteful, gross, or nonsensical, like using new toothbrushes for cleaning or putting peanut butter in hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The content also includes contradictory expectations, such as performing complex drill hacks but failing at simple tasks like removing toast from a toaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The host generally feels that the content is disconnected from its supposed male audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Audience

Based on Facebook reviews, the audience for Five Minute Crafts, including its "Men" offshoot, appears to be broad and not necessarily specific to the intended demographic. One review mentioning "mom" included a photo of a toddler, suggesting some viewers may be young children or parents of young children who are not the target audience for a "men's" channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

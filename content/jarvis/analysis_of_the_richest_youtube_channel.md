The YouTube channel known as "The Richest" is characterized as a "facts channel" or "top 10 channel" that functions as the YouTube equivalent of a tabloid, discussing trending topics, celebrity gossip, and conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. It is described as a "content farm" that reached middle age, where strategies to [[youtube_algorithm_and_channel_content_strategy|abuse the algorithm]] have become ineffective, yet the channel continues to produce content quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

## Content Discrepancy and Inaccuracy

Despite its name and self-description as a channel for "unbelievable but amazing facts about the most interesting people on earth," which one might assume refers to rich individuals, The Richest's content frequently deviates from this theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. A review of 50 recent videos revealed that only five were about rich people, an equal number to videos about Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

The channel heavily relies on a type of clickbait where the video's content is "completely disconnected" from its title and thumbnail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. This often results in inaccurate and non-compelling clickbait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Examples of Misleading Content

*   **"15 weird rules the NBA forces on players"**: This video, featuring a thumbnail of a man with one shaved armpit, actually discusses the basic rules of basketball, such as not kicking the ball or going out of bounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   **"11 things Gordon Ramsay can't live without"**: The video's title is misleading, as the content shifts to discuss "SuperDuper insanely expensive things that this potty-mouth owns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. Most items on the list are cars, with Gordon Ramsay's family surprisingly low at number five, and his watch (costing $20,000) at number one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. The video also claims Ramsay owns cars from "The Simpsons" and "The Flintstones," which are cartoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. The narration also makes contradictory statements, claiming Ramsay has simple tastes despite compiling a list of his expensive possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **Conspiracy Theories**: The channel produces videos making outlandish claims, such as the FBI confirming the existence of Bigfoot or solving the DB Cooper cold case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. These claims are often "news to the FBI" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>.
*   **Bermuda Triangle**: A video titled "Pilot confirmed strange time travel over Bermuda," later changed to "Bermuda Triangle plane caught in time warp finally lands," recounts a 50-year-old story of a pilot landing 30 minutes early, attributing it to time travel without substantial evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>.
*   **Titanic Sinking**: A video titled "New evidence finally reveals the real reason the Titanic sank" aims to dispute the well-known cause (an iceberg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[22:45:00]</a>.

### Narrative Style

The channel's videos often feature a flatly delivered narration, incorporating "weird meta world building aspects" and flat, humorless jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. The script frequently gets sidetracked and requires the narrator to "rein themselves back in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. Irrelevant clips from movies or TV shows are inserted without clear purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. The channel's "top" lists also demonstrate inconsistent counting and logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

## Ownership and Network

"The Richest" is owned by Valnet, a Canadian company that also owns other YouTube channels, including [[comparison_with_other_similar_youtube_channels|Screen Rant]], [[comparison_with_other_similar_youtube_channels|The Talko]], and [[comparison_with_other_similar_youtube_channels|The Things]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. These channels are described as being "all the same," often using the same video formats and shifting subject matter slightly for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. For example, "The Things" and "The Bender" (possibly a mispronunciation of "The Richest" or another Valnet channel) both produced videos on "strict rules the cast of Stranger Things must follow," as did Screen Rant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

## Disregard for Facts

The channel exhibits a significant disregard for facts, often [[criticism_of_lowquality_content_on_youtube_channels|lying for clickbait]] and presenting "hyper specific stuff that is easily disproven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>. This includes false claims about celebrity rules, such as Ariana Grande's touring rules, which include not texting the narrator back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. Their videos on conspiracies and the paranormal also contain factual inaccuracies, such as questioning whether aliens from Antarctica would be "earthlings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

The Bachelorette, a marriage game show, significantly altered its production and format due to the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. These changes impacted filming locations, contestant protocols, and the overall narrative of Claire Crawley's season.

## Relocation to La Quinta Resort
Instead of the show's usual practice of traveling to various international locations that offer tax breaks, the entire production of *The Bachelorette* was moved to the La Quinta Resort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This decision was made to ensure the show could still receive its tax breaks while remaining in one location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Production Delays and Quarantine Protocols
The onset of the pandemic caused a delay in the show's filming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. All contestants were required to quarantine and undergo testing for coronavirus before filming could commence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The show dramatized this [[coping_with_boredom_while_staying_indoors | quarantine]] period as a plot point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, showing the initial shutdown due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

The show's portrayal of quarantine and testing was criticized for treating COVID-19 as something unique to the show's participants, rather than a universal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. It highlighted the [[impact_of_quarantine_on_celebrities | unique position of celebrities]] during the pandemic, who could "rent out an entire resort and hang out with a bunch of people in a bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, a privilege not afforded to most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Once all participants were "100% clear" and tested negative for COVID-19, they were officially cleared to proceed with filming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Narrative Integration of Pandemic
The initial episode prominently featured the contestants' experiences with testing and [[coping_with_boredom_while_staying_indoors | quarantining]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The show's editing even turned a contestant's dialogue about the pandemic into an over-dramatized sequence, making it seem like a struggle unique to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Contestants were also made to vlog their travels and excitement before meeting Claire, further integrating the pre-filming protocols into the storyline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

Despite these dramatic portrayals, the experience of getting tested for coronavirus was a requirement for participation, as one contestant noted, implying they wouldn't have been tested otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

[!WARNING|Criticism of Portrayal]
The show's dramatic presentation of pandemic-related challenges, such as the quarantine period, was criticized for seeming out of touch with the reality that "people are dying" during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The editing amplified these elements, making the contestants' experiences seem more arduous than they might have been in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

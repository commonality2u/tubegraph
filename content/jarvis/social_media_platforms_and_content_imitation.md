The social media platform TikTok is characterized by its short-form video content, which often sees users engaging in trends, memes, and challenges. While some content demonstrates creativity, a significant portion involves the imitation of existing formats, particularly in the realm of pranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## The Nature of TikTok Pranks

Pranks on TikTok are prevalent and often unavoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Traditionally, a prank is defined as a funny, harmless trick played on a friend, leading to shared laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, many TikTok pranks deviate from this definition, leading to questions about their genuine humor and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. While some argue that TikTok allows people to gain popularity without talent or creativity by imitating popular content, there is also nuanced and interesting content on the platform, excluding the pranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### "Get Rid of It" Pranks

A prominent example of imitative content involves "challenge" or "prank-challenge" videos, often featuring Australian creators Jackson O'Doherty and Kristen Han B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. These videos follow a predictable pattern: one friend instructs the other to "get rid of it," leading the second friend to reluctantly destroy or discard an item, often creating a public disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This often involves throwing food on the ground at places like Subway, causing inconvenience and embarrassment to service staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Despite the apparent surprise of the friend, the repetition of this phrase and the immediate compliance suggest a pre-arranged agreement rather than spontaneous pranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The reactions from the "pranked" individual, such as looking upset, are often staged, making the humor fall flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. These actions, which can involve property destruction or public disturbances, are performed for content creation, highlighting a focus on [[impact_of_online_fame_and_popularity_on_content_creation | online fame]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Such pranks, tagged with #funny and #friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, often raise questions about the true nature of the friendships portrayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

Many other creators imitate O'Doherty and Han B, often repeating the same "get rid of it" format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. One couple even used this prank style for a marriage proposal, which involved a fake police intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Michael Fallon TV and Dangerous "Pranks"

Another example of content imitation and questionable humor comes from creator Michael Fallon TV, who positions himself as a comedian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. His content, including a sketch titled "when you pick up a disabled hitchhiker," demonstrates a problematic sense of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. His "pranks" often involve destructive or dangerous acts under the guise of stopping unhealthy habits, such as running into traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a> or throwing someone's phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Fallon also participates in "dare or get slapped" videos, where he instantly performs an obnoxious public act (e.g., acting like a monkey on a table or stealing a bike) to avoid a slap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. These actions are performed without hesitation, highlighting a focus on [[the_use_of_extreme_content_for_social_media_engagement | extreme content]] for views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Other Imitative Prank Trends

Other popular, yet unoriginal, prank trends include:
*   **Raw Pasta Cracking Prank:** Users chew raw pasta to mimic bone cracking sounds, aiming to startle people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. This often involves disrupting people in public spaces like grocery stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **"Hit-or-Miss" Intercom Prank:** Playing loud, disruptive audio (like the "hit-or-miss" meme) over public intercoms, such as in Walmart, often causing discomfort or trouble for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This type of content often falls into [[the_use_of_extreme_content_for_social_media_engagement | extreme content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Feigning Injury/Danger:** Pranks involving spilling oil, faking choking, or pretending to harm others, often with destructive outcomes for property or potential harm to individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

## Motivation Behind Imitation

The primary motivation for engaging in these often unoriginal or harmful pranks appears to be the pursuit of [[impact_of_online_fame_and_popularity_on_content_creation | online fame]] and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Content creators are willing to take risks, despite the potential negative consequences (like being suspended from college for a harmless April Fool's prank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, for the chance of gaining followers and dopamine hits from viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This points to broader [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing strategies]] within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

These trends in content creation often demonstrate a lack of genuine humor and creativity, relying instead on shock value or repetitive formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The constant pursuit of engagement drives creators to continue producing similar content, even when it borders on harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a> or causes real-world disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

The [[overview_of_animated_story_channels|proliferation of fake animated story channels on YouTube]] has led to a critical examination of their practices and [[authenticity_of_animated_story_channels|authenticity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These channels often present highly [[clickbait_animation_channels|clickbait]] stories, claiming they are submitted by real children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Critique of "Actually Happened"

The channel "Actually Happened" claims to feature "completely truthful stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, it has been criticized for misleading viewers by presenting extremely [[clickbait_animation_channels|clickbait]] narratives that are allegedly submitted by kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Despite claiming that scripts must sound like they're told by a real teenager and be "as close to real life as possible without creating a sense that they're fake," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> many of their stories exhibit significant plot holes and illogical events.

### "I Faked Pregnancy to Get Good Grades"

This story, also titled "And Spoiled Yogurt Made Me the Most Popular Person in School," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> follows a 14-year-old named Nancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Key illogical elements include:
*   Nancy drinks clearly spoiled yogurt but doesn't notice anything off about the taste, smell, or consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   During a presentation, her friend Angela accidentally reads a random WebMD article about pregnancy because Nancy "blindly and without even thinking" included it in her presentation printouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   Despite Nancy only missing class due to sickness from the yogurt, the teacher "somehow quietly gave [her] an A" upon her return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   Nancy becomes the "most popular girl in school" and receives good grades from teachers because her friend read an article about morning sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   Her best friend Angela is convinced she is pregnant based solely on the accidental reading of the article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   A social worker gets involved, and Nancy lies about being pregnant, which leads to policemen visiting her home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   Despite defrauding the entire school and the involvement of social services and police, Nancy faces "no consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### "I Was Trapped in a House with Five Burglars"

This story went through multiple title changes, including "I Risked My Life to Save My Neighbors But It Didn't Help" and "I Thought I Was Smarter Than Burglars But Then I Got Trapped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The protagonist, 14-year-old Carla, decides to enter a burglarized house rather than call the police from outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   She tries to use a landline, which is dead because "the thieves cut the line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   She then finds a forgotten smartphone but decides not to call the police directly so "the thieves could not understand what I was saying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   Instead, she calls her mother and asks her to call the police in Spanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This is despite the Spanish word for police being "la policia," which is easily decipherable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   Carla's mother is "disappointed" with her for entering the house, which is portrayed as an appropriate response to the "ridiculous story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   The story concludes with Carla realizing that "a 14-year-old girl is not equipped to take on a gang of thieves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### "My Friends Think I'm Dead"

This video about a kid entering witness protection due to his dad's unnamed crime is criticized for its extreme lack of detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   The protagonist refuses to give a fake name, claiming he "can't" for safety reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   He states "plenty of details... will have to remain secret for safety reasons," yet shares the story with "millions of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   The story claims the family had to "fake their death" as part of witness protection, which is not accurate for the Witness Protection Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
*   A news story about their deaths in a car crash is presented, further indicating the story's fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## [[youtube_drama_and_animated_story_channels|YouTube Drama]] and Other Channels

Another channel, "My Story Animated," also faced [[critique_of_animated_story_channels|criticism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. They posted a "quiz show" video that showed animation clips from job applicants and asked viewers to guess if the person got hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This was seen as "shaming people who applied to work at their stupid company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> and was monetized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The video was quickly taken down, likely due to poor performance rather than "a conscience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## [[creating_parody_animation_channels|Creating Parody Animation Channels]]

In response to the perceived fakery, a parody animation channel titled "They Actually Animated My Story" was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This channel aimed to combat the original ones by joining them in style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The parody channel became quite successful, accumulating 25,000 subscribers and thousands of views with original stories, some playfully referencing existing works like "Gary Trotter" and "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. A key aspect of its success was the inability to differentiate between genuine and satirical comments, highlighting the irony inherent in the genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## The Clickbait Formula

These channels appear to follow a consistent formula for generating their [[clickbait_animation_channels|clickbait]] titles and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>:
1.  **First Person**: Titles must be in the first person, starting with "I" or "My," as the protagonist is typically a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
2.  **Subject**: The story either happens directly to the protagonist or involves a close family member (mom, dad, parents) or a crush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
3.  **Negative Event**: A "bad thing" must happen to create the [[clickbait_animation_channels|clickbait]], involving themes like death, crime, betrayal, or emotional manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Sometimes, these are combined, e.g., "My friend almost died after betraying me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

This formula is so consistent that it seems possible to teach an AI to generate believable titles for "Actually Happened" videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## AI-Generated Content

Using a statistical modeling technique called Markov chains, an algorithm was trained on existing "Actually Happened" video titles to generate new, non-existent titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This method analyzes word sequences to predict which word is likely to follow another, similar to text suggestions on a phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. For example, titles starting with "My" are often followed by "mom," "dad," or "parents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This process successfully produced titles such as "My dad became an Instagram star overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. A website, animatedstorytitles.com, was created to allow users to generate these titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, yielding examples like "I almost drowned and lost all my money in a card game," "My girlfriend is a grandma," and "My dad's last gift went missing and it killed their family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

An attempt was also made to use GPT-2, a sophisticated language model, trained on subtitle files from "Actually Happened" videos to generate full scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. While some interesting outputs were produced, such as "I have to work to survive after my dad lost all his friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a> and "My dad's fucking crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, the model struggled to generate coherent, full stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

## Conclusion: Dubiousness of Online Authenticity

After extensive analysis of these channels, the prevailing sentiment is one of fatigue and distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. While other channels like "Minute Videos" and "Share My Story" exist, the [[critique_of_fake_animated_stories|authenticity of animated story channels]] remains highly questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. The core takeaway is to "be dubious of anything that purports to be real on the Internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, as the internet allows for nearly anything to be said and believed, even if it is a fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

The described "Devious Licks" trend is explicitly discouraged. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> The situation has worsened since the video was filmed, with some schools cancelling events or returning to online learning due to the trend. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>


The "Devious Licks" trend is a [[TikTok pranks and trends|TikTok]] phenomenon involving the theft of items from schools, often escalating to vandalism. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> The term "lick" refers to something stolen, and "devious" implies the mischievous nature of the act. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>

## Origin and Evolution
The trend began on September 6th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> when a [[popular_tiktok_pranksters|TikToker]] posted a video pulling a hand sanitizer dispenser from a backpack with the text, "only a month into school and got this absolute devious lick." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> This original [[TikTok pranks and trends|TikTok]] and the associated account have since been deleted. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> The act was deemed "devious" for stealing soap during a pandemic. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>

The trend quickly escalated due to the "clout" or public recognition gained from posting stolen items. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> Participants typically film themselves opening a Jansport backpack and revealing the stolen item. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>

## Impact and Responses

### Student Impact
Many students find the trend funny, but others view it as an inconvenience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a> For example, the widespread theft of soap dispensers leaves students unable to wash their hands. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a> Incidents such as attempted urinal theft led to bathroom closures and flooding. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>

### Teacher Perspectives
Teachers express concern over the trend's impact on already underfunded public schools. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a> Some teachers are torn, understanding the desire to "stick it to the administration" but needing to protect personal investments (like books bought with their own money) and ensure students can wash their hands. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>

One teacher noted the sadness of an underfunded math class having "no devious licks to hit" because there was nothing left to steal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>

### School Responses
Schools have responded by:
*   Closing damaged bathrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
*   Running out of soap dispensers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
*   Issuing school-wide emails threatening legal and school action. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a> Many of these emails incorrectly spell "[[TikTok pranks and trends|TikTok]]" as "Tick Tok." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>
*   Implementing strict bathroom access rules, such as signing in and out, or locking bathrooms entirely. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>
*   Setting up anonymous tip lines to encourage students to report vandals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>
*   Making announcements, like a principal's address emphasizing school spirit and respect, which is generally not seen as an effective deterrent for students engaged in the trend. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>

The financial burden of repairing damages from the trend exacerbates the existing problem of underfunded public schools, potentially diverting more resources away from teachers and students. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>

## Social Commentary
The "Devious Licks" trend highlights a unique moment in internet history where common school pranks are amplified and broadcast on social media for "clout." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a> While some find humor in the brazenness of the acts, the trend also reveals a darker side as participants take it too far, leading to actual harm and consequences for schools and students. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>

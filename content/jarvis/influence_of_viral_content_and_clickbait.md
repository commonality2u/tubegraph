Viral content, particularly that produced by content farms like Blossom, significantly [[influence_of_sensational_content_on_viewer_engagement | influences viewer engagement]] and spreads information rapidly, often without regard for accuracy. These entities prioritize generating clicks and views over providing factual or useful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Blossom as a Content Farm

Blossom is identified as a "content farm" that creates "pointless content" to "harvest clicks for views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. It is compared to other similar channels like "5 Minute Crafts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Content Strategy and Virality
Blossom's content often features absurd "life hacks" or claims, such as:
*   Not cleaning black tar off a strainer before putting it back in a drawer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Folding laundry and suddenly deciding to turn oneself into a "hoodie crab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Claiming that peanut butter and hot coal can be turned into diamonds overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

A viral video from Blossom titled "Is your food fake or real? Find out with these 16 easy tests at home!" achieved 100 million views on Facebook alone within a couple of days and also went viral on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This video, which was reportedly the most viewed video on Facebook in 2018, demonstrates the power of its sensational claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The business model of these content farms dictates that "if something works... it's going to be repeated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. They primarily "just want clicks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### Dissemination of Misinformation
Blossom's content often introduces problems that "no one in modern society has to worry about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The videos lack context and sources for their claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Examples of their misleading "tests" include:

*   **Processed Cheese:** Claiming processed cheese doesn't melt well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, despite melting being one of its primary strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The demonstration involves holding cheese to a fire, which causes it to turn black like most things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Supplements:** Suggesting that if supplements melt in an oven, they are "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, a statement described as "completely unsubstantiated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Rice:** Claiming that rice is mixed with plastic because it's too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The test for this "conspiracy" is simply heating the rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, an unavoidable part of cooking rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The video shows plastic rice turning transparent instead of melting when heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Baby Food:** Suggesting baby food contains "ground up rocks" because a magnet test shows magnetic properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This ignores that iron, a magnetic mineral, is a common and necessary ingredient in baby food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Milk:** Stating that milk will turn blue if seaweed is added, unless it is "pure milk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. The concept of "pure milk" is vague, as most milk is processed (e.g., pasteurized) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Coffee:** Claiming that "pure coffee sinks" while "coffee with additives floats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. In reality, fresh coffee floats, and stale coffee sinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Salt:** Suggesting that salt mixed with chalk will not immediately dissolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This is misleading, as pouring salt into water will naturally result in some undissolved particles if the volume of salt exceeds its solubility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

The "facts" presented in these videos are "completely fake or... extremely misleading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. The "fake green peas" story, for example, is loosely based on a single event that occurred in China nine years prior, making the claim inaccurate in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This is described as a "smokescreen" where they superficially advocate for consumer awareness about food, but their actions suggest they care more about clicks than providing context or sourcing claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Impact of Algorithms on Viewer Perception

The influence of social media algorithms is highlighted through the "Facebook algorithm," which can lead users to believe information that is false due to its perceived "bulletproof track record" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This trust can lead to the acceptance of conspiracy theories, such as 9/11 being an inside job or Jay-Z and Beyonc√© being "lizard people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Monetization and Advertising
Blossom generates revenue through "grand partnerships" due to its large following, such as a 51 million-follower Facebook page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. They produce ads for other brands, including teeth whitening products and "health apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. These health app commercials often feature sensationalized scenarios, like a man experiencing chest pain on a date, then using the app to self-diagnose and find potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This suggests a broader pattern of using alarmist or misleading content to drive engagement and sales, blurring the lines between informational content and advertising.

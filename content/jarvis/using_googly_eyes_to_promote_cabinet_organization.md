This article details a life hack proposed by an audience member to address the common problem of leaving kitchen cabinets open. The hack was designed to create an incentive for people to close cabinets by making the open cabinets appear "creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.

## The Problem: Open Kitchen Cabinets

The inspiration for this hack came from Alexis, a co-host on the Stereo app, whose mother frequently leaves kitchen cabinets open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. The creator, living at his mom's house, described his personal method of dealing with open cabinets: making eye contact with his mother and slowly closing the cabinet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This hack aimed to automate that "meaningful eye contact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## The Googly Eye Life Hack

The proposed solution involves attaching large googly eyes to the inside of cabinet doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>. The theory behind the hack is that if the googly eyes are staring back at you when the cabinet is open, you will feel "creeped out" and want to close the cabinet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.

## Implementation and Outcome

To test the hack, giant googly eyes were purchased from Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. After applying the googly eyes to the kitchen cabinets, the creator observed that the appearance was "a little creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. However, despite the intended effect, at least one cabinet was still left open, indicating the hack had limited success in consistently prompting cabinet closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The digital landscape, particularly YouTube, is rife with "top 10 channels" or "facts channels" that prioritize sensationalism over factual accuracy, significantly impacting content quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. These channels, often described as the "YouTube equivalent of tabloids," cover trending topics, celebrity gossip, and even conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This phenomenon highlights the [[influence_of_viral_content_and_clickbait | influence of viral content and clickbait]] on online media.

## The Rise of Middle-Aged Content Farms

These channels are often referred to as "middle-aged [[impact_of_content_farms_on_youtube_and_digital_media | content farms]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. They continue to produce "awful content as quickly as possible" even when their initial algorithmic strategies become ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Many of these channels appear "exactly the same" in their presentation and content approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## Case Study: The Richest

"The Richest" channel is presented as a prime example of "nothing content" that is "technically amazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Despite its self-description as a channel for "unbelievable but amazing facts about the most interesting people on earth" (assumed to be rich people), its content frequently deviates from this premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

For instance, out of 50 recent videos, only five were about rich people, an equal number to those about Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

### Disconnect Between Title and Content

The channel employs a technique known as "Kalika by," which refers to the complete disconnect between the video's content and its title or thumbnail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. It appears as if the creators of the titles and thumbnails have not seen the video, and the video creators are unaware of the intended topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This results in [[the_impact_of_clickbait_and_misleading_thumbnails | clickbait]] that is "not even compelling" but simply "inaccurate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

#### Examples of Misleading Content:

*   **"15 weird rules the NBA forces on players"**: This video, featuring a thumbnail of a man with one shaved armpit, surprisingly discusses the basic rules of basketball, such as the 10-second free-throw cap or not being able to kick the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   **"11 things Grams you can't live without" (Gordon Ramsay)**: Despite the title, the video discusses "SuperDuper insanely expensive things that this potty-mouth owns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:03]</a>. The list is dominated by cars, with Ramsay's family surprisingly low on the list at number five, and his watch at number one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. The video also makes unsubstantiated claims, such as Gordon Ramsay owning a Flintstone mobile or a car from *The Simpsons*, which are "cartoons" and not real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
    *   The narration in these videos is often described as flat and humorless, with strange "meta world-building" aspects, like the narrator accidentally calling Gordon Ramsay "Jamie Oliver" and blaming a "non-existent stock photo intern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

## Widespread Factual Inaccuracies and Fabricated Stories

A significant [[criticism_of_lowquality_content_on_youtube_channels | criticism of low-quality content on YouTube channels]] is their blatant disregard for facts. Lying for [[clickbait_animation_channels | clickbait]] on YouTube is noted as an "ancient tradition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>. Channels routinely lie about "hyper specific stuff that is easily disproven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.

### Examples of Fabricated "Facts":

*   **FBI Cold Cases**: Videos claim the FBI "finally solves the cold case of DB Cooper," "finally solves the Jimmy Hoffa cold case," and "finally confirm existence of Bigfoot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. These are presented as "news" that is also "news to the FBI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>.
*   **Ariana Grande's Rules**: A video titled "ten strict rules ariana grande must follow on tour" discusses the singer's preferred side for photos rather than actual tour rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.
*   **Conspiracies and Paranormal**:
    *   "Did scientists confirm aliens from Antarctica?" This is dismissed as nonsensical because if aliens were from Antarctica, they would be "earthlings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>.
    *   "Pilot confirmed strange time travel over Bermuda": This video sensationalizes the Bermuda Triangle, referencing a pilot who supposedly landed 30 minutes early 50 years ago, with the only "reasonable explanation" being time travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>. The article notes there's "no evidence that this happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.
*   **Titanic**: A video titled "new evidence finally reveals the real reason the Titanic sank" aims to dispute the widely accepted cause of the sinking (an iceberg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[22:45:00]</a>. The video humorously (within the host's commentary) concludes that the real reason the Titanic sank was "Jarvis Johnson" (the host) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>.

## Corporate Ownership and Content Recycling

Many of these channels, including "The Richest," "Screen Rant," "TheTalko," "TheThings," and "Moms.com," are owned by the Canadian company Valnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. This corporate structure leads to content recycling; similar video formats are used across different channels, with only slight shifts in subject matter to target different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>. For example, "TheThings" and "The Bender" channels both have videos titled "strict rules the cast of stranger things must follow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.

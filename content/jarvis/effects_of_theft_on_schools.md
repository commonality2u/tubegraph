The "Devious Licks" trend, originating on TikTok, involves students stealing or vandalizing items from their schools and posting videos of their actions online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This phenomenon rapidly escalated into a widespread epidemic, leading to significant [[responses_from_schools_and_teachers_to_the_trend | consequences for schools]] and students alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Origin and Nature of the Trend

The trend began on September 6th, when a TikTok user posted a video showing a hand sanitizer dispenser being pulled from a backpack, captioned as an "absolute devious lick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. The term "lick" refers to something stolen, and "devious" implies a mischievous act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The original TikTok was deleted, but it set the stage for thousands of similar videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

The initial act of stealing a hand sanitizer dispenser during a pandemic was considered "devious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Subsequent videos typically feature students excitedly opening backpacks to reveal stolen items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

The trend is speculated to be a way for students to vent frustration after prolonged periods of distance learning, social isolation, and anxieties about global issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Participants often brag about their petty theft publicly, treating it as if they are "criminal masterminds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## Escalation of Theft and Vandalism

What started with minor items quickly escalated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>:
*   **Common Items** – Soap dispensers, bathroom mirrors, Expo markers, safety scissors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   **High-Value Items** – Projectors, smart boards, microscopes, Chromebooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure Damage** – Stealing bathroom stall doors, urinals (leading to flooding), sinks, exit signs, clocks, and even street lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Items** – Students have reported shoes being stolen from restrooms, and teachers' personal items like framed family photos or car emblems being taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

The trend progressed from simple theft to outright vandalism, causing significant damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. Some videos even showed items students *intended* to steal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

## Impact on Schools

The "Devious Licks" trend has had severe repercussions for schools:

*   **Financial Strain** – Schools are forced to spend "valuable resources, time, and money" on repairing damages and replacing stolen items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. This is particularly problematic for [[public_school_underfunding | publicly underfunded schools]], where budgets are already tight and teachers often use their own money for classroom supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. The cost of repairs can further deplete budgets, potentially impacting resources available to students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.
*   **Operational Disruptions** – Some schools have canceled homecomings and other events due to the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Entire bathrooms have been closed because soap dispensers, mirrors, or sinks were stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. In some cases, schools have resorted to online learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Hygiene and Safety Issues** – The widespread theft of soap dispensers and other bathroom fixtures creates unsanitary conditions, making it difficult for students to wash their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. Stealing signs like "high voltage" signs also poses safety hazards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Security Measures** – Schools have implemented measures like signing in and out of bathrooms, locking bathrooms, or installing anonymous tip lines to catch perpetrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>. Teachers have also resorted to keeping cameras on in their classrooms to protect their own purchased materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.
*   **Loss of Trust and School Spirit** – The trend fosters an environment of disrespect and mistrust within the school community. Principals have tried to appeal to "school spirit" to encourage students to stop the behavior, but this argument often fails to resonate with students more interested in internet "clout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>.

## Responses and Student Sentiment

Student reactions to the trend are varied; many find it funny, while others consider it a major inconvenience, especially when basic amenities like soap or accessible bathrooms are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

School administrations have sent out numerous school-wide emails threatening legal action and school disciplinary action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. Many of these official communications humorously misspell "TikTok" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. School principals have even addressed the issue during morning announcements, emphasizing respect and community, though such appeals often fall flat with students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

Despite the disruption and damage, the trend is viewed as a "weird little moment in internet history," with expectations that it will eventually run its course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

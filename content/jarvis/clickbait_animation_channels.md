[[overview_of_animated_story_channels | Clickbait animation channels]] on YouTube are characterized by their "overdramatic and probably fake stories submitted by kids," presented through animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These channels are often described as "content farms" due to their high volume of low-quality content designed primarily for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Proliferation and Characteristics

One prominent example, My Story Animated, describes itself as "a digital platform that provides people with the opportunity to share their most interesting and life-changing stories with the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. However, it is noted as being highly similar to another channel, Actually Happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Actually Happened, in turn, is considered a copy of Storybooth, a "legitimate channel that actually works with kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This makes My Story Animated a "copy of a copy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, characterized by "absurd clickbait and really lazy production quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Since its launch three months prior to observation, My Story Animated had gained over 500,000 subscribers with viral titles such as "I was obsessed with our neighbors Ferrari so I stole it" and "I'm the richest girl in school and it's embarrassing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Lack of Authenticity

A key criticism is the [[authenticity_of_animated_story_channels | authenticity of animated story channels]]. While channels like Actually Happened claim to animate stories submitted by kids, it is "more likely that they're just... making it all up or stealing it from Reddit verbatim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. For instance, the story "I broke up with my girlfriend because of potatoes" was found to be oddly specific and previously posted on Reddit's "Today I Fucked Up" subreddit three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Further evidence of direct copying is that My Story Animated's subscribe link on their about page initially linked to Actually Happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Production and Ownership

My Story Animated demonstrates even lower [[critique_of_animated_story_channels | production quality]] than Actually Happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. While Actually Happened is linked to the creators of 5-Minute Crafts, My Story Animated is an "independent operation run by an Israeli app developer called Zboyd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Many of their stories feature "extremely unrelatable people that definitely don't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Story Examples and Analysis

### "I was too innocent when I got into the top secret vampire society"

This story features a girl named Sarah obsessed with vampires due to consuming media like Twilight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. She attempts to join a vampire society based on traits like being "super pale" and having "slightly pointy teeth," and being "properly allergic to garlic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. She eventually finds a "top-secret" group online via a "bat forum" and gains entry with a password, only to discover it's a cult, not real vampires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The story culminates with her parents and police rescuing her from being trapped in a coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The inclusion of a police statement summary at the end, asserting it's a true story, is seen as an absurd attempt to lend credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### "I found a thief in my room and I outsmarted him"

Many videos open with a message like a police report summary, similar to a "Law & Order" episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. In this story, the protagonist "outsmarted" a thief by remembering to call the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The police report summary states the thief was not locked up because he was 16, it was his first offense, and he had no prior criminal record, information reportedly obtained from "Claire parents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### "I told the truth to the wrong person and it ruined my life"

This story features Sheila, who has a habit of "talking too much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Examples include insulting a birthday girl's hat and almost revealing her family's house key location to a mailman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Her major transgression is creating an anonymous Instagram account, photoshopping herself into pictures with a crush, blurring her face, and using "sweet captions" to cause his breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. She proudly confesses this to a new friend, who turns out to be a "double agent" and exposes her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The story concludes with her having to switch schools to avoid consequences, with the "moral" being that "there is a difference between being truthful and being tactless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

### "I'm the richest person in my school and it's embarrassing"

Jessica, the protagonist, finds her extreme wealth embarrassing. Her father used to drop her off at school in a helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. On her first day at a new school, she tries to take the bus but discovers it doesn't service her house because the school assumed it was a "fancy hotel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Word of her wealth spreads quickly, supposedly due to her "Dolce & Gabbana backpack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, and she is mocked by "Little Miss rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. She resolves the bullying by putting up a poster on the noticeboard stating that despite her wealth, she is "still a normal kid like them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>, leading the bullies to apologize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## The Content Farm Model

The proliferation of these channels highlights a market where companies "find a market... and they just like pump out a ton of like low quality content and make money because they're able to advertise it to people who like don't know any better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This business model represents the "birth of a content farm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Creating Parody

To demonstrate the ease of creating such content and [[critique_of_animated_story_channels | critique of animated story channels]], a parody animation channel, "They Actually Animated My Story," was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. This channel features a character named Jake, a "relatable American teenager who totally exists" and is "disgustingly rich" and "extremely famous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Another parody story, "Gary who finds out that he's a wizard on his 11th birthday," was commissioned for approximately $100, illustrating the low cost and high profit margins for these content farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

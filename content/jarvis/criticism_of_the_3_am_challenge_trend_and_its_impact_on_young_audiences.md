YouTube's content ecosystem includes a sub-genre specifically designed to "creep kids out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This includes videos centered around the "3 a.m. Challenge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, which often involve supposedly haunted characters like Barney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The primary target audience for this content appears to be preteens, or "kids in the Middle Ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, who often bypass YouTube's age restrictions by lying about their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Exploitation of Young Audiences
Creators are perceived as attempting to "squeeze the ad dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> out of this demographic. This pursuit of revenue can lead to the production of questionable content.

### JayStation as a Case Study
JayStation is identified as a significant "offender" in this trend, with a brand built around "creeping out kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. His channel features a variety of "upsetting content" involving characters like Freddy Krueger, Mike Myers, and Cookie Monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Notably, he produced a video claiming to communicate with the spirit of Mac Miller, which is described as "disrespectful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The broader 3 a.m. challenge trend, including JayStation's involvement, has been critiqued by other creators such as Deanna Gonzales and Cody Cove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## The "Gay Potion" Trend
A more recent and concerning trend involves videos pretending to order magic potions, specifically a "gay potion," from the dark web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Homophobic and Problematic Content
These "gay potion" videos are categorized as "mega homophobic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, as their premise relies on the idea that "being gay is like spooky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The humor is derived from "systemic homophobia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> and "one-dimensional view of what it means to be a guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Specific problematic elements include:
*   Grossly stereotypical gay impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   Portrayals of non-consensual touching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   Use of stereotypes about women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   The creators frequently emphasize their straightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   A video even features Kermit the Frog being forced to drink the "gay potion" and engage in a sensual kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   Another video combines "baby and gay potion" with no understanding of what a "gay baby" would entail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

### Audience Reaction and Content Intent
Comments on these videos primarily express disgust from adults and concern from children, including questions about the realism of the content and homophobia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. While creators may claim the videos are "all in good fun," it is criticized as being at the "expense of a marginalized group" and a "clear money grab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

## Broader Implications
This type of content is viewed as a mixture of "clout chasing with ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>, which, when amplified by the internet, can cause "real pain for people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. There is a call for media with positive and realistic depictions of LGBTQ+ people to help kids and adults feel less alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, rather than content that sensationalizes or stereotypes identities for views.

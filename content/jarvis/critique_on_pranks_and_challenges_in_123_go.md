123 Go is a YouTube channel primarily focused on pranks, challenges, "fun times with your friends," and life hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Since a previous review, the channel has doubled in size and launched several new channels, including "123 Go Challenge" and "123 Go Play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Despite its growth, the content is often described as "weird" and difficult to comprehend, resembling a "European dystopia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Viewers have found watching the videos "harrowing" and "traumatizing and miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Unrealistic and Nonsensical Content

The channel's content often features scenarios and solutions that are detached from reality.

### Unrealistic Scenarios
*   Videos often present "things only 1% of people can do" challenges that appear absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   One video, "Funny ideas to recycle old toys," begins with a character explicitly trying to steal candy from a friend, despite the video's supposed theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The suggested "hack" involves cutting open a teddy bear to hide a jar of candy, which deviates from the idea of recycling toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   The segments frequently start with an "issue" that is then resolved in an overly complicated or nonsensical way, such as needing instructions for "how to use a jar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### [[Critique of unrealistic and staged life hacks | Unrealistic Life Hacks]]
*   "Genius lazy cleaning hacks" are presented, but the initial "hack" shows characters intentionally making a mess by eating sunflower seeds and dropping them on the floor for a Roomba to clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This is criticized for creating trash rather than genuinely cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   A "hack" to clean a shower head with vinegar suggests leaving a bag of vinegar on it for five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, despite the character being in a rush to meet someone in 20 minutes, making the solution impractical within the video's own timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   A "lazy cleaning hack" for dishes involves gluing sponges to the fingers of a rubber glove, which is stated to make the sponge "less effective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   Another cleaning hack involves putting sticky goo on a keyboard to pick up crumbs, which is criticized as simply making slime and potentially damaging a laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## [[The Ethics of Staging Prank Videos | Prank Content and Its Impact]]
The channel frequently features "best pranks and funny tricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. However, the nature of these pranks raises questions:
*   The pranks are often presented as being played on friends or family who the prankster supposedly "hate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   Examples include putting an unpeeled banana in someone's mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a> or rigging toilet paper with hot glue to prevent it from unrolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.
*   These pranks are seen as "mean" and impractical, with characters asking for basic courtesies instead of pranks, such as "kindly ask them not to" steal food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   The "pranks" often show characters reacting in exaggerated distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, and the overall impression is that these are staged interactions rather than genuine reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

## Production and Narrative Style
*   The scripts of 123 Go videos are noted for their similarity, often featuring formulaic phrases like "nothing like a [noun] to cheer a girl up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   Videos frequently use reversed shots, speculated to be a tactic to upload content to multiple channels without YouTube's detection of duplicate videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.
*   The channel's aesthetic and slogans ("stay happy," "there is always a rainbow after the rain") are described as "dystopian aphorisms," implying a manufactured positivity in a bleak setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   The content often depicts "full-grown adults that act like 11 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, with inanimate objects sometimes having more personality than the characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

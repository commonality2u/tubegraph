Technological innovation often pushes the boundaries of what's possible, but it also highlights the critical need for ethical considerations. The case of Ethan Kaiser, described as a "Titan of toxic tech," provides a compelling example of how advanced technical skills can be misapplied in ways that raise significant ethical concerns [00:00:26]. As a software engineer and entrepreneur, Kaiser has gained viral attention for creating "hacks" for social media and dating apps, many of which are criticized for being invasive and manipulative [00:00:28], [00:00:34].

## Case Studies in Unethical Tech Use

### Relationship Monitoring Through WiFi

One of Kaiser's reported "hacks" involves using a partner's Wi-Fi password to gain access to their router. This allows him to check which devices have connected to the network, enabling remote monitoring of their presence at home or the presence of other devices [00:00:48], [00:01:00]. This practice is explicitly condemned as "abusive behavior," "stalking," and a "betrayal of trust and [[invasive_technology_and_privacy_concerns | privacy]]" [00:01:21], [00:02:18]. The speaker emphasizes that using technology does not make such actions less [[invasive_technology_and_privacy_concerns | invasive]] or morally acceptable than physically searching someone's phone [00:02:11], [00:02:22].

### The Rebound App: Capitalizing on Vulnerability

Kaiser developed an app called "Rebound," designed to track relationships on Instagram. The app monitors whether individuals follow or unfollow each other, sending push notifications when a couple breaks up [00:07:09], [00:07:48]. Alarmingly, Kaiser claims to then use this information to "slide into their DMs" minutes after a breakup, with a reported 30% response rate [00:08:04], [00:08:06], [00:08:08]. This approach is criticized for potentially exploiting vulnerable individuals and for using tech to intrude on personal relationships under the guise of data collection [00:08:16], [00:11:11]. The underlying aim appears to be to disprove the notion of "soulmates" or lasting relationships based on data, which the speaker finds "disgusting" [00:09:18], [00:10:00].

### Faking Fame with a "Clout" App

Another creation is an app that simulates an Instagram Live stream, displaying thousands of fake viewers and a pre-programmed chat [00:11:36], [00:13:07]. Kaiser uses this app to appear famous in real-life settings, such as clubs or parties, to gain special treatment or entry [00:12:22], [00:16:05]. This deception is called out as "lying about your identity" [00:12:01] and a "sad thing to do" [00:14:36]. The programmed chat messages, such as "Guess who my favorite creator is?" and "Have you ever heard of Ethan Kaiser?", are described as painting a "saddest picture of all time" [00:13:31]. The ethical issue here revolves around intentional misrepresentation for personal gain, creating a false reality for others.

### AI for Dating: Impersonation and Deception

Perhaps the most ethically problematic "hack" involves dating apps. Kaiser "reverse engineered" major dating apps to store nearly 50,000 user profiles in a database, including full names and phone numbers, which the speaker had to blur for privacy [00:18:19], [00:18:21], [00:18:29]. He then programmed an AI to swipe right on all of them, resulting in 5,000 matches [00:19:04]. To interact with these matches, he built an AI based on the personalities of serial killer Patrick Bateman (from *American Psycho*) and James Bond [00:19:21], [00:19:24], [00:19:25]. The AI communicates using movie quotes, such as "Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want, just say it, I can get us in anywhere," which are often lines spoken by Bateman before committing violent acts [00:20:01], [00:20:14].

This practice is condemned as "ethically wrong" because the individuals on the dating app are unaware they are interacting with an AI, not a human, and certainly not an AI designed to mimic a serial killer [00:23:01], [00:20:18]. It represents a profound betrayal of trust and a complete disregard for the consent of the other party [00:23:06].

## Broader Ethical Implications

The speaker consistently returns to the core ethical problem: "Just because you can, doesn't mean you should" [00:22:56]. While some of Kaiser's "hacks" may seem impressive from a technical standpoint, their implementation crosses significant ethical lines.

The fact that many people are "into it" despite the dubious nature of these "hacks" is attributed to the inherent difficulties of dating and the appeal of quick solutions [00:23:33], [00:23:51]. However, the speaker stresses that these actions are "creepy" [00:24:44], "toxic" [00:24:47], and "morally gray at best" [00:25:02]. The core issue lies in the deliberate deception and lack of consent, which undermines trust and can cause emotional harm to unsuspecting individuals.

The example of Ethan Kaiser underscores the [[ethics_of_using_technology_for_social_manipulation | ethics of using technology for social manipulation]]. It serves as a stark reminder that innovation must be tempered with responsibility and a strong adherence to ethical principles, especially concerning privacy, consent, and honest human interaction.

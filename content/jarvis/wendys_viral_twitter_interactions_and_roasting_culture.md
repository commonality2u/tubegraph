Fast-food brands on Twitter have developed strange habits to appear "hip and with-it" and appeal to a younger audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. While sometimes humorous, these interactions can also be peculiar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Wendy's is a prominent example, having pioneered the strategy of roasting individuals and competitors on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Wendy's on Twitter

Wendy's gained significant attention when a tweet went viral, leading to widespread imitation by other brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. The initial viral exchange involved Wendy's tweeting, "our beef is way too cool to ever be frozen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. When a user challenged this by stating, "Your beef is frozen and we all know it," Wendy's responded by referencing their "fresh never frozen" slogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. The interaction escalated, with Wendy's questioning where the user stores cold non-frozen items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, eventually concluding the argument by stating, "You don't have to bring them into this just because you forgot refrigerators existed for a second there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

Following this, Wendy's began "roasting fans and competitors alike," such as replying to a user asking for the nearest McDonald's with a sarcastic "nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This approach garnered significant media attention, with headlines like "Wendy's roasting people on Twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a> and "Wendy's social media team smells blood pounces on wounded wildebeest McDonald's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a> highlighting their aggressive, humorous style.

### The Problematic Side of Corporate Roasting

While these roasts are often perceived as funny in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, a concern arises when the public collectively celebrates a multi-million dollar corporation "dunking on a regular ass person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Many of the tweets Wendy's responds to end up deleted, which can make the brand appear to be "harassing people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. For instance, a deleted tweet prompted Wendy's to respond, "Oh is your waifu not giving you enough attention?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

By 2018, people were actively "begging to be roasted by Wendy's," a phenomenon described as something out of "1984 or 2018 because honestly nothing matters anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

## Wendy's Evolution into Meme Status

Wendy's has largely achieved [[rise_of_meme_culture_among_fastfood_brands | meme status]] on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. They actively cater to this status by:
*   Tweeting references to popular memes, such as "a surgery on a grape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   Streaming Fortnite on Twitch, where they symbolically destroyed all freezers in the game to reinforce their "no frozen beef" slogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   Releasing a mixtape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

This persona positions Wendy's as a "quirky friend" putting out good content, which the audience rewards with attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. However, this raises the question of whether this behavior is a calculated strategy by a large corporation to increase sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## The Widespread Adoption of Brand Twitter [[strategies_of_fastfood_brands_on_twitter | Strategies]]

Following Wendy's success, this [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing strategy]] has become widespread and, at times, "dystopian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

### Other Brands Joining the Trend

*   **Burger King:** Their Twitter also features "absolutely destroying their customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. For example, when a user complained about missing cheese, Burger King retorted, "pro tip if you want cheese on your whopper use your words of the counters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. They also awkwardly use pop culture references like Kardashian memes incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
*   **Inter-Brand Dynamics:** Brands like Netflix often appear in the replies of other brand tweets, creating an illusion of camaraderie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This sometimes escalates into manufactured "beefs" between brands, such as a "rap battle" between Wendy's and Wingstop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Burger King also has a "one-sided beef with McDonald's where McDonald's has never responded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>, including a campaign offering free Whoppers if ordered at a McDonald's using their app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   **Products as Personalities:** Even non-fast-food products adopt these [[brands_using_social_media_for_relatable_content | relatable identities]].
    *   **Pop-Tarts:** Their account tweets in the first person, engaging in "relationship problems" humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
    *   **Hot Pockets:** Their Twitter content is described as "definitely written by someone who's high," aligning with a "stoner cousin" identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.
    *   **MoonPies:** This century-old snack brand has become a "certified memer," engaging in self-deprecating humor and even flirty exchanges with Wendy's, which culminated in Wendy's creating a "Baconator out of moon pies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. MoonPies also [[social_media_outrage_culture_and_its_monetization | roast their fans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

### The Self-Aware Anti-Brand: Steak-umm

A peculiar example of this trend is the frozen beef snack brand Steak-umm. Despite being an obscure product, their Twitter account has gained a significant following for its "most woke Twitter" presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. Steak-umm is uniquely "self-aware about brand Twitter," often engaging in meta-commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. For instance, in response to Wendy's "national roast day," Steak-umm challenged them to roast their "frozen beef sheets," calling them "corporate cowards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Their tweets rarely focus on the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a> and often critique the very nature of corporate social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

> [11:30:00] Brand posts out-of-touch content critics stupid brand this meme is ancient
> [11:34:00] brand post trending content critics stupid brand how do you do fellow kids
> [11:38:00] brand post-ironic self-aware content critics stupid brands stop being aware and destroying the internet

Steak-umm's self-awareness has even led to them being included in an "AV Club worst of 2018 list" due to their meta approach, yet their fans defended them fiercely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.

## The "Why" Behind the Trend

The phenomenon of young people flocking to brands on social media for "love, guidance, and attention" is attributed to societal factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. This generation is described as:
*   Isolated from real communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.
*   Working service jobs they dislike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.
*   Burdened by student debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.
*   Growing up with the dawn of internet culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
*   Feeling more alone and insecure despite full access to information and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

As a result, they turn to memes, absurdist humor, and even "frozen meat companies on Twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. This strategy works; Wendy's has grown its Twitter following to almost 3 million, and business appears to be booming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

### Harms and Benefits of Relatable Branding

While entertaining ads can be a positive aspect of this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>, there's a potential for harm. Companies could engage in "shady" practices and hide behind a "cartoon mascot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. For example, while Wendy's boasts "fresh never frozen beef," critics point out issues like "slave forever potatoes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

However, this environment also enables creators to support their careers through brand partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. Despite pessimistic views that this advertising "poisons our culture," advertising is deeply integrated into society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>. Ultimately, brand tweets are considered among the least of modern worries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

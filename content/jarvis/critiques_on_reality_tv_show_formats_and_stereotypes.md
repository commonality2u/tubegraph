The reality television series *America's Most Smartest Model*, which aired for a single season on VH1, is heavily critiqued for its flawed format and perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. The show's premise attempts to answer the question, "can hot hot sexy model also have brain?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> by asking 16 models to be both beautiful and smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This premise itself is deemed "stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, suggesting an inherent bias against the intelligence of models.

## Flawed Premises and Challenges

The show's core concept, described as *America's Next Top Model* meets *Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, features "strange challenges" that combine modeling with trivia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Examples include a spelling bee with foreign fashion brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> or a runway walk requiring contestants to list types of trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These challenges are criticized for not genuinely testing intelligence, but rather being used for body shaming and intelligence shaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

It is highlighted that "knowledge of random trivia has no bearing on your intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, undermining the show's purported goal of finding a "smart" model. Furthermore, some challenges are unfairly difficult for non-American contestants, with no effort made to adjust or balance the games, such as questions about American bicentennial history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## Host Behavior and Stereotypes

The show's hosts, Mary Alice Stevenson (for beauty) and Ben Stein (for brains) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, are central to the critiques. Ben Stein, despite his accolades as a Yale Law School valedictorian and bestselling author <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, is characterized as a "slimy little troll" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. His role primarily involves "constantly fawning over the female contestants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, engaging in a "creepy old guy bit" that is described as "nasty" and "gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

The show is broadly defined by its meanness and overuse of stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, with judges acting "mean" and "evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## [[negative_portrayal_of_models_and_contestants_in_reality_television | Negative Portrayal of Models and Contestants]]

The show's [[reality_tv_show_editing_and_narrative | editing and narrative]] choices contribute significantly to [[dramatization_and_editing_in_reality_tv | the negative portrayal of models and contestants]]:

*   **Cocky Stereotype**: Contestants' interviews are edited to make them appear "extremely cocky," aligning with a common stereotype about models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. One contestant's statement about coming from money and belittling the $100,000 prize is an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Foreign Accents and Backgrounds**: An Argentinian model, Gaston, is mocked for not understanding "weird English words" like "nincompoop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Another, Andre, is presented as a "Russian bad boy" who introduces himself as being from the "Soviet Union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **ADHD Stereotype**: A contestant with ADHD is consistently edited to appear "off the walls," "unable to stop talking," and "completely unaware of his surroundings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, which is called "unfair," "dumb," and "ableist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Objectification and Body Shaming**: The show explicitly asks for contestants' height in addition to academic credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, reinforcing [[the_concept_of_exploitation_and_reality_tv | objectification]]. Judges tell contestants they "might need to lose some weight" or "slim down a bit," even for individuals with "perfectly normal and beautiful" bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This is seen as perpetuating "unrealistic beauty standards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **"Porn Star" Label**: Mandy Lynn, a lingerie and former Playboy model, is repeatedly and unfairly labeled a "porn star" by other contestants and the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This is viewed as a "mean" attempt to "chop her down based on the way that she presents herself and looks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, despite her deserving respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## [[discussion_on_toxic_dynamics_and_bullying_in_reality_tv | Toxic Dynamics and Bullying]]

The show fosters an environment of intense cattiness and a complete lack of camaraderie or community among contestants, who are "at each other's neck at all times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This is contrasted with other reality dating shows like [[critique_of_the_bachelor_as_a_television_show | *The Bachelor*]], where contestants still build relationships despite competing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

A male contestant, Gaston, makes "inappropriate sexual comments towards every woman in the house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. While his actions are condemned as sucky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, the show's producers are criticized for playing into this behavior, casting him, and continually showcasing these clips, implying a cynical attempt to generate "funny" content from his misogyny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## [[the_concept_of_exploitation_and_reality_tv | Exploitative Formats]]

The show's format includes elements that border on [[the_concept_of_exploitation_and_reality_tv | human rights violations]], such as locking bathrooms and the refrigerator behind trivia questions. This is seen as a way to create forced drama, although it is likely a lie and they would have provided food and facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The early elimination of two contestants, just five minutes into the first episode, is interpreted as a deliberate attempt to "break down as many people's self-confidence as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, with hosts acting like "demons that feed off of breaking the spirit of these young hopeful models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

The overarching [[critique_of_reality_tv_and_its_portrayal_of_relationships | critique of reality TV and its portrayal of relationships]] suggests that *America's Most Smartest Model* exemplifies the "really mean" nature of reality television in 2007, where producers "could just say anything" for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

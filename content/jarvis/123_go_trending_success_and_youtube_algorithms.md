## Channel Growth and Expansion
Since a previous discussion six months prior, [[123_go_youtube_channel | 123 Go]] has reportedly doubled in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This growth has led to the creation of several new channels, including:
*   [[123_go_youtube_channel | 123 Go Challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>
*   [[123_go_youtube_channel | 123 Go Play]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>
*   [[123_go_youtube_channel | 123 Go Gold Gold Gold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>

The [[discussion_about_youtube_channel_growth | discussion about YouTube channel growth]] notes that even new channels like "123 Go Play," with only two videos, managed to accumulate over 5 million views each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Presence on the YouTube Trending Page
[[123_go_youtube_channel | 123 Go]] content frequently appears on YouTube's trending page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. On one occasion, three of their videos were simultaneously featured on the trending page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This success is often noted with sarcasm, as the trending page is colloquially regarded as showcasing "the best stuff on YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Content Strategy and the [[youtube_algorithm_and_channel_content_strategy | YouTube Algorithm]]
Observations suggest that [[123_go_youtube_channel | 123 Go]] employs specific strategies that align with the [[youtube_algorithm_and_channel_content_strategy | YouTube algorithm]].
*   **Repetitive Content**: It is noted that videos across different [[123_go_youtube_channel | 123 Go]] channels are "literally the same videos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. This repetition seems to be a deliberate tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Video Manipulation**: There is speculation that videos are intentionally shot in reverse or otherwise altered to bypass YouTube's content detection systems and allow for uploads to multiple channels without being flagged as duplicate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>. This approach appears to be part of a broader strategy to "clean" the channel and improve visibility within the [[youtube_algorithm_and_channel_content_strategy | YouTube algorithm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

Despite its success on the trending page, some [[123_go_youtube_channel | 123 Go]] videos exhibit an "awful like to dislike ratio," indicating a discrepancy between algorithmic promotion and audience reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>. This highlights potential [[issues_with_youtube_algorithm_and_trending_page | issues with YouTube algorithm and trending page]] in reflecting genuine audience preference.

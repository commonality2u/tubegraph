The YouTube channel "Seven Second Riddles", from the creators of Five-Minute Crafts, has been identified as a significant example of [[criticism_of_lowquality_content_on_youtube_channels | low-quality content on YouTube]]. The content is confusing and its target audience is unclear, with many criticisms focusing on its problematic nature rather than obvious flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Characteristics of Sensationalist Content

"Seven Second Riddles" exhibits several characteristics that contribute to its classification as sensationalist:
*   **High Volume Posting** The channel uploads new videos approximately five times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Clickbait Titles** Videos often claim to boost IQ or suggest that "only geniuses" or "the top 1%" can solve the riddles, using unrelated and "weird titles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Examples include "only the X-Men can solve this" or "only people with good relationships with their fathers can pass this quiz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Salacious Thumbnails** Thumbnails feature cartoon scenes posing provocative questions such as "who's telling the truth" or "who killed the math teacher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Dark Thematic Content** The riddles frequently deal with dark themes like crime, death, lying, cheating, and poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This includes disturbing narratives, such as a dead dog in a garden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, a murdered old man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, or a person bleeding out in a public bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The visual content can be graphic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Problematic Riddle "Logic"** Many riddles rely on dubious or offensive logic, such as determining poverty based on someone possessing a watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, or using a necklace as proof of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. One riddle implies a homeless person with a laptop is "trash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Psychological Impact

A significant concern with sensationalist content, including channels like "Seven Second Riddles," Bright Side, and Facts Verse, is its potentially harmful [[impact_of_sensationalist_content_on_children | impact on young people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This harm is related to two psychological biases:

*   **Availability Heuristic** This cognitive bias leads individuals to believe that events are more likely if they can easily recall examples of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. For instance, people might fear flying more than driving because plane crashes receive more news coverage, even though driving is statistically less safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Negativity Bias** Humans are naturally more drawn to unpleasant things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

When combined with the YouTube algorithm, these biases can distort a viewer's perception of reality, making the world seem "way bleaker than it actually is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The use of cartoons exacerbates this problem, as it makes the content more appealing to a younger audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Building entire channels around murder and negative events can be seen as exploitative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This type of content can make viewers more afraid of negative events than is realistically warranted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

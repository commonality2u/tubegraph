The online landscape has seen a peculiar evolution in [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | how brands interact]] with the public, shifting towards more human-like and humorous communication. This phenomenon, often referred to as "Brand Twitter," has been observed with companies like Wendy's and Burger King tweeting "as if they're people," which some describe as creating a "strange dystopia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. While initially engaging, this trend can become "samey," as seen with instances like Wingstop's "horny posting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. However, when something genuinely "new or interesting" emerges, it warrants attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Walmart-Target "War" on Social Media

Recently, a "war" erupted primarily on [[social_media_platforms_and_content_imitation | TikTok]], but also Twitter, between two major retail giants, Target and Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This conflict began over shopping carts and escalated to include elements of bullying, theft, corporate espionage, and the exploitation of undervalued employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Employee-Driven Origins and Escalation

The "war" originated from a lone Target employee named Jaden, who found a Walmart shopping cart and created a viral TikTok video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

> "Hello, this is a message to Walmart from Target. We are currently holding one of your shopping carts hostage. You have 24 hours to respond, or else." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>

The "or else" involved Jaden humorously pushing a Target cart into the Walmart cart as a "threatening gesture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This lighthearted, bored-employee-at-work content captured the "essence of TikTok" and quickly went viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Jaden continued the narrative with a follow-up:

> "We still have your cart. We've kept it guarded behind bars but as each hour goes by it screams for help only get louder and louder. You can see the sweat dripping off of it from the torture it's endured." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>

Jaden, seemingly a young employee, spoke "on behalf of Target" without official authorization, highlighting the organic, [[employeedriven_social_media_trends_and_brand_capitalisation | employee-driven nature]] of the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Brand Capitalization and Official Responses

Seeing the virality, Walmart's marketing team capitalized on the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Their response TikTok featured a Target store ball wearing a Walmart jacket and a name tag, which the speaker found "hilarious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The laugh of the person in the Walmart TikTok was humorously described as sounding "like a multi-billion dollar corporation would laugh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

This exchange initiated an "arms race" to continue the viral moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Target's official account responded with a video featuring a "war general ball" calling upon "Avengers of Target's corporate partners" like Starbucks, Ulta, Disney, and Apple Rangers to take back their "own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The choice to use "annoying orange style eyeballs and mouth on a ball" was found "unsettling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### [[consumer_behavior_and_brand_interactions_on_social_media | Consumer Behavior]] and Brand Engagement

The comments section of Target's TikTok revealed other [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brands trying to get involved]], such as "Pizza Hut Express Ranger" offering assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Unsettlingly, some TikTok users reacted as if Target were a small, up-and-coming creator, leaving comments like "here before you get one no followers," despite it being a "multi-billion dollar corporation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Employee-Driven Humor vs. Corporate Content

The speaker noted that other random employees getting involved were "always funnier than than what the brand is doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. A Walmart employee, Colton Runs 2003, emerged as a prominent figure, creating cinematic TikToks where he acted as a "war general slash the night king" corralling an "army of shopping carts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Colton even "personally stole a cart from Target," which was noted as "for sure illegal" but tolerated due to the "brand marketing of it all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

Jaden later responded, framing the stolen Walmart cart as a "double agent" or "Trojan horse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, implying the cart was intentionally captured to leak "hundreds of company secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

The "war" took a "gruesome turn" with a video depicting Walmart employees "brutalizing a poor target card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This spurred Target employees nationwide to "arm themselves fictionally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Even neutral parties like Home Depot were "pulled into the fray," taking Walmart's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Amazon also appeared, stationed outside a Walmart base, prompting a Walmart employee to state, "This is between us and Target, so stay out of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

### Post-War and [[Marketing strategies involving humor and memes | Meme Integration]]

After the initial peak, tensions cooled, entering a "cold war era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. However, the "devious licks" trend later crossed over into the Walmart-Target "war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

The speaker believes the "war" was genuinely started by "a few random employees" and that the companies merely "saw an opportunity and capitalized on it" because the TikToks were already viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. The positive outcome is that these employees were not fired, providing "free advertising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. The speaker expressed hope that employees were compensated for their contributions, as [[brands_using_social_media_for_relatable_content | brands pay substantial amounts]] for this type of attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

On Twitter, the feud resurfaced, with Walmart and Target engaging in a public spat. Walmart's official Twitter account asked Target, "why should we follow you?" Target replied, "because we're not walmart." Walmart then used the "mariah carey why you so obsessed with me meme" in response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. This indicated that [[criticism_of_corporate_twitter_accounts | Brand Twitter]] was "back at it again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

While the overall trend is "mostly harmless," it's important to remember that corporations are "profiting off of our attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. However, for the employees posting from their personal accounts, it offers an opportunity to gain followers and views, potentially leading to further opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This peculiar "war" is just one example of the "very weird thing that's happening on the internet that's with brands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. The potential for future "wars," such as a "FedEx UPS war," highlights the ongoing evolution of [[behind_the_scenes_of_social_media_management_for_brands | brand engagement]] in the [[social_media_industry_and_job_roles | social media industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The concept of "alpha male pickup artists" is prevalent online, with new figures emerging daily to share their worldview with impressionable followers who may wish to emulate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. However, there's a strong argument that [[the_concept_of_alpha_males_and_their_beliefs | alpha males]] don't exist, and the advice given is a scam designed to exploit vulnerable followers, potentially leading to harmful outcomes and scaring women away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Women are not monolithic and cannot be "trained like dogs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Misguided Advice and its Consequences

One self-proclaimed alpha male, Zay Double Edge, offers [[advice_on_masculinity_and_selfperception | advice on masculinity and self-perception]] through TikTok videos and an e-book titled "Stop Getting Left on Red, Get Nudes Instead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. His guidance includes several concerning points:

### Detachment and Manipulation
*   **Not taking women seriously**: Zay advises men not to take women seriously in the initial stages of a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. He suggests that a "real woman should have to almost beat you up just so you can take her seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This approach treats relationships as a "game" that is "supposed to be fun," warning that viewing it otherwise leads to "hating women" and giving off "hateful energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **[[misconceptions_about_women_and_manipulative_behaviors | Misconceptions about women and manipulative behaviors]]**: According to Zay, women employ manipulation strategies, such as posting indirect pictures on social media (e.g., empty wine glasses) to show they're moving on or to test a man's weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. He claims a "strong" man will not respond, causing the woman to "come back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Redefining Masculinity
*   **Criticism of "Simps"**: Zay claims American men are "programmed to be simps," making American women "hard to deal with and arrogant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **"Dying on Principles"**: He asserts that men should "stand on principles" and "say whatever the f*** you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. He hyperbolically states that a "real man is gonna die on his principles" and suggests figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Osama Bin Laden as examples of those who "died on principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Suppression of Emotions**: Men are advised never to express their feelings, especially when a woman pressures them to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Expressing emotions is seen as a sign of insecurity and powerlessness, characteristic of a "beta male simp mangina" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Women as "Programmable"**: Zay explicitly states that "women are programmable" and that a woman's past experiences with men can "program" her not to appreciate being treated well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. He measures a woman's attraction level by "how compliant she is" and suggests that her "feminine nature will make her like you" if she complies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### Core Masculinity Principles
Zay outlines "deep rooted core masculinity principles" that he claims a father or brother should have taught:
1.  **Never ask for a favor with an empty hand**: He criticizes followers who ask for free advice without offering anything in return, labeling them as "beta male" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
2.  **Never tolerate disrespect**: A man "should rather be put six feet under than to be disrespected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
3.  **Always be alert**: Men should never walk around with their heads down but always be aware of their surroundings to avoid being robbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## The Burdens of Being an Alpha Male

The speaker of the video concludes that trying to become an alpha male is "too hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The lifestyle, as presented by Zay, comes with significant burdens and negative aspects:
*   **Women don't even like them**: Despite the advice, the speaker notes that women don't like alpha males <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **Denial of emotions**: Alpha males are expected to constantly deny their own emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
*   **Constant vigilance**: There's a constant worry about being robbed, requiring perpetual alertness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Embracing death**: The extreme principle of "dying on principles" suggests a dangerous and unnecessary adherence to rigid rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

Ultimately, the speaker decides that "it just seems easier to be myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. He encourages viewers to "be whatever you are," reassuring them that "you're doing just fine and you get to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. A key takeaway is the importance of not engaging in [[misconceptions_about_women_and_manipulative_behaviors | manipulative behaviors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

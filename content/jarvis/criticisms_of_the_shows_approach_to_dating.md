*Sexy Beasts* is a Netflix dating show that attempts to put a unique spin on the traditional dating format by having contestants wear elaborate prosthetic masks, transforming them into various "beasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The show is an entry into Netflix's expanding collection of dating shows, which include premises like "dating but you can't have sex" and "dating but instead of seeing a person you see a pulsating blue wall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is based on a BBC Three show of the same name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

However, despite its unique premise, *Sexy Beasts* faces significant [[critique_of_dating_show_premises | criticism regarding its approach to dating]].

## Superficiality and Misleading Premise

The core premise of *Sexy Beasts* asks if one can fall in love based on personality alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. However, the show is criticized for failing to adequately address this question because contestants are "just wearing masks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The reviewer suggests that [[the_concept_and_criticism_of_love_is_blind_as_a_dating_show | Love is Blind]] was a "much better test" of this concept, despite its own perceived flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

A major point of [[critique_of_reality_tv_and_its_portrayal_of_relationships | criticism]] is that the show's focus remains largely superficial:
*   Contestants can still see each other's eyes and other features despite the masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   After the masks are removed, all contestants are revealed to be "normal regular everyday models" and "very attractive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This suggests that the show ultimately prioritizes physical attractiveness, contradicting its stated goal of dating based on personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

The concept of a "beast" is also inconsistently applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Some contestants are "cute pandas" while others are "boiling trolls" or "ununfortunately faced" individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This inconsistency means that some masks are perceived as "way harder to look at" than others, leading to situations where contestants are "eliminated first" likely due to their less appealing mask, highlighting a superficial aspect to the elimination process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Unrealistic and Unhelpful for Real-Life Dating

The show's premise is deemed unhelpful for real-life dating scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The reviewer notes that most people will not appear on a Netflix dating show, and attempting to replicate the "beast" concept by showing up to a regular date in a "demon mask" would not be well-received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The show's exaggerated premise offers no practical advice for navigating modern dating.

## Structured for Entertainment, Not Genuine Connection

*Sexy Beasts* follows a formula more akin to MTV's *Next* than to shows like [[the_concept_and_criticism_of_love_is_blind_as_a_dating_show | Love is Blind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Each episode features one main "beast" going on dates with three other "beasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The structure involves:
1.  A basic bar date with three individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
2.  One elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
3.  A more in-depth date with the remaining two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
4.  The final choice of a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

This format, with dates happening "on the same day," is seen as limiting the potential for genuine connection, as contestants spend only a "couple of months" in makeup total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The dates themselves are often described as "super boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Furthermore, there is a perception of unfairness in the dating activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. For example, one contestant might go on a "bowling date" while another experiences a more "romantic" "horse-drawn carriage" ride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This suggests that the "odds are stacked" for certain participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

The show also features a "typical snarky Netflix narrator" who tries to inject humor into the proceedings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Problematic Contestant Behavior

The show also highlights problematic contestant behavior, exemplified by "Rhino dude" (Mick). Despite the disclaimer that viewers are commenting on "characters of the show" and not the actual people due to "selective editing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, Mick's on-screen persona is heavily criticized. He is described as a "holistic health practitioner from LA" who refers to himself as a "techno prince warrior poet monkey man spiritual cowboy on the hero's journey to liberate humankind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. His conversation includes strange concepts like "sex kung fu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a> and out-of-place meditation sessions on dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. His declarations and behavior are deemed "too much" and "make my skin crawl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Upon winning, he refers to his date as "babe" despite having just met her that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. This portrayal contributes to the overall [[examination_of_toxic_behavior_on_dating_shows | critique of toxic behavior on dating shows]].

Overall, *Sexy Beasts* is seen as an entertaining but ultimately flawed dating show that struggles to live up to its unique premise, instead falling back on superficial elements and an unhelpful format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

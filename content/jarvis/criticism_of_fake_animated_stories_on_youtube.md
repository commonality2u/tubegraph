From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Initial intentions for discussing animated stories were to focus on lighthearted content, but an upsetting viral story about a prince accepting a princess who "turned ugly" (meaning Black) shifted the focus to more problematic animated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This led to an investigation into popular [[critique_of_animated_story_channels | animated story channels]] like "Actually Happened" and "My Story Animated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Nature of the Problem

These channels, which claim to tell "completely true stories" from kids, are provably false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The [[proliferation_of_fake_animated_story_channels_on_youtube | proliferation of fake animated story channels on YouTube]] has reached a point where it is "not funny anymore," suggesting YouTube needs to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Sensationalism and Misleading Content
The videos often feature highly sensational titles and storylines, such as:
*   "My Stepmother Hated Me So I Had To Move Out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   "I Was Switched At Birth With Another Baby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   "I Got Pregnant At 15 And My Boyfriend Is Shocked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>

The popularity of channels like "Actually Happened," which boast millions of subscribers, has led to numerous copycats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Proof of Fabricated Stories
Previous investigations revealed that "Actually Happened" stole stories from Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. A job posting for these channels explicitly stated that writers should "make up the story" and it only needs to "sound plausible," recommending the use of real people's stories from social media as references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Stories are to be written in "lively colloquial English" so "American viewers should feel that your central characters are native English speakers," with a recommendation to translate the text into Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Parody and Uncanny Similarity
The difficulty in distinguishing real animated story videos from parody content highlights the absurdity of the current landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. A website, animatedstorytitles.com, generates random titles for non-existent animated stories based on existing ones, and these generated titles are often indistinguishable from actual video titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. For example, titles like "I Was Afraid of the Government So I Got a Baby to Save My Parents" and "My Parents Left Me for Dead So I Became a Star" are, in fact, real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Problematic Content and Themes

### Exploitation of Serious Topics
These channels frequently take serious and often inappropriate subjects and treat them without care, resembling soap operas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

*   **"My Parents Left Me to Die, But I Survived and Became a Star"**: This video features a child's story about being left by parents, a medical bill paid with a baby, and an inappropriate Mario coin sound effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The story attempts to inspire but belittles individual struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. It depicts a "drama academy" that functions more like a brutal martial arts boot camp, even including a clause where parents waive rights if their child is injured or dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

*   **Misappropriation of Celebrity Stories**: "My Parents Left Me to Die, But I Survived and Became a Star" attempts to portray itself as the origin story of Jackie Chan, despite it not being accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Another video, "I Was So Poor I Wore a Potato Sack Dress to School, Now All the World Knows Me," features a woman wearing a name tag saying "OPRAH" and identifies the character as Oprah Winfrey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This is considered misleading, as the audience might believe real celebrities are collaborating with the channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

*   **"I Was Afraid of the Government So I Got a Baby!"**: This video initially titled "The Government FORCED Me to Get a Baby to Save My Parents," centers on an undocumented immigrant family in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. It irresponsibly addresses sensitive topics like immigration by depicting a 16-year-old manipulating her American boyfriend into getting her pregnant to prevent her family's deportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. The story is presented without nuance, turning a serious issue into a soap opera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### Low Quality and Repetitive Content
Channels like "My Story Animated" are known for "straight garbage" content, with videos like "I'm Too Pretty" and "I'm the Richest Girl at School, and That's Embarrassing!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The [[proliferation_of_fake_animated_story_channels_on_youtube | channels]] often use identical thumbnails and equally outlandish stories, leading to a "race to the bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Many channels duplicate similar topics, such as "My Dad Is A Deputy" appearing across four different channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

The channel "My Story" is highlighted for its particularly poor quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Topics are often nonsensical, such as "My Parents Became Informal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. These "content farms" are primarily designed to make money, with many based in Eastern Europe, specifically Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

*   **"My Parents Became Informal"**: This video, with its obvious Russian origins, bafflingly describes a family who buys a motor home and travels, with the only "conflict" being the child's inability to play computer games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The narration is often redundant and the animation bizarre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

*   **Disrespectful Treatment of Serious Events**: "My Story" also features videos like "I Became a Millionaire at 17," which is revealed to be about earning 40,000 rubles ($630) a month in Russia, making the "millionaire" claim misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. Another video, "My Grandmother is a Man," duplicates across channels and, while not directly offensive, becomes so due to framing mundane events as dramatic revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. This video features a grandmother who cuts wood with a chainsaw and remains unfazed after injuring her leg with it, highlighting the lack of realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

### Teen Pregnancy Narratives
A particularly prevalent and inappropriate theme across these channels is teen pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. Videos escalate in their sensationalism, with titles like "I Got Pregnant at 16," "15," "13," and even "My Story"'s "I Got Pregnant at 12!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. These stories are not treated with the seriousness required, especially when aimed at children, and are instead presented like romance novels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

For instance, "I Got Pregnant at 12!" depicts a 9-year-old hiking a mountaintop, surviving an avalanche, and developing "affection and chemistry" with a boy who rescues her. Two years later, at age 12, they meet again, and the boy "looked like a man," leading to the pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

## Concerns and Impact

These channels are clearly meant for kids, with stories typically featuring 12 to 16-year-olds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. Despite this, they contain more objectionable content than animated television shows and falsely claim to be real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. The [[analysis_of_fake_animated_story_channels | channels]] demonstrate lazy sensationalism, prioritizing clicks and quick money over intellectual honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. The argument that they aim to "make the world a better place by sharing these stories" is undermined by the obvious fakeness and negligence in their storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. There is a strong call for YouTube to take responsibility and address these channels, as they violate community guidelines and continue to multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. The fact that channels like "Actually Happened" and "My Story Animated" frequently appear on YouTube's Trending page exacerbates the [[impact_of_fake_stories_on_youtube | impact of these fake stories on YouTube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

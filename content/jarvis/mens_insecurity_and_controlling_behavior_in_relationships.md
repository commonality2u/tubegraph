A "podcasting renaissance for dudes with terrible opinions" has led to the proliferation of shows that often promote harmful views on relationships, frequently rooted in male [[Jealousy and insecurity in relationships | insecurity]] and a desire for control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Podcasts like "Fresh & Fit" and "Whatever Podcast" exemplify this trend, focusing on demeaning women and imposing restrictive relationship dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Expressions of Insecurity and Control

These podcasts frequently feature discussions and questions that reveal underlying insecurities and a desire to control women's autonomy:

### Demanding "Body Count" and Restricting Social Media
Hosts often press female guests on their "body count" or whether they would give up Instagram for a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This is presented as a measure of a woman's value or loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The demand that a woman in a serious relationship "should not have an Instagram" or photos of herself online if she's not making money from it, is explicitly stated as preventing "cheating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Imposing Restrictions on Personal Freedom
A recurring theme is the hypothetical scenario where a woman is asked if she would give up going to bars, clubs, and parties to be with a man guaranteed not to cheat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. When women reject such controlling proposals, it's often framed as them being "crazy" or prioritizing personal freedom over a faithful partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Brian, the host of "Whatever Podcast," expresses a common worldview rooted in [[Jealousy and insecurity in relationships | insecurity]]: the fear that a "beautiful woman" at a club will "get hit on by Chads" and be "stolen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This perspective suggests that if a relationship only survives by controlling a partner's access to the outside world, it is based on [[Jealousy and insecurity in relationships | insecurity]] and a lack of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The idea that women might be "always looking to cheat" leads to attempts to "mitigate risk" by imposing extreme restrictions on their partners' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

> "If your girlfriend is getting attention from man which you feel is threatening and your response is to control her access to the world then that's just controlling and very insecure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>

Instead of fostering trust, these hosts propose a "bananas way to live your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. A healthier alternative is to trust your partner, and if trust is broken, to have a conversation or break up, rather than locking them in an "anti-Chad fortress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The transparency of the hosts' own sadness and [[Jealousy and insecurity in relationships | insecurity]] is often evident, as they fail to recognize that confidence and trust in a partner are more attractive qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. They appear threatened by female independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Misguided Expectations and Double Standards

Podcasts like "Whatever Podcast" often frame questions around [[misguided_relationship_goals_and_expectations | women's dating standards]] being "too high" or "delusional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Despite claiming to discuss "modern dating," they frequently promote "Traditional Values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The hosts project their own insecurities, such as believing women will cheat if given the chance, onto their female guests, thereby generating [[misconceptions_about_women_and_manipulative_behaviors | misconceptions about women and manipulative behaviors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

One host, Brian, complains about his experiences on Bumble, where women's first messages were often just "hey" despite his "interesting as sh*t profile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This highlights a double standard where men expect women to put in significant effort while simultaneously expressing dissatisfaction when women don't conform to their idealized behaviors.

## The "Alpha Male" Facade and its Harmful Effects

Hosts often attempt to assert "masculine dominance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> by kicking guests off the show if they disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This behavior, portrayed as what "big strong men do when faced with adversity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, is a manifestation of [[the_concept_of_alpha_males_and_their_beliefs | the concept of alpha males and their beliefs]] but often comes across as weak and insecure. Brian, for example, is described as "grumbling meekly" and looking off-screen for reassurance, contrasting with the forced dominance of other hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. His co-host is a sex doll, Kiki, which is seen as a transparent objectification of women and a stark symbol of his controlling desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

This [[commentary_on_stereotypical_masculinity | commentary on stereotypical masculinity]] and its failure to address real [[advice_on_masculinity_and_selfperception | advice on masculinity and self-perception]] often results in discussions that are transparently sad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The hosts' insecurities are evident in their own experiences, such as Brian's "saddest stories" about going to bars where "nobody's going to talk to him the entire night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Audience Engagement and Reinforcement of Harmful Narratives

The live chat feature of these podcasts allows for real-time reinforcement of women-hating sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Viewers often use terms like "W man" for male speakers and "dumb lady bad lady" for women, frequently spamming "304," a code for "hoe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. This behavior is enabled by the hosts, who laugh at or offer "full-throated support" for body shaming and other demeaning comments when viewers donate money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

The community fostered by these podcasts consists of "lost men" who outwardly hate women but privately seek their approval, sometimes spending hundreds of dollars to have an ongoing conversation or ask women to rate their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. This dynamic highlights the deep-seated [[Jealousy and insecurity in relationships | insecurity]] and the problematic ways these platforms monetize and amplify such [[challenging_relationship_dynamics | challenging relationship dynamics]]. The shows are often described as boring, with no one, including the hosts, appearing to enjoy themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Brian himself is seen as a "reluctant misogyny profiteer," possibly not even believing what he says, but participating for financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. The show's format, including kicking off guests for disagreement, appears to be a direct imitation of other misogynistic podcasts like "Fresh & Fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

The YouTube channel "Actually Happened" serves as a case study for the [[impact_of_fake_stories_on_youtube | impact of fake stories on YouTube]] and how fabricated narratives can manipulate audience perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. While claiming to share personal, true stories turned into animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, evidence suggests its content is entirely fictionalized, plagiarized, or based on vague, generic, and provably false premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This intentional deception has significant implications for how viewers engage with and understand digital content.

## Deceptive Practices of "Actually Happened"

"Actually Happened" is a channel created by The Soul Publishing, the same company behind "5-Minute Crafts" and "Brightside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. These channels are known for abusing the YouTube algorithm by prioritizing quantity over quality and engaging in plagiarism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. "Actually Happened" similarly operates under false pretenses:
*   **False Claims of Authenticity** The channel describes itself as a platform for real people to share their personal stories, with the only criteria being that the story "must be true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. In reality, there is no such submission platform; stories are submitted via a generic email address used across all their channels, `welcome@brightside.me` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Corporate Fabrication** The channel employs scriptwriters who are "fully responsible for the quality of stories told by our characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. These scriptwriters are instructed to create "real-life stories told by American teenagers aged up to 16," ensuring "believability" so that stories "sound like they're told by a real teenager and be as close to real life as possible without creating a sense that they're fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Plagiarism and Generic Narratives** Many of the channel's stories are vague, generic, demonstrably false, or stolen from the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. For example:
    *   "I broke up with my girlfriend because of potatoes" is a story previously posted to the "Today I Fucked Up" subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   Stories like "I became a criminal but was suddenly caught" are intentionally vague and rely on anonymity to avoid scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   "I rebelled at school bands but it went too far," featuring a fabricated story about an enormous swimming pool in a library and a viral social media campaign about confiscated bananas and water bottles, has no verifiable record on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Impact on Audience Perception

The deliberate fabrication of stories has a direct [[impact_of_fake_stories_on_youtube | impact on fake stories on YouTube]] and [[impact_of_fictional_influencers_on_audiences | fictional influencers on audiences]], leading to several negative consequences:
*   **Emotional Manipulation** The channel frequently uses "dramatic elements like divorce and mental breakdowns and depression and disease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. They exploit "people in very vulnerable situations as clickbait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. For instance, the video "My mom woke up from a coma and it's terrifying" elicits genuine sympathy and emotional responses from viewers who believe it's a real story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This emotional energy is wasted on fictional narratives, primarily serving to increase comment metrics and views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Blurring of Reality and Fiction** The primary issue is the intentional blurring of lines between real life and drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Viewers click on these videos because they believe they are real, expecting genuine experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
    > [!WARNING] Consequences of Deception
    > Lying about drama being real life "has consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This deceptive practice undermines trust in digital content and can lead to a desensitization to genuine human experiences.
*   **Influence of Sensationalism** The channel's content is described as "super dishonest" at best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This aligns with [[sensationalism_in_digital_storytelling | sensationalism in digital storytelling]] and the [[influence_of_sensational_content_on_viewer_engagement | influence of sensational content on viewer engagement]], as the dramatic and often tragic themes are designed to capture attention, even if they are not true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Fictional Influencers** The situation is comparable to "Lonelygirl15," an early vlogger who gained popularity living an "interesting life" until it was revealed she was an actress filmed in a studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:19:08]</a>. The popularity of such content dies "when it was fake because we have different expectations of real life and drama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:15]</a>.

## Role of Platforms and Audience Education

YouTube's platform "co-signs" these channels by featuring "Actually Happened" videos on its trending page, despite their fabricated nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This promotion amplifies the reach of dishonest content.
> [!INFO] Call for Platform Responsibility
> It is suggested that YouTube, as a platform, should be more critical of what it promotes on its trending page, much like creators are expected to be rigorous with who they promote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

The prevalence of such channels highlights the need for viewers to be more critical of the content they consume on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This aligns with the broader topic of [[community_backlash_and_the_role_of_audience_education | community backlash and the role of audience education]] in discerning credible digital narratives.

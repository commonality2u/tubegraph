The YouTube channel "Seven Second Riddles," created by the same team behind "Five-Minute Crafts," is primarily dedicated to riddles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Despite claiming to boost IQ or be solvable only by geniuses, its content is often problematic and misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of Seven Second Riddles' Content

The channel uploads content multiple times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Its videos frequently feature [[the_impact_of_clickbait_and_misleading_thumbnails | clickbait]] titles and thumbnails, often posing salacious or absurd questions like "who's telling the truth" or "who killed the math teacher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The riddles themselves are consistently dark, focusing on themes such as crime, death, lying, cheating, and even poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Many riddles present scenarios where only one of the depicted characters could be the culprit, often implying [[judgment_and_hypocrisy_in_social_narratives | judgmental]] or illogical conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For example, a riddle about identifying a poor man suggests that owning a watch means one isn't poor, despite homeless people potentially owning smartphones and smartwatches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Another riddle implies that an entire family might be involved in murdering a pet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## The Availability Heuristic and Negativity Bias

The highly sensationalist nature of channels like "Seven Second Riddles," "Facts Verse," and "Bright Side" is considered harmful, particularly to young audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This harm stems from the interplay of two psychological biases: the [[impact_of_fabricated_stories_on_audience_perceptions | availability heuristic]] and the negativity bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

> [!INFO] The Availability Heuristic
> This bias suggests that people believe events are more likely if they have more examples of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. For instance, extensive news coverage of plane crashes might lead people to fear flying more than driving, even though driving is statistically much less safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

> [!INFO] Negativity Bias
> Humans are naturally more attracted to unpleasant or negative information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

When the [[impact_of_fabricated_stories_on_audience_perceptions | availability heuristic]] and the negativity bias combine with the influence of the YouTube algorithm, it can distort an individual's sense of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This can lead people to perceive the world as much bleaker than it actually is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The use of cartoons in these videos further exacerbates the problem by appealing to a younger demographic, making them more susceptible to these biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Exploitation of Bias
> Building entire channels around themes of murder and negative events is seen as exploitative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. While a degree of fear about negative events is natural, these channels can inflate the perceived likelihood of such occurrences beyond reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The world is not as filled with murder, lying, or dark riddles as these channels might portray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

One of [[gettys_unique_recipes|Getty's unique recipes]] featured as a [[tiktok_cooking_hacks|TikTok cooking hack]] is her "patented" Flamin Hot Cheeto mac and cheese, which she creates from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Preparation Process

The recipe involves boiling Flamin Hot Cheetos in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. To add a "hint of lime," Getty includes lime-flavored Flamin Hot Cheetos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. A notable omission from the instructions is the precise amount of water needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

After boiling the Cheetos, regular mac and cheese powder or cheese is added to the mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. The orange color observed during the process is attributed to the Cheeto powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. The boiling process results in a "creamy goodness" consistency as the corn snack melts down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

## Appearance and Taste

The concoction is described as having a "bright red" color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a> and a strong, "foul" smell, similar to corn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:00">[23:48:00]</a>. It can be lumpy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a> and, after sitting, transforms into a solid, pudding-like consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>.

Despite its unique preparation, the taste test yields disappointing results. The dish "tastes like nothing" and lacks the expected "kick" of Flamin Hot Cheetos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. The final product is also referred to as "liquid cheetos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>.

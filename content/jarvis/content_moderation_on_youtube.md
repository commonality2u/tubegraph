The proliferation of animated story channels on YouTube has raised significant concerns regarding [[content_moderation_on_youtube | content moderation]] on the platform. The speaker expresses a strong belief that YouTube needs to intervene due to the escalating issues with these channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Issues with Animated Story Channels

These channels are characterized by their claims of telling "completely true stories" from kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, which are often "provably lies" and highly sensational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Examples of their sensationalist titles include "My Stepmother Hated Me So I Had To Move Out," "I Was Switched At Birth With Another Baby," and "I Got Pregnant At 15 And My Boyfriend Is Shocked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This contributes to a broader [[criticism_of_sensationalist_content_on_youtube | criticism of sensationalist content on YouTube]].

### Deceptive Practices and Content Appropriation
Channels like "Actually Happened" were found to be stealing stories from Reddit and openly soliciting writers to "make up the story" as long as it sounds plausible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. They also encourage using references from real people's social media platforms and writing in "lively colloquial English" for "American viewers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. There are also [[ethical_concerns_about_content_appropriation_on_youtube | ethical concerns about content appropriation on YouTube]], as some videos appropriate the origin stories of famous individuals like Jackie Chan and Oprah Winfrey, altering details for drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The speaker questions whether this is permissible and notes the misleading nature of implying collaboration with such figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. These issues touch upon [[fair_use_and_copyright_issues_on_youtube | fair use and copyright issues on YouTube]].

### Inappropriate Content and Lack of Nuance
A significant criticism is how these channels handle serious and sensitive topics, treating them like "soap operas" rather than with the necessary care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

Teen pregnancy is highlighted as a pervasive and particularly concerning topic across these channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Despite being "clearly meant for kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>, these stories portray sensitive subjects with a distinct lack of seriousness, often resembling romance novels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. This points to [[the_issue_of_inappropriate_childrens_content_on_youtube | the issue of inappropriate children's content on YouTube]] and concerns about [[age_restrictions_on_youtube | age restrictions on YouTube]].

The content, focusing on 12 to 16-year-olds and their parents, is explicitly animated and directed at children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. The speaker argues that these videos contain more objectionable content than current animated television shows and, unlike cartoons, they falsely pretend to be real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

## Call for Action

The speaker believes these videos likely violate YouTube's community guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. Despite the problematic content, popular channels like "Actually Happened" and "My Story Animated" have frequently appeared on YouTube's Trending page, indicating promotion by the [[youtube_algorithm_and_channel_content_strategy | YouTube algorithm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. This suggests a failure in [[content_moderation_on_youtube | content moderation on YouTube]] that allows such channels to flourish and multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

The speaker condemns this "lazy sensationalism" as a means to gain clicks and make "quick buck[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. It is asserted that creators have a responsibility not to make up stories or handle sensitive subjects negligently, especially when presenting them as "kids story[ies]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. The proliferation of these channels highlights ongoing [[discussion_on_youtube_content_creation_challenges | discussion on YouTube content creation challenges]] and the struggle with [[content_farms_on_youtube | content farms on YouTube]].

Recent concerns have highlighted videos on YouTube that are clearly intended for kids but perhaps "shouldn't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While discussions often focus on content for the youngest children, like the YouTube Kids app or educational animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, attention is increasingly shifting to content targeted at preteens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Content for Preteens and [[age_restrictions_on_youtube | Age Restrictions]]
Despite a technical rule requiring users to be at least 13 to be on regular YouTube, it's evident that children bypass this by lying about their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. An example is a "Bright Side" video titled "This Map Trick Will Guess Your Age," where comments reveal many users under 13 stating the video guessed their age incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This presence of preteens on the platform attracts creators looking to "squeeze the ad dollars out of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Sub-genres and [[criticism_of_sensationalist_content_on_youtube | Sensationalist Content]]
An entire sub-genre exists on YouTube dedicated to "creeping kids out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This includes the "3 A.M. Challenge," where videos feature titles like "Barney is haunted" or "Calling Barney on FaceTime at 3 AM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These videos specifically target a younger demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Case Study: JayStation's "Dark Web Potions"
A prominent offender in this trend is a creator named JayStation, whose content largely focuses on unsettling children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. His channel features a variety of "upsetting content" including Freddy Krueger, Mike Myers, and Cookie Monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Other creators like Deanna Gonzales and Cody Cove have made videos discussing JayStation and the 3 A.M. challenge trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

A more recent trend involves pretending to order "magic potions from the dark web" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The "dark web" in these videos is merely a stand-in for a "creepy Internet place," as the creators themselves likely don't understand its true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. These "potions" are supposed to grant creepy or magical powers like shape-shifting or teleporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

#### The "Gay Potion" Series
One specific example of this trend is the video "We kissed ordering gay potion from the dark web at 3 AM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The premise of these videos is that "being gay is like spooky," making them "mega homophobic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Despite claiming to be straight, the creators, who are full-grown adults (one is 28 years old) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, perpetuate harmful stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. The video portrays being gay with stereotypical impressions, non-consensual touching, and applying lipstick as a sign of being gay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The core of the video's premise relies on "systemic homophobia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

The series includes follow-up videos where Kermit the Frog is forced to drink the "gay potion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, and another where a "baby and gay potion" are mixed to create a "gay baby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. The comments section of these videos reveals that the target audience includes children who believe the content is real and find it compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, alongside viewers who are disgusted and offended by the homophobia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

## [[ethical_concerns_about_content_appropriation_on_youtube | Ethical Concerns]] and [[ethics_of_sensational_content_for_children | Ethics of Sensational Content for Children]]
These videos raise significant [[ethical_concerns_about_content_appropriation_on_youtube | ethical concerns about content appropriation on YouTube]], particularly regarding [[youtube_content_targeting_children | YouTube content targeting children]]. The creator notes that while the videos are meant to be entertaining, they come "at the expense of a marginalized group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. They are seen as a "clear money grab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, mixing "clout chasing with ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>, which can cause "real pain for people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. The use of characters like Kermit the Frog in such content also raises [[copyright_issues_and_content_plagiarism_on_youtube | copyright issues]] and reflects a deviation from their original intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

## Positive Alternatives
In contrast to harmful content, there is an abundance of media that offers positive and genuine portrayals of LGBTQ+ individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. These include podcasts like "The Bright Sessions," which features characters with superpowers processing emotions through therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Additionally, various YouTubers, such as Jackson Byrd, It's Radish Time, Asante Be, and Rowan Ellis, create content without resorting to queerbaiting or harmful stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. The goal of such content is to make kids and adults "feel less alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

[[dan_bilzerians_social_media_persona | Dan Bilzerian]] is often referred to by his PR firm as "the king of Instagram" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. His extravagant Instagram presence has inspired many, making him the "face of working hard and playing hard," though allegedly without the "work" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. With 32 million followers, his feed is dedicated to weed, guns, and a "harem of scantily clad women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Financial Discrepancies and Lavish Spending

Despite his public image as a self-made billionaire playboy, it turns out [[controversies_surrounding_dan_bilzerians_wealth | Dan Bilzerian]] doesn't finance his lavish life of yachts and other luxuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

### Questionable Wealth Origins
Many speculate about the source of Bilzerian's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. He is the son of Paul Bilzerian, a convicted corporate fraudster who was ordered to pay back $60 million to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Allegedly, Paul Bilzerian's missing $50+ million is still hidden in secret trusts and shell companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Unrelatedly, [[dan_bilzerians_social_media_persona | Dan Bilzerian]] mysteriously won $50 million playing poker in one year, which is more than any professional poker player has made in their entire lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

### Ignite Company Losses
In 2017, [[dan_bilzerians_social_media_persona | Dan Bilzerian]] founded a company called Ignite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. The company lost $50 million last year, despite making about $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Ignite is currently being sued by its former president, Curtis Heffernan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Heffernan attributes the $50 million loss entirely to [[dan_bilzerians_social_media_persona | Dan Bilzerian]]'s "buckwild spending habits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Specific Examples of Fabricated Image
According to the former president of Ignite, everything surrounding [[dan_bilzerians_social_media_persona | Dan Bilzerian]]'s lavish lifestyle is paid for by his company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

*   **Mansion**: His "fancy mansion" is rented by his company for $200,000 a month, and he was recently kicked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
*   **Luxuries**: Allegedly, he does not pay for the yachts, the rented models, or even his own $50,000 bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Instagram Content**: Essentially, everything [[dan_bilzerians_social_media_persona | Dan Bilzerian]] claims to be, except his beard, is fabricated for Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Fake Book Writing**: Photos show him "writing a book" next to "hot babes," which appears staged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.
    *   **Staged Gambling**: He is shown betting small amounts of money on MMA fights, but with large stacks of cash in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. He frequently carries large amounts of physical cash, which is questioned as unusual for genuinely rich individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Unusual Chess Set**: A chess game photo features women in bathing suits on their knees as pawns, suggesting objectification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
    *   **"Pheromone-Infused" Product**: He promoted giving away $150,000 of his "pheromone-infused men's product," which is rumored to be "snake oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. The promotion photo includes stacks of cash and bongs to supplement the lack of "cleavage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.
*   **Military Claims**: He constantly talks about going through Navy SEAL training, but did not finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. He claims he was kicked out for being "too much of a badass" and that he broke both legs but continued training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:17]</a>. None of his story makes sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **"Lone Survivor" Lawsuit**: He gave $1 million to finance the movie *Lone Survivor* for an extra role, but sued when his part was cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   **Las Vegas Shooting Incident**: During the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, he tried to get a gun from a police officer, claiming to be a cop (which he is not), and his "creds" were fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. He was also filming himself in the third person during the tragedy, suggesting he cared more about his image than safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.
*   **Assault Allegations**: He allegedly kicked a model in the face with a combat boot at a nightclub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. He also allegedly threw a naked woman off a roof into a pool during a photoshoot; she broke her ankle, and his attorney reportedly implied he would blow up her possessions in the desert if she sued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.

## Unsubstantiated Claims and Contradictions

### Failed Book Deal
In 2016, [[dan_bilzerians_social_media_persona | Dan Bilzerian]] landed a book deal with Simon & Schuster but was dropped when he failed to turn in a manuscript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[00:15:09]</a>. He claims a ghostwritten version "sucked" and his new manuscript was "too badass" for the publishing company, so he would release it independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.

### Contradictory Tweets
His Twitter presence is cited as even worse than his Instagram, revealing his true nature when focusing on his words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.
*   He claims to have finished a 360-page book in 57 days, working 15 hours a day with only one day off, smoking weed three times, and going 10 days without sex, which is presented as an absurd flex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.
*   He tweeted "People who don't matter criticize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>, followed by "if someone can't swim their parents are failures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>, despite being born into privilege himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>.
*   He also states that "if you're a dude and you pay these [\h__\h] on OnlyFans you're a sucker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>, despite paying models to appear in his own photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.
*   He tweeted that "celebrities need to stop being concerned with their image" and "be authentic," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a> and "don't believe what you read in the press almost every article written has an agenda and a spin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. This is seen as ironic given his own fabricated persona and the "spin" he uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>.

## Ignite's Financial Mismanagement and Decline
Ignite's former president attributes the company's $50 million loss to [[dan_bilzerians_social_media_persona | Dan Bilzerian]]'s "buckwild spending habits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. An independent auditor stated that the company's failure is imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>.
*   Spending includes a $60,000 *Star Wars* set, the $50,000 bed frame, a $40,000 rock wall, a $15,000 ping pong table, and an $88,000 vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>.
*   Ignite reportedly took in Coronavirus aid money and tried to characterize it as income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.
*   The company also paid $26,000 to boost [[dan_bilzerians_social_media_persona | Dan Bilzerian]]'s Instagram following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. This money was spent on Ignite's business pages, which despite having hundreds of thousands of followers, had almost no engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>.
*   During the pandemic, [[dan_bilzerians_social_media_persona | Dan Bilzerian]] ignored suggestions from his former president to give up the $200,000/month mansion, insisting he wanted to host summer pool parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>. He continues to pretend the pandemic doesn't exist, traveling to countries Americans can access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>.

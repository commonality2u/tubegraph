TikTok, a popular platform known for short-form video content, has seen its share of content that raises questions about [[concerns_about_tiktok_content_and_platform_safety | cultural sensitivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Some videos have been described as "cringy" and "culturally insensitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Bollywood Videos and Cultural Appropriation
A specific example of content raising concerns includes "Bollywood videos" made by creators who are not of Indian descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. The creators' only defense for producing these dances was that they had Indian friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. These videos cause discomfort for viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. One such video included a caption about eating "Indian curry" and a body emitting "purple energy," alongside a reference to "Super Saiyan," which confused the viewer about its intended meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. After consulting experts, it was confirmed that such content is indeed "cringy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

## Content and Themes on Social Media

### Use of Animals: Pets or Props?
A central theme in Tony's content, and a point of controversy, is his use of animals, primarily ducks and chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
Tony insists these animals are his "pets" and reacts aggressively to suggestions they are "props" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. However, his actions, such as having a chicken "speak" sexually suggestive lines or dressing a duck in lingerie, lead viewers to question this distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. The nature of these interactions also raises questions about the [[impact_of_fictional_influencers_on_audiences | impact of fictional influencers on audiences]], as the animals are given human-like attributes and dialogue.

### Pranks and Family Involvement

These pranks often seem staged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:00">[28:16:00]</a>. Characters like his mother are portrayed as highly vulgar and reactive to his antics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:00">[27:48:00]</a>. His sister has also been a target of his pranks, including being left adrift on a boat with a chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:00">[29:25:00]</a>.

### Controversial Content
Tony's content often pushes boundaries, featuring nudity or suggestive themes (e.g., being naked in a grocery store aisle, implying sexual acts with animals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>. He also uses explicit language and offensive terms in his captions and dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

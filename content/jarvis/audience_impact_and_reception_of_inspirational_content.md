From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Darman, a content creator and businessman, produces inspirational content in the form of stories that aim to teach a moral lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His videos have garnered an audience in the tens of millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

While these videos are intended to mean well, they often come across as "Instagram inspirational meme come to life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A consistent formula is followed: someone has a dream, someone crushes that dream, and the person who crushed the dream "instantly regrets it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This immediate reversal of character is a recurring element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Criticisms of Content and its [[audience_influence_on_content_creation | Audience Influence]]

Despite their popularity, Darman's videos face criticism regarding their effectiveness and [[influence_of_sensational_content_on_viewer_engagement | impact of sensational content]].

### "Son Demands a PlayStation 5"

This video features a moral about valuing what one has. However, the methods used to convey this message have been questioned:
*   **Shaming** Shaming a child into finishing food can lead to an unhealthy relationship with food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Charity for Reward** The act of giving is rewarded with a PlayStation 5, which suggests that altruism necessitates a tangible reward rather than being an intrinsic good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Good deeds should not be done merely for a prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Manufactured Empathy** The story creates a backstory for the mother, revealing she was homeless, to make the son's realization more intense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. However, empathy for someone's hardship should not require a shared personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Stereotypes and Missed Opportunities** The video depicts homeless people using stereotypes without offering educational resources about the unhoused or the root causes of their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. An opportunity to provide helpful information, such as how the mother went from "rags to riches," is missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### "Mom Accuses Her Son's Black Friend of Stealing"

This video aims to address racial prejudice, but its approach is problematic:
*   **Unrealistic Character Change** The prejudiced mother's immediate and complete transformation from racist to tolerant upon discovering the friend is wealthy and gets good grades is highly unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Real change typically requires a longer period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   **Superficial Resolution** The video suggests that racism can be overcome simply by having a Black friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, and that the mother's racism is dispelled by the friend's wealth and academic success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

### "Lady Calls Cop on a Black Mom with a White Kid"

This video centers on a woman confronting an interracial adoptive family:
*   **Lack of Realism** The story is criticized for not reflecting the real experiences of adopted children or families who do not visibly resemble each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. The aggressive and persistent questioning by the antagonist is deemed unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Insulting to [[audience_engagement_and_internet_humor | Audience]]** The video's justification for the adoption, involving a dying friend, is seen as unnecessary and insulting to the audience's intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. Adoption does not require such elaborate justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   **Diluted Message** The stories are overly dramatized, which dilutes any intended point and makes them unrelatable to real-world situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. This approach plays on emotions but is unlikely to motivate genuine change in those who need their opinions swayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

### Overall [[impact_of_fictional_influencers_on_audiences | Impact]]

The formulaic "complete reversal" at the end of each video is unrealistic and does not align with how people typically change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. While the videos are popular, their approach can feel like "toxic positivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. Better ways exist to share these stories, such as by directly showcasing positive examples and increasing representation, rather than centering them around proving a prejudiced person wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

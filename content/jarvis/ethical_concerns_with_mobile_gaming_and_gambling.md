Mobile games, particularly those incorporating gambling mechanics, raise significant ethical concerns regarding their design, marketing, and impact on users. The game *Coin Master* serves as a prominent example, highlighting issues such as misleading advertising, exploitative monetization, and potentially manipulative game design.

## Misleading Advertising and Celebrity Endorsements
*Coin Master* is widely known for its extensive advertising campaigns featuring numerous celebrities [00:01:05]. These ads often portray the game experience as something far removed from its actual gameplay.

Key examples of celebrity involvement:
*   [[misleading_mobile_game_ads|Misleading mobile game ads]] for *Coin Master* have featured Kris Jenner showing up at someone's house to "extort" them for in-game currency [00:01:11].
*   Other celebrities in ads include Khloe Kardashian, Morgz, Terry Crews, Jennifer Lopez, and The Real Housewives [00:01:24, 00:01:30, 00:01:40, 00:03:34].
*   The rap duo Rae Sremmurd even uploaded a *Coin Master* battle to their official YouTube channel [00:06:03, 00:07:38].
*   Ads suggest the game is "more than just a game" or involves "actual war," which is not representative of the real gameplay [00:03:21, 00:04:49].
*   The use of celebrities, particularly in scenarios where they appear to be "accosting random civilians for coins," creates a fabricated and dramatic impression of the game [00:03:34, 00:04:32].

Despite the star power, these celebrities could easily afford the game's in-game purchases, making their struggle for coins in the ads seem disingenuous [00:04:37, 00:04:43].

## Gambling Mechanics and Exploitative Design
*Coin Master* operates primarily as a simulated slot machine with a cartoonish art style, designed to encourage continuous spending [00:08:40, 00:13:43, 00:20:27, 00:20:42].

Key design elements that raise ethical flags:
*   **Linear Progression and Lack of Choices** The game's progression is entirely linear, offering no real choices or skill-based gameplay; players simply buy the next available upgrade [00:09:51, 00:17:49].
*   **Reliance on Slot Machine** Money is primarily acquired by spinning a slot machine [00:10:04]. Players get five free spins per day, but quickly run out, leading to prompts for [[monetization_and_microtransactions_in_mobile_games|microtransactions]] [00:10:27, 00:10:31].
*   **High Cost of In-Game Currency** Players can purchase large amounts of in-game currency; for example, 65 million coins can cost $400 [00:10:58].
*   **Manipulative Winning Patterns** The game initially gives players a sense of constant winning and being a "lucky duck," but then abruptly halts progress by running out of spins or requiring expensive repairs, pushing users towards purchases [00:11:13, 00:12:11, 00:12:39, 00:12:53, 00:13:28, 00:13:34].
*   **Simulated Multiplayer Interactions** While presented as a multiplayer game where players raid each other's villages, there is no proof that the "raiding" opponents are real people [00:16:35, 00:16:49, 00:16:52]. The "players" who attack villages often have common or unusual first names and use professionally lit stock photos as avatars, suggesting they may be fake accounts [00:14:27, 00:15:05, 00:15:27, 00:15:30, 00:15:40, 00:15:51]. This raises concerns about [[privacy_and_data_protection_in_mobile_gaming|privacy and data protection in mobile gaming]] and the potential for [[ethics_of_using_technology_for_social_manipulation|social manipulation]].
*   **Constant Notifications** The game employs aggressive notification strategies and "gifts" (free spins, coins) to keep users engaged and encourage them to return, fostering a habit [00:18:26, 00:19:52].
*   **No Real Game Elements** Critiques highlight that *Coin Master* lacks challenge, skill, or genuine choice, making it more akin to a gambling app than a traditional game [00:17:09, 00:17:49, 00:21:55]. It is designed to be a "gambling addiction" generator [00:18:15].

## Corporate Interests and Ethical Implications
The ownership and investment structure of *Coin Master* further illuminate its profit-driven design. The game was created by Moon Active, an Israeli game studio [00:08:14]. A top investor in *Coin Master* is Gigi Levi Weiss, the CEO of an online casino company [00:21:02]. This connection suggests a vested interest in "building a harmful habit" through the game's mechanics [00:21:13].

The overall design strips away the "soul" of a game, reducing it to its "raw most money-making qualities" [00:22:24, 00:22:12]. This approach raises questions about the [[importance_of_maintaining_ethical_boundaries_in_tech_innovation|ethical boundaries in tech innovation]], especially when the product resembles a gambling platform disguised as a casual mobile game.

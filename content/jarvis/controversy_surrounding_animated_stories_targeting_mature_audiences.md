YouTube has been a platform for various content, including animated story channels. These channels have frequently been subjected to [[critique_of_animated_story_channels|criticism]] due to their content and practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Historical Criticism and Drama
The channels have often been labeled as "dumb" and have become a "laughing stock on YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. In recent times, a significant channel disappeared without explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### My Story Animated
[[critique_on_my_story_animated|My Story Animated]], now considered the "de facto king of [[sensationalism_in_animated_stories|sensationalist animated stories]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, entered into a conflict with YouTuber Jay. Jay had created a reaction video to one of their animated stories. My Story Animated demanded he take down the video, threatening his channel if he didn't comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Their communication to Jay and the public was criticized for sounding as if written by an eighth-grader, comparing themselves to major franchises like *Game of Thrones*, *Death Note*, and *Avatar: The Last Airbender* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. They initially posted a lengthy message, then deleted it for being "too long" before releasing a shorter statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

My Story Animated asserted their right to deny anyone from using their videos, claiming they have the same rights as "any big studio or franchise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This stance ignores the concept of fair use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. They also contradicted previous statements where they explicitly allowed any YouTuber to make reaction videos without approval, stating, "we'll allow any youtuber to make them freely" and "we also love to watch them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

It is speculated that this change in policy stems from declining views and the general decline of the "animated story game," leading these channels to act out of paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## "True Stories" and Gross-Out Content
Another emerging channel, "True Stories," claims to create "animated stories for mature audiences intended to promote critical thinking and moral reasoning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. However, their content often features "gross ass content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

One example is their video titled "My Mother Loves My Cream," which explicitly depicts a mother using her son's "cream" on her face for skin benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The speaker acknowledges that blurring the word "cream" in a previous video ironically led more people to search for and view the "True Stories" video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### "I'm a Breastfed Adult" - Targeting a Content Creator
"True Stories" produced a video titled "I'm a Breastfed Adult," featuring an animated character named "Jarvis" with a similar haircut and appearance to the content creator discussing these channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The video depicts "Jarvis" as an adult who cannot live without breast milk, presenting a "gross story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Key elements of the "I'm a Breastfed Adult" narrative:
*   "Jarvis" describes his mother's breast milk having different "flavor profiles" on each side, like banana and chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   He continues breastfeeding into elementary school, with his mother reportedly bringing his younger brother to school to feed him in the classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   The story claims he continued to be nursed through middle school, with staff providing a private room for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   In college, his older sister Amanda pumps milk for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   "Jarvis" asks his long-term girlfriend, Janelle, to breastfeed him after they have a baby, using "anti-dairy propaganda" to justify his preference for human milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   The video concludes with claims that breast milk is the "perfect food for growing humans" nutritionally, immunologically, and psychologically, implying it is for adults, not just babies, without factual backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

## Conclusion
The content creator notes that "True Stories" likely produces these videos for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Despite the absurdity, the channel does not appear to be a parody, and its videos feature the same [[sensationalism_in_animated_stories|sensationalist]], gross content as other similar channels, without any genuine commentary or [[critique_of_fake_animated_stories|critique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. The speaker urges viewers not to support such channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

> [!INFO] Factual Discrepancy
> The video "I'm a Breastfed Adult" contains claims that breast milk is nutritionally, immunologically, and psychologically perfect for "growing humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. This statement is misleading as breast milk is primarily beneficial for infants, not adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

Snapchat, once a prominent social media application known for its ephemeral photos and videos, has seen a significant shift in its identity, largely influenced by its "Discover" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>. The overall [[the_decline_of_snapchat | decline of Snapchat]] is evident, with many users, including celebrities like [[impact_of_kylie_jenner_on_snapchats_business | Kylie Jenner]], no longer actively using the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. This decline was notably impacted by a tweet from [[impact_of_kylie_jenner_on_snapchats_business | Kylie Jenner]] that wiped out over a billion dollars in value for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

Many of Snapchat's original features, such as disappearing photos, wacky face filters, and "stories," were subsequently adopted by other apps, most notably [[history_and_evolution_of_instagram | Instagram]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. This appropriation occurred after Snapchat reportedly refused an acquisition offer from Mark Zuckerberg, leading to [[history_and_evolution_of_instagram | Instagram]] replicating its popular features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. Amidst this competition, especially with [[influence_of_apps_like_tiktok_on_instagram | TikTok]], Snapchat Discover emerged as one of the platform's few unique features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:46">[02:04:46]</a>.

## Discover's Initial Vision

When Snapchat Discover was first introduced, it aimed to garner respect by partnering with major media companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:30">[03:51:30]</a>. Early collaborations included reputable brands like National Geographic, ESPN, and CNN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:54">[04:03:54]</a>. The intent was for Discover to be a platform for high-quality, curated content from established publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:30">[03:51:30]</a>.

## Shift to Clickbait and Low-Quality Content

Over time, Snapchat Discover has transformed into a "magical place where you don't discover anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:55">[02:22:55]</a>. It is now characterized by "the worst clickbait known to man," often featuring sensationalized headlines and content that attacks the senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>. The content is eclectic and lacks a specific demographic, ranging from serious topics like coronavirus evaluations to frivolous "kissing tips" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:09">[02:44:09]</a>.

Despite employing leading experts in computer vision and machine learning for features like face filters, much of the Discover content is "repurposed content from elsewhere on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:39">[04:58:39]</a>. It is often reformatted poorly, with videos not properly reframed for the vertical Snapchat format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:39">[05:54:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:28">[07:21:28]</a>.

### Examples of Low-Quality Content

*   **"Slick Fades"**: A channel dedicated to haircuts that often involves drawing outlines for the cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   **"Phony Texts"**: A low-effort series featuring fake iMessage conversations between "fake people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:15">[12:17:15]</a>. These "stories" are just text exchanges, often with absurd or problematic narratives like a man harassing a woman from work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:25">[12:23:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:20">[14:41:20]</a>.
*   **The Dobre Brothers**: Influencers with a Snapchat show who famously claim to "live life like there's no tomorrow," which is ironic given their content often features destructive pranks, such as freezing a MacBook in ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:48">[05:57:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:08">[06:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:35">[06:50:35]</a>. These pranks are often poorly executed and raise questions about the destruction of personal property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

## Advertising Strategy

Snapchat's primary method for monetizing Discover content is through ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:47">[11:11:47]</a>. These advertisements are described as "frequent and just like haphazardly strewn about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:43">[10:20:43]</a>. Because the content itself is often short and lacks natural pauses, ads are inserted arbitrarily, interrupting the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:07">[10:27:07]</a>.

## Identity Crisis

The current state of Snapchat Discover has contributed to the app's loss of identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:56">[17:23:56]</a>. It now resembles a "BuzzFeed homepage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:43">[17:29:43]</a> rather than the platform once favored for sharing ephemeral memories with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:04">[17:32:04]</a>.

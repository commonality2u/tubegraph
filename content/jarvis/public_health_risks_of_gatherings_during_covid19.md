A new strain of [[FOMO and social media influence on youth behaviors | FOMO]], dubbed "Foam-C" (fear of missing clout), has been identified as a pandemic affecting children everywhere, causing them to attend wild parties [00:00:10]. Many young YouTubers and influencers have been unable to stop partying, leading to concerns about public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic [00:00:26].

## Influencer Parties and Lack of Responsibility
Many [[impact of quarantine on celebrities | influencers]] have struggled to stay home during the pandemic [00:00:34]. Their continued [[influencer_parties_during_the_pandemic | partying]] has been criticized for disregard of public health guidelines.

### Jake Paul's Gatherings
Jake Paul, a prominent YouTuber, hosted numerous events at his mansion in California [00:03:17]. Footage from these parties showed guests precariously dangling from an excavator, with no one wearing masks or [[digital_connections_and_social_distancing | social distancing]] [00:03:22]. Despite being accused of putting many people at risk, Paul had previously tweeted about personal growth and learning [00:01:31]. One creator who attended Jake Paul's party, Tanner Fox, subsequently tested positive for coronavirus [00:05:10]. In a call discussing the positive test, Paul and others appeared to laugh and not take the situation seriously, with someone in the background explicitly stating, "we don't care" [00:05:16].

### Rise of Creator Houses
Creator houses, predominantly featuring [[concerns_about_tiktok_content_and_platform_safety | TikTok creators]], have become significant perpetrators of large gatherings [00:06:07]. These include:
*   Hype House [00:06:12]
*   Sway House [00:06:13]
*   Alpha House [00:06:45]

Alpha House, a new creator house launched during the pandemic, reportedly held parties almost every night, with one event hosting approximately 150 people [00:07:07]. These houses are often composed of 17- and 18-year-old [[impact of quarantine on celebrities | influencers]] [00:07:36].

The Hype House has been particularly notorious for its quarantine parties, where attendees often do not wear masks [00:08:51]. Prominent figures like Emma Chamberlain, James Charles, and the D'Amelio sisters were reportedly present at such gatherings [00:08:40].

## Influencers' Justifications and Public Perception
Many [[impact of quarantine on celebrities | influencers]] offer excuses for their continued [[influencer_parties_during_the_pandemic | partying]], with the most common being that it is part of their job [00:09:04]. Thomas Petrou, a founder of Hype House, stated that their work involves entertaining people and living in groups, suggesting they "can't put our entire lives on hold for a year and not make any money" [00:09:24]. Critics argue this presents a false dilemma between large gatherings and financial ruin, especially when content could be created within their co-habiting groups [00:09:44].

### The Nelk Boys
The Nelk Boys, a Canadian group known for pranks, have been traveling and hosting parties across the country during the pandemic [00:11:55]. They even staged protests against the closure of gyms, equating it to other serious social movements [00:12:15]. Their videos often make light of serious issues and contain offensive humor [00:14:02].

### Bryce Hall's 21st Birthday
Bryce Hall of Sway House held a large 21st birthday celebration despite ongoing criticism of [[influencer_parties_during_the_pandemic | influencer parties]] [00:17:11]. The event featured male strippers dressed as cops, and actual police eventually showed up [00:18:17]. Hall's brand emphasizes authenticity and not caring about consequences, which extends to his party behavior [00:17:23]. He also used the party to promote his birthday merchandise [00:19:16].

## Consequences and Reactions
Influencers often apologize for attending parties to "save face" due to public backlash, but then continue to attend similar events [00:15:48]. A 25-year-old creator noted that when they are at these parties, "it's like COVID isn't a thing" [00:16:03].

While some, like Dixie D'Amelio, have publicly stated that people should not be going to these parties, this often comes after their own celebrations [00:16:24].

Local authorities have attempted to intervene; the Mayor of Los Angeles, for example, threatened to cut off water and power to creator houses that continued to host large gatherings [00:20:22]. Bryce Hall's power was eventually shut off, to which he responded, "we deserve it, it is illegal" [00:20:44]. However, he then celebrated not having contracted coronavirus, missing the larger point about the public health risk of the gatherings themselves, regardless of individual infection status [00:20:59].

The core issue remains that many [[impact of quarantine on celebrities | influencers]], despite knowing the risks and legal implications, continue to host or attend these gatherings, driven by the need to maintain their "reality show" brand and sell merchandise [00:19:39]. The gatherings pose a significant public health risk due to the lack of [[digital_connections_and_social_distancing | social distancing]] and mask-wearing [00:20:09].

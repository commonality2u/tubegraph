## About Team Trees
[[team_seas_initiative | Team Trees]] was started by content creators MrBeast and Mark Rober <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. They had been working on this project for several months prior to the video's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. The primary goal of the initiative is to plant 20 million trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

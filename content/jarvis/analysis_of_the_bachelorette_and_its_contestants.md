## Overview of The Bachelorette
*The Bachelorette* is described as a marriage game show where participants aim to find true love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">00:24:00</a>. It is essentially the same as [[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]], but with the genders swapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">00:00:36</a>. The format involves 30 "carefully selected copies of exactly the same person" competing for the love of someone they've known for approximately nine weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">00:00:44</a>.

The show has a "symbiotic relationship" with [[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]], where a non-winner from one show may go on to become the lead of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">00:01:11</a>.

Hannah B is characterized as a very genuine and cheerful person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">00:02:05</a>. Her previous season on [[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]] ended with her heart being broken by Colton, who introduced her to his family early before eliminating her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">00:02:14</a>. This season was presented as Hannah's "shot at love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">00:02:21</a>.

## Contestant Pool and Stereotypes

The show is known for its "cringy introductions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">00:02:51</a>.

#### Luke P: The Season's Villain
Luke P, despite being the eventual winner, received little screen time compared to the season's "villain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">00:06:05</a>. Luke P is described as a "five-nine Bible study leader with an anger management problem" and "big Napoleon energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">00:06:38</a>. He was often compared to a "bitmoji" in appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">00:06:49</a>. He made it to the final four despite being "super manipulative and awful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">00:07:02</a>.

Key instances of Luke P's problematic behavior:
*   During a rugby game in Rhode Island, Luke P randomly bodyslammed another contestant (Luke S), who did not have the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">00:08:10</a>. He then tried to claim he was defending himself, and Hannah B surprisingly took his side, eliminating Luke S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">00:08:50</a>.
*   When Hannah B tried to eliminate him, he refused to respect her wishes and walked back onto the set, claiming Hannah still wanted him there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">00:09:03</a>. This was implied to be allowed by producers for drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">00:09:08</a>.
*   He put baloney in another contestant's lap, a very strange act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">00:09:18</a>. His easy aggravation led to other contestants trolling him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">00:09:30</a>.
*   During the Fantasy Suites, Luke P told Hannah B she shouldn't sleep with any of the other guys, claiming it's "not what a good Christian girl would do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">00:10:09</a>. He threatened to go home if she had been sexually intimate with anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">00:10:18</a>. Hannah B realized she didn't like his controlling behavior and tried to eliminate him again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">00:10:28</a>.
*   He again refused to leave, prompting Hannah B to famously state that she and Peter "gonna windmill so twice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">00:10:51</a>, which caused a bar audience to erupt in applause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">00:11:04</a>.
*   Luke P returned once more, showing up with an engagement ring and acting like a "serial killer," expressing that he still loved Hannah despite being rejected multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">00:11:51</a>. He continued to refuse to leave until other male contestants stepped in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">00:13:52</a>.
*   During a post-show Q&A with Chris Harrison, he claimed he wouldn't change a thing and that he never intended to control a woman, while simultaneously stating a man is "supposed to lead and guide the woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">00:15:25</a>. The other contestants then "destroyed" Luke P during this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">00:15:28</a>.

#### Jed: The Musician and Winner
Jed, a "quote-unquote musician slash Megamind," was the eventual winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">00:16:32</a>. He constantly talked about being a musician and songwriter, and sang poorly at every opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">00:18:17</a>.

Crucially, Jed admitted to Hannah B that he initially came on the show for his music career, although he claimed he then "fell in love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">00:19:21</a>. Despite this, everyone, including his family, repeatedly told Hannah B that Jed was only on the show for his music career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">00:19:41</a>. His family even expressed doubt that he would be ready for marriage due to his focus on music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">00:20:06</a>. Hannah's family also expressed concerns about Jed, specifically regarding how he would make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">00:20:43</a>. His major accomplishment as a musician was revealed to be a dog food jingle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">00:21:05</a>.

Jed proposed to Hannah B with a song, which was described as "the cringiest thing in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">00:21:49</a>.

Post-show revelations about Jed:
*   A People magazine article came out from someone claiming to be Jed's girlfriend, detailing how he got on the show for his music career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">00:22:28</a>.
*   She claimed he ghosted her despite their "very serious relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">00:22:38</a>.
*   Jed claimed they weren't boyfriend-girlfriend but admitted they went on multiple trips, he met her family, her parents bought them a trip to the Bahamas, and he told her he loved her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">00:23:10</a>.
*   He had been bragging to friends that he won the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">00:23:53</a>.
*   He partied with random models who showed up at his hotel room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">00:24:04</a>.
*   Jed broke up with his girlfriend before the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">00:24:14</a>.
*   During a live show, the lack of applause for Jed upon his entrance was noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">00:24:33</a>.

## [[critique_of_the_bachelor_as_a_television_show | Critique of The Bachelorette as a Television Show]]
The show is perceived as being "dumb" and becoming "more and more ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">00:01:38</a>. It likes to pretend it's helping people find love but acts more like a typical reality show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">00:25:27</a>. It's considered more dishonest than shows like *Real Housewives* because it tries to present itself as a "polished thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">00:25:35</a>.

### [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | Role of Producers and Editing]]
The [[role of producers and editing in The Bachelor | show's producers]] appear to condone and even facilitate toxic behavior for drama, as seen with Luke P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">00:09:08</a>. The show subjected Hannah B to "ridiculous and emotionally manipulative situations" for the sake of being "the most dramatic season yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">00:14:31</a>. The show is criticized for fixating on Luke P's toxic behavior for an entire season, indicating a "lacking in self-awareness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">00:26:05</a>. Towards the end of the season, the show backtracked on its initial decisions and "lay into Luke P and like lay into Jed for for being like awful people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">00:26:18</a>.

### [[cultural_impact_and_fan_community_of_the_bachelor | Cultural Impact and Fan Community]]
The show is considered fun to watch mostly due to the "community around the show and the content around the show" rather than the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">00:25:52</a>. When Hannah B eliminated Luke P with her "windmill" comment, the bar the presenter was in "erupted into applause" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">00:11:04</a>, and people even wore "windmill merch" at a live show afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">00:11:07</a>.

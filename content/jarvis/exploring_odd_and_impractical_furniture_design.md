"House Design 77" is a popular [[analyzing_tiktok_home_design_videos | TikTok account]] known for creating bizarre and often dangerous interior designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The videos, characterized by their high production quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, showcase highly impractical and sometimes terrifying room concepts.

## Recurring Design Flaws and Elements

The designs frequently feature elements that defy practicality, safety, and common sense, often highlighted with humorous commentary.

### The "Eight Kids" Room
One notable design is a bedroom designed for multiple children, which incorporates several disturbing features:
*   **Minimal Fasteners** The bunk beds are presented as secured to the ceiling but appear to be entirely pointless, relying on only one visible screw for the entire structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Hospital Aesthetic** The beds resemble the ends of hospital beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Guillotine Fan** A fan mechanism descends from the ceiling directly above the bed, posing a "guillotine" like danger to children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Morgue-like Beds** The beds slide out from the wall in a manner reminiscent of morgue drawers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, earning the design the nickname "reverse morgue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **"Infinity Kids" Concept** The room suggests an "infinite" capacity for children or bedrooms, despite its cramped design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Sudden Appearances** Animated figures of children in the videos move in an "uncanny valley" way, often sliding into place unnaturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Tiger Training Cage** A large cage containing a tiger can drop from the ceiling, apparently for children's "training" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Limited Usable Space** After all the furniture and oddities are installed, there is very little open space in the room for daily activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Dystopian Overtones** The room's design and crowded nature evoke comparisons to dystopian scenarios like "Squid Game" or "Battle Royale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### "Popular Toilet Design"
Another viral video, with 60 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, features a "popular toilet design" that starts by showing an angry man showering and a woman with bad posture on the toilet, suggesting a need for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Unusual Construction Methods** Walls are depicted as being lifted up to allow for internal construction, which is not how real construction works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
*   **Simultaneous Activities** The redesign aims to allow multiple activities, such as showering and using the toilet, to happen concurrently and "in private" within a small space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### Other [[bizarre_and_impractical_diy_trends | Bizarre and Impractical DIY Trends]]
The series also features:
*   **Floating Washing Machine** A washing machine is placed on a shelf, supposedly for easier cleaning underneath, but making it harder to move or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, leading to the suggestion of a "flying washing machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   **Aquarium with Alligator** A design includes an aquarium, but bafflingly, an alligator is introduced separately, then shown being fought by a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. This scenario is humorously interpreted as an example of "weaponized incompetence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
*   **Fold-out Balcony** A concept for a balcony that folds out from a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

The channel's actual business is a beauty store, selling products like mini projectors, home faces, lips, and eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

The internet has become a "very strange place" where brands frequently engage in online interactions, sometimes adopting human-like personas on platforms like Twitter and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This phenomenon, often termed "Brand Twitter," has led to a peculiar "dystopia" where companies, such as Wendy's and Burger King, tweet as if they are people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. While previously becoming somewhat repetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, new and interesting developments can still emerge in the realm of [[corporate_humor_and_communication_on_social_media_platforms | corporate humor and communication on social media platforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The Target vs. Walmart "War" on TikTok and Twitter

A recent escalation of intercompany rivalry manifested as a "war" between two billion-dollar department store corporations, Target and Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This conflict, predominantly on TikTok, originated over shopping carts and expanded to include threats, bullying, theft, and corporate espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Origin and Escalation

The "war" began with a lone Target employee who found a Walmart shopping cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Instead of ignoring it, the employee created a viral TikTok video, declaring the cart a "hostage" and issuing a 24-hour ultimatum to Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This initial video featured the Target employee jokingly threatening the Walmart cart with a Target cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The video quickly went viral, prompting a follow-up continuing the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Official Brand Involvement

Seeing the virality, Walmart's marketing team capitalized on the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Walmart responded with its own TikTok video, featuring a "Target ball" (one of the large red balls outside Target stores) wearing a Walmart jacket and a "Surge" name tag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This response was considered "hilarious" and a "solid nine out of ten" in its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Target then responded with an "arms race" mentality to continue the viral moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Their TikTok featured a "war general ball" (a Target ball with animated eyes and mouth) assembling "Avengers" of Target's corporate partners, including "Starbucks Ranger," "Ulta Ranger," and "Disney Ranger," to take back "what is ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This official Target account video, with its unsettling visual style, drew comments from other brands like "Pizza Hut Express Ranger is standing by," seeking to join the viral moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Unsettlingly, some users reacted as if Target was a small, up-and-coming creator rather than a multi-billion dollar corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Employee-Led Rivalry and Corporate Espionage

Beyond the official brand accounts, individual employees from both companies significantly contributed to the "war." Colton, a Walmart employee, became a prominent figure, creating TikToks where he "corrall[ed] around his army of shopping carts like he's a war general slash the night king" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Another Walmart employee, "Burnt Bacon 5631," was hailed as a hero for "rescuing" a Walmart cart from Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Many other individuals also participated in rescuing carts, indicating a "nationwide epidemic" of "hostage-taking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

The original Target employee, Jaden, continued the narrative with cinematic videos, including one where he appeared to be "stricken with visions" of carts being returned, suggesting his prisoner cart had escaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

The rivalry escalated to "corporate espionage" when Colton "personally [stole] a cart from Target" and asked viewers to choose a side: "red or blue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This act, while "for sure illegal," was framed as part of the brand marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Target's official response to this was a TikTok insinuating that the "stolen" Walmart cart was a "double agent" and a "Trojan horse" used to infiltrate Walmart and gather "hundreds of company secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

The conflict even took a "gruesome turn" with a video depicting Walmart employees "brutalizing a poor Target cart," prompting a fictional "call to arms" for Target employees across the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Other companies, typically neutral, were "pulled into the fray," such as Home Depot taking Walmart's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, and Amazon attempting to get involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

### The Cold War Era and Continued Engagement

Eventually, tensions cooled, entering a "cold war era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. However, the rivalry persisted, even crossing over with other viral trends like the "devious licks" trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. The feud also resurfaced on Twitter, with official accounts engaging in direct banter, such as Target tweeting "because we're not walmart" in response to a prompt, and Walmart replying with a Mariah Carey "why you so obsessed with me" meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## Analysis of Engagement Strategies

The Target vs. Walmart "war" exemplifies [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing strategies and viral trends in social media]]. This event, likely not a pre-planned grand marketing scheme, began with "a few random employees" and then saw the companies capitalize on already viral TikToks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

The [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | impact of social media engagements by brands]] is evident in the attention generated. Brands are willing to pay "big money to get anything close to this type of attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. For the employees involved, this presented an opportunity to gain "TikTok clout" and followers through their personal accounts, potentially leading to future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. However, it raises questions about whether these employees are compensated for their significant contributions to their companies' free advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

This type of [[audience_engagement_and_internet_humor | audience engagement and internet humor]] is generally "mostly harmless," as long as it's remembered that "these corporations are profiting off of our attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

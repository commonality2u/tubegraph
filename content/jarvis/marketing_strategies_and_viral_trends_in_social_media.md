The internet, particularly platforms like TikTok and Twitter, has become a dynamic arena for [[The role of brands in social media | brands]] to engage in [[Impact of social media engagements by brands | social media engagement]] and capitalize on [[Marketing strategies involving humor and memes | viral trends]]. This environment has led to a unique "war" between corporate giants, initiated not by official marketing departments, but by individual employees, demonstrating how [[Employeedriven social media trends and brand capitalisation | employee-driven social media trends can lead to brand capitalization]].

## The Genesis of the "War"
The current "war" between multi-billion dollar department store corporations Target and Walmart began over shopping carts on TikTok and Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It has escalated to include fictional threats, bullying, theft, and corporate espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This saga exemplifies how modern [[Marketing strategies involving humor and memes | marketing schemes]] can exploit even undervalued employees for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

The conflict's humble beginnings trace back to a lone Target employee named Jaden, who found a Walmart shopping cart and created a viral TikTok, holding the cart "hostage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This initial video, featuring the employee making a playful threat, quickly went viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. A follow-up TikTok continued the narrative, showing the cart "guarded behind bars" (cart corrals) and "screaming for help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Brand Involvement and Capitalization
Upon recognizing the viral potential of Jaden's TikToks, Walmart's marketing team seized the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. They responded with their own humorous TikTok, featuring a Target ball (the red spheres outside Target stores) wearing a Walmart jacket and a name tag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This response was lauded as a "solid nine out of ten" for its effectiveness in continuing the viral moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Target then retaliated, with its official account posting a video where a "war general ball" from Target (presumably the same type of red sphere) assembled "Avengers" of its corporate partners, including Starbucks, Ulta, Disney, and Apple rangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This prompted other [[The role of brands in social media | brands]] to jump into the comments section, attempting to insert themselves into the popular moment, such as "Pizza Hut Express Ranger" offering assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

Interestingly, many TikTok users responded to Target's official account as if it were a small, up-and-coming creator, rather than a multi-billion dollar corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This highlights how successfully the [[The role of brands in social media | brands]] adopted a persona that resonated with the platform's user base.

## Escalation and "Warfare"
The "war" intensified with more employees participating. Colton, a Walmart employee known as "colton runs 2003," became a prominent figure, commanding an "army of shopping carts" like a "war general" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Other Walmart employees, like "burnt bacon 5631," posted videos of themselves "rescuing" Walmart carts from Target locations, turning it into a "nationwide epidemic" of cart "hostage" situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:10:00]</a>.

Target's Jaden responded with a cinematic video implying the "rescued" Walmart cart was a double agent, a "Trojan horse" designed to steal company secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Later, a gruesome (fictional) turn occurred when Walmart employees were seen "brutalizing a poor target cart" on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:46]</a>. This, in turn, spurred a fictional "call to arms" among Target employees nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:08]</a>.

Neutral entities also found themselves drawn into the conflict. Home Depot, typically neutral, sided with Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:15:00]</a>. Even Amazon was depicted as stationed outside a Walmart base, though Walmart attempted to keep the feud contained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:37]</a>. The "devious licks" trend, where people filmed themselves stealing items, also crossed over into the "war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:57]</a>.

## Brand Twitter Revival
The "war" eventually extended back to Twitter, a platform previously known for "brand twitter" phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The official Walmart account tweeted, "okay but why should we follow you" to which Target replied, "because we're not walmart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:18]</a>. Walmart then used the Mariah Carey "why you so obsessed with me" meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This exchange demonstrated the return of [[Consumer behavior and brand interactions on social media | consumer behavior and brand interactions on social media]] in a recognizable "brand twitter" style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

## Impact and Reflection
This "war of the brands" wasn't a pre-planned [[Marketing strategies involving humor and memes | marketing scheme]] but an organic trend started by a few employees that [[The role of brands in social media | companies]] capitalized on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:26]</a>. It provided free advertising for the corporations, and thankfully, the employees involved were not fired, a common negative outcome in such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:38]</a>. While the corporations profited from this attention, employees like Jaden and Colton gained significant TikTok clout and followers, hopefully leading to future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:18:10]</a>.

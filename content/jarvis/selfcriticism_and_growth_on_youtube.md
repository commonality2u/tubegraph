From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The creator, Jarvis Johnson, often refers to himself as the "internet hater" who finds and critiques the "worst channels on YouTube" for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. However, he also describes himself as his "own worst critic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, using his personal history to illustrate the challenges and evolution of a content creator on the platform.

## Early Digital Footprint and Creative Attempts

Having grown up on the internet, Johnson has a "pretty big digital footprint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. His main YouTube channel, started in 2006 when he was 14, was originally named `vsympathyv` (after a Runescape account) and used to post Runescape videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. He quickly abandoned Runescape videos, stating that "abandoning things was kind of my brand back then" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

Subsequent early endeavors included:
*   **High School Musical 2 Dance Video (2007)** – A dance video made when he was 14, which he described as "the least compelling thing ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. He got defensive in the comments when it was uploaded due to audio/video offset, blaming YouTube instead of his own editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.
*   **"Get Down" Meme Video** – Uploaded two years later, featuring him in questionable attire, leading him to ask "who let me out of the house like this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   **"The Random Podcast" (2007)** – A short-lived podcast between three 14-year-olds that lasted five episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. This podcast included inappropriate humor, such as a segment where he expressed a desire to physically harm a child wearing Heelys and "feed them to hungry African children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.
*   **Rapping Videos** – Uploaded to Facebook, these featured him rapping in high school, which he now finds "so cringy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.
*   **Vine Videos** – He only made three Vine videos, including "banana nut," "that's my cue," and "that's my jam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.

## Evolution of [[the_ethics_of_comedy_and_criticism_online | Criticism]] and Growth

Johnson explicitly reflects on the ethical implications of his early content versus his current approach to [[the_ethics_of_comedy_and_criticism_online | criticism]]. He notes that making fun of a classmate in a video was bullying because it was "punching down" – making a joke at the expense of someone less powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. In contrast, when he [[criticism_of_lowquality_content_on_youtube_channels | critiques]] entities like Five-Minute Crafts, he feels comfortable doing so because they are a big company and not an oppressed group, making it not "punching down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>. He acknowledges that the joke about "African children" in his old podcast was also inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>.

He states that he is "not the same person" he was 11 or 12 years ago, hoping that people can grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.

## Current Challenges and Creator Identity

The channel recently hit 300,000 subscribers, marking significant [[discussion_about_youtube_channel_growth | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Despite this success, Johnson openly discusses his [[personal_struggles_with_imposter_syndrome_and_audience_expectations | imposter syndrome]] and audience expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>. He feels vulnerable and is "never really happy with anything" he puts out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.

Key challenges he faces include:
*   **Understanding his New Audience:** He doesn't know much about his large new audience or what they want, leading to a fear of disappointing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.
*   **[[personal_struggles_with_imposter_syndrome_and_audience_expectations | Imposter Syndrome]]:** He questions whether he deserves such a large audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>.
*   **Fear of Disappointing the Original Audience:** He worries about disappointing the "tech audience" that supported him before the channel's recent take-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>.

For Johnson, YouTube is a way to "experiment and grow" with his [[creator_identity_and_creative_direction_on_youtube | creativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. He emphasizes that "in order to grow, you have to try" and that it "can be scary to try something earnestly because of the fear of not being accepted, but it's necessary for growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. He concludes by stating that it doesn't really matter if he's the "worst channel on YouTube" because, regardless of a video's performance, there will always be another one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.

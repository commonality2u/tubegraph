Wilmer Valderrama served as the host of MTV's 2006 show, [[discussion_of_the_mtv_show_yo_momma | *Yo Momma*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. He was identified as "the dude from *That '70s Show*" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, with the show potentially serving as a post-*That '70s Show* project for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Host Persona and Image
Valderrama's presentation on [[discussion_of_the_mtv_show_yo_momma | *Yo Momma*]] reflected an effort to "completely recreate his image" following the success of *That '70s Show* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. He adopted a "cool guy" persona, consistently wearing leather jackets and jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The show's opening sequences, such as him exiting an Escalade with women fanning themselves, aimed to portray him as an "American heartthrob" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. At the time of filming, he appeared to be "on top of the world" and described as being in his "nirvana" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Hosting Style and Duties
Despite being the main host, Valderrama's direct involvement in the competition's mechanics seemed limited. He was noted for rarely delivering the rules, instead delegating this task to a co-presenter named Sam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. His role primarily involved introducing segments and the overall premise of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. His presence seemingly diminished after the first episode, leading to observations that he was merely a "selling point" who was then "barely even in it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

## Personal Life Context
The discussion around Valderrama's public image also touched upon his past dating history, specifically mentioning his relationships with Demi Lovato and Lindsay Lohan when they were 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This aspect of his "backstory" was cited as something he "should have rebranded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, and was jokingly referred to as "your mama's so old he's old enough to be your mom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

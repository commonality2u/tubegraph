The Netflix show *Love is Blind* is hosted by Nick Lachey and his wife, Vanessa Lachey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Despite their hosting role, they are only seen on screen for approximately three minutes throughout the entire series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Claims as "Marriage Experts"
Nick Lachey's background includes being in a boy band in 1998, 98Â°, and starring in a TV show with a different wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Despite this, the hosts are referred to as "marriage experts" or "marriage gurus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

At the beginning of the show, the "esteemed marriage scientists" deliver a "holier-than-thou monologue" critiquing modern society's focus on physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This message is seen as ironic given their "lifelong careers in television" and the show's focus on "conventionally attractive people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

### The "Experiment"
The Lacheys consistently refer to the show as "the experiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. They emphasize that the couples are getting engaged "without ever seeing each other a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The stated purpose of this "experiment" is to test "whether love is blind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

However, this framing is challenged:
*   Real-world examples like "actual blind people and arranged marriages" already exist, suggesting the premise is not novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   The show's rapid engagement timeline, demanding proposals in 10 days or less, suggests it should be called "Love is Swift" rather than focusing solely on the "blind" aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   The hosts make "pretty big claims about the experiment" despite not being scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. The show is criticized for lacking scientific rigor, with no control group, and no clearly defined independent or dependent variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   The hosts' statements are described as "random gibberish with total authority" that are not backed up, suggesting they "wouldn't stand up to peer review" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

After the couples meet in person and move into an apartment complex, Nick and Vanessa Lachey continue to make grand claims about the relationships, suggesting that if couples "make it through these tests," their marriages will be on "extremely solid ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.

In the final reunion, when asked if love can truly be blind, everyone raises their hand, which is presumed to be "to maintain a good relationship with the producers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:00">[22:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:00]</a>. The [[critique_of_reality_tv_and_its_portrayal_of_relationships | portrayal of relationships]] on the show, overseen by these hosts, is often seen as highly dramatic and manufactured.

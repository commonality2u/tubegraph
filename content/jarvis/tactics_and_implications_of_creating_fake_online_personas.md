Ethan Kaiser, described as "TikTok's titan of toxic tech," is a software engineer and entrepreneur known for posting viral videos on TikTok where he claims to "hack" social media and dating apps to gain fame and find love [00:00:26]. His methods often involve creating or projecting fake online personas and manipulating digital interactions, raising significant ethical concerns.

## "Tech Hacks" and Abusive Behavior

Kaiser's content often blurs the line between clever tech use and abusive behavior. One example involves using a girlfriend's Wi-Fi password to gain access to a router and remotely check connected devices. This allows him to determine if she is home or if other devices have connected, implying a method for tracking her movements or detecting infidelity [00:00:48].

This tactic is not a "tech hack" but rather abusive behavior, stalking, and a significant betrayal of trust and privacy [00:01:21]. It is deemed "creepy and weird" [00:02:26] and is comparable to going through someone's phone, with technology not making it any less invasive [00:02:11]. The speaker emphasizes that such actions would be problematic regardless of who performs them [00:01:47].

## Engineering Online Fame and Clout

Kaiser created an app designed to make it appear as though he has thousands of viewers on Instagram Live [00:11:36]. He used this [[impact_of_online_fame_and_popularity_on_content_creation | fake clout]] at a Miami beach club and a sold-out club to gain special treatment, such as entry to VIP sections [00:12:22].

This "clout" app effectively pretends to be Instagram Live, allowing him to walk around with his phone and "lie to people about who he is" [00:11:54]. The "perfect crime" involves starting relationships by lying about one's identity [00:12:01].

A key aspect of this fake persona is the programmed chat messages, which include about ten repeating phrases that paint a "saddest picture of all time" [00:13:31]. Examples include:
*   "Guess who my favorite creator is" [00:13:33]
*   "Have you ever heard of Ethan Kaiser, I hear he's a great creator" [00:13:38]
*   "Do you go live often" [00:14:44]
*   "I like what I'm seeing" [00:14:46]
*   "Would you ever go on a date with a viewer" [00:14:48]
*   "Will you adopt me" [00:14:50]

This application is described as a "screenshot with more steps" [00:14:00], essentially a camera view with a scrolling fake chat and a false viewer count [00:14:06]. The tactic works to some extent because people are not accustomed to others walking up to them and lying about their fame [00:14:23]. The speaker notes that it's "dystopian" and "sad" that he has to write these messages himself, highlighting the "odd optics" of the situation [00:14:55]. It also reveals his perception of what it's like to be a famous streamer [00:15:09].

The scale of the fake fame is considerable; Kaiser's app purports 45,000 live viewers [00:12:29]. For context, Drake, a major celebrity, only achieved around 75,000 concurrent viewers on Instagram Live after the Raptors won the NBA finals [00:15:40]. The expectation that someone with such high viewership would not be recognized in person is questioned [00:16:00].

## Manipulating Dating Apps with AI Personas

Kaiser also developed a method to "date 50,000 women in New York City" [00:18:17] by manipulating dating apps.

### Tactics:
*   **Data Collection:** He "reverse engineered all the major dating apps" to store 49,000 profiles in a database [00:19:19]. He also displays full names and phone numbers of matches, raising concerns about [[identity_threat_and_social_media_issues | privacy invasion]] [00:18:34].
*   **Mass Swiping:** He wrote a program to swipe right on all profiles, resulting in around 5,000 matches [00:19:04].
*   **AI Communication:** To speak to all 5,000 matches, he built an artificial intelligence "based on the personalities of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho and James Bond" [00:19:21].

### Implications and Ethical Concerns:
*   **Consent and Deception:** The use of AI to impersonate a human and the use of characters known for their dark traits (Patrick Bateman is a serial killer) for dating is deeply disturbing [00:20:15]. This is described as "ethically wrong" as the women would clearly not consent if they knew what was happening [00:23:01].
*   **Unsuitable Personas:** The choice of Bateman and Bond as AI personalities is questioned, as they are considered "the two least eligible bachelors possible" if the goal is to date women, especially compared to characters typically romanticized by women [00:19:39].
*   **Victim Blaming and Turing Test:** The speaker ironically notes that they "wouldn't want to date someone who failed the Turing test" [00:20:31] and raises new concerns about dating in a world with AI, such as asking if a date can solve a captcha [00:20:46].
*   **Long-term Consequences:** The speaker questions what happens when the manipulation is revealed, asking "what do you say to your grandkids when they ask how meemaw and pipa hooked up?" [00:23:20].
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** Despite the apparent success of these tactics in attracting attention, the speaker asserts that this behavior is "creepy," "morally gray at best," and not something to aspire to or admire [00:24:28]. The appeal of such methods is attributed to the difficulty of dating and the desire for love [00:23:53].

## Overall Impact and Ethical Stance

The creator of the video expresses that while some of the concepts Kaiser plays with are interesting, the implementation is problematic [00:11:20]. Kaiser's actions are consistently portrayed as "clownish" [00:10:21], "creepy" [00:24:44], and "toxic" [00:24:47]. The speaker suggests that Kaiser is aware his actions will be perceived as "toxic" but proceeds anyway [00:24:51].

The article highlights the broader [[ethics_of_using_technology_for_social_manipulation | ethics of using technology for social manipulation]] and [[ethics_of_blending_fiction_and_reality_on_social_media | blending fiction and reality on social media]]. It concludes by stating that people often "look past the ethics of things" when something promises a desired outcome [00:25:16]. The speaker emphasizes that the reason most people do not engage in such behaviors is not a lack of skill, but because it is "kind of a creepy thing to do" [00:24:28].

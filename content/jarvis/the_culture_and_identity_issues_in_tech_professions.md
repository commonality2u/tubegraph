From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The world of software engineering, while often presented with immense hype, carries certain cultural and identity challenges that prospective entrants should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The aim is to bring expectations back down to earth and offer a more realistic perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Unsolicited Tech Support and "Million-Dollar Ideas"

One common, albeit minor, annoyance for anyone associated with computers is the constant barrage of tech support questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Friends and family will assume you can fix their printer, even if your expertise lies in specific programming tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Beyond that, expect everyone you know to suddenly become an "entrepreneur" with a "million-dollar app idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. These ideas almost always require you to do all the work, with the promise of a small share in a hypothetical, often unrealistic, success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## The Toxic "Elite Club" Mentality

A significant issue in tech is when individuals define themselves by being a member of an "elite club" of programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This singular definition often leads to a toxic culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This phenomenon can be seen in other communities, like among gamers, where those who play on mobile are often deemed "not true gamers" compared to PC players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

In tech, you must prepare to have your validity constantly checked regarding various aspects of your technical identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This includes:
*   **Programming Language:** You might be criticized for coding in Python, with others claiming "true programmers code in C++," or even C, or machine code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Operating System:** Using a Mac might lead to comments like "real programmers use Linux" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Hardware:** Even your keyboard can be a point of contention, with mechanical keyboard users looking down on those with "chiclet keyboards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

This pervasive culture of gatekeeping and questioning others' legitimacy can be incredibly draining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Impact on Identity: Imposter Syndrome

Despite achievements like working on features used by millions, attending good schools, and receiving awards, individuals in tech often face online criticism questioning their status as a "real programmer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This constant invalidation can contribute to [[challenges_faced_by_software_engineers | impostor syndrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The culture is not always accommodating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. However, it's important to note that many wonderful companies and organizations do not exhibit these toxic behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Beyond the Perks: The Reality of Tech Jobs

Once you are a working engineer, even in a supportive organization, there are no guarantees you'll be working on exactly what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Business needs change rapidly, limiting complete agency over projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

The flashy perks often highlighted in the tech industry, such as free food and ping-pong tables, serve a business value for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. These perks are designed to keep employees in the office longer or foster dependence on the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Due to the "hedonic treadmill" effect, these perks quickly lose their luster and become the norm once basic needs are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

[[financial_uncertainties_in_tech_jobs | Pursuing a career in software engineering]] shouldn't be driven by trends or the expectation of quick riches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Most startups fail, and even at large companies, highly talented individuals might work on projects they are not excited about due to the high concentration of talent and limited opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## The Unavoidable Investment of Time and Effort

Becoming a software engineer requires significant upfront time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **University Programs:** Four-year university programs can be difficult and draining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. They might not fully expose students to the resources needed to be appealing to companies, making the job search challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Bootcamps:** While good for career changes and getting a foot in the door quickly, bootcamps still require a "very long tail of learning" that must be supported by an employer or done independently to further one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Many successful hobbyist programmers owe their success to dedicating extensive time outside of work or school to their craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This dedication, when aligned with market value, is a form of luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The speaker, for example, prioritized being a hobbyist over being just a student, spending countless hours on online classes, tutorials, and personal projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This was enjoyable because they loved making things with friends and learning together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Serving as a teaching assistant was a strategic move to improve programming interview skills and indulge a passion for teaching complex concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Why the Caution?

Despite the challenges, software engineering provided the speaker with an invaluable skill set and was instrumental in achieving financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. It remains one of the best career paths and can lead to meaningful friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. However, the speaker ultimately moved on from software engineering as a career, emphasizing that this is a normal and acceptable path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

The advice to *not* become a software engineer is akin to Jerry Seinfeld telling aspiring comedians not to pursue comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The underlying message is that for success in such a difficult field, one must genuinely love doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The only way to overcome the numerous hurdles is if you have [[the_role_of_passion_and_dedication_in_software_engineering | genuine passion]] and the market values what you love doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This alignment constitutes a "dream job," which one should pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

Ultimately, your life is yours to choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. If this perspective makes the field less attractive, remember that many other resources offer the opposite view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The key is to "follow a path, any path, until you get to a place that you feel like you don't like, and then change your direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Your primary job is to continually build yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

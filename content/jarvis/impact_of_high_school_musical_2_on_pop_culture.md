*High School Musical 2* is described as a "cinematic masterpiece" and a "work so transcendent that its magnificence has yet to be replicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. It is considered an improvement over the first movie, taking the "raw coal" and turning it into a "diamond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Its success was so significant that the sequel, *High School Musical 3*, was released in theaters, having "outgrown its humble Disney Channel beginnings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Despite subsequent efforts, the magic of *High School Musical 2* was never fully recreated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The [[Musical numbers and choreography in High School Musical 2 | songs]] from *High School Musical 2* are largely regarded as iconic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### "Work This Out"

### "Bet On It"
"Bet On It" is noted as the most "memed" song from the film in the 15 years since its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. The dramatic solo number featuring Troy interpretive dancing took six days to film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. The scene also includes infamous visual elements, such as "extremely green" grass that looks like a green screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a> and a notable moment with "the world's worst CG" reflection of Troy in a pond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

### "I Don't Dance"
The song "I Don't Dance," performed by Ryan and Chad, is highlighted for the "sexual tension" between the characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. The film's director, Kenny Ortega, who is gay, has discussed Ryan's character as being gay, acknowledging it was at a time when "the Disney Channel wasn't ready for that conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

## Character Development and Tropes

*High School Musical 2* introduces a "new game plus" approach, where characters seem to have "complete amnesia" regarding their arcs from the previous movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. This includes Sharpay, who despite her [[High School Musical movie plot and review | character arc]] in the first film, remains "hell-bent on ruining Gabriella's life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

Ryan Evans is noted as the "most underutilized member of the cast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, but his role becomes pivotal, especially during "I Don't Dance," where he "becomes the star of the movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a> and even takes on a "new Troy" persona, flirting with Gabriella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. The character of Chad is also highlighted for his significant dancing throughout the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Minor characters like Fulton, the general manager of Lava Springs, gain a moment of genuine empathy, as he is portrayed as a man trying to keep his job while taking orders from a teenager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. Zeke Baylor is celebrated as a "king" character, known for his culinary skills and relaxed attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

The film also features a cameo by Miley Cyrus due to a fan poll for Disney Channel stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>.

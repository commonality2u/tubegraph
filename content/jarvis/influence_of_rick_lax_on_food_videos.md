From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

Viral food videos, particularly those featuring outlandish and unhygienic cooking methods directly on countertops, are often linked to [[rick_lax_and_viral_content_creation | Rick Lax]] and his production company, [[rick_lax_and_viral_content_creation | Rick Lax Productions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. These videos, which include "ultimate nacho hack," "ultimate spaghetti trick," and other recipes prepared on kitchen counters, are designed for maximum views and generate significant online outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

## Discovery of the Connection

The connection between these "countertop cooking" videos and [[rick_lax_and_viral_content_creation | Rick Lax]] was made when it was observed that the "ultimate spaghetti trick" was posted by the [[rick_lax_and_viral_content_creation | Rick Lax]] page shortly after its original upload, without attributing the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Further investigation revealed that [[rick_lax_and_viral_content_creation | Rick Lax]] had also posted the "ultimate nacho hack" two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Many related Facebook pages linked to the content creators (such as Adley and Taylor Watson) featured a "[[rick_lax_and_viral_content_creation | Rick Lax]] Productions" logo, indicating a broader network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## Rick Lax Productions and Content Strategy

[[rick_lax_and_viral_content_creation | Rick Lax Productions]] is a production outlet that runs various shows, including "The Adley Show" (associated with the nacho hack) and other pages that produce gross-out food videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. These videos follow a consistent formula:
*   **Implausible Scenarios** The person cooking claims to have performed the "hack" numerous times, despite clear evidence (e.g., spotless countertops) that suggests otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **"Hype Person" Trope** A person behind the camera provides exaggerated reactions, initially expressing incredulity but quickly shifting to effusive "wows" and unmotivated praise for the bizarre cooking methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This hype person often asks obvious questions ("What are you going to do with an ice cream scooper?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Lack of Practicality** The "recipes" are often unappetizing, impractical, and wasteful, such as cooking spaghetti or mac and cheese directly on a counter rather than in a pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Ingredients are haphazardly mixed by hand, with claims like "this is easier" than using utensils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Deliberate Outrage Bait** Many statements are made to provoke a reaction, such as claiming "real Italians" make spaghetti on a counter or insisting charcuterie boards are "out of style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. The videos are not intended to be practical [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | food hacks]] but rather a "charade" for views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## Parody and Audience Perception

While [[rick_lax_and_viral_content_creation | Rick Lax]] Productions videos often include disclaimers stating that the content is "purely fictitious," "scripted dramas, [[role_of_parody_in_food_content_creation | parody]], and satire," these disclaimers are rarely shared when the videos go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. This absence of context leads audiences to perceive the videos as genuine attempts at [[effectiveness_of_life_hacks_on_youtube | life hacks]] or cooking demonstrations, resulting in widespread anger and upset reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

The primary goal of these videos is "outrage clicks" and virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. A spaghetti hack video, when shared without context on social media, garnered over 9 million views, 60,000 likes, and 50,000 retweets, almost all from people expressing anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. It even became a nationwide trending topic in the United States, with "Prego" (a pasta sauce brand) trending due to the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Celebrities like Patton Oswalt also reacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. This demonstrates the significant [[impact_of_pranks_on_youtube | impact of pranks]] or [[impact_of_fictional_influencers_on_audiences | fictional influencer]] content on audience perception, similar to the broader [[impact_of_shane_dawsons_content_on_youtube_culture | impact of Shane Dawson's content]].

## Rick Lax's Stance and Ethical Considerations

[[rick_lax_and_viral_content_creation | Rick Lax]] maintains that his recipes are "legitimately meant to be practical" and objects to descriptions like "gross" or "awful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. He defines "good videos" as those that "perform well on social media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. He is also adamant that when his videos go viral outside of Facebook without proper attribution, they are "stolen," and he has issued DMCA takedown notices to creators who react to his content without linking back to his page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.

Despite [[rick_lax_and_viral_content_creation | Rick Lax]]'s claims, even the creators featured in the videos acknowledge their impracticality; one participant, "Getty spaghetti," stated, "It's nothing that people should do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. Critics argue that these videos represent a [[the_ethics_of_wasting_food_for_viral_videos | waste of food]] and contribute to a "weird internet moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. The phenomenon highlights how deliberate provocation can drive massive engagement and virality in online food content.

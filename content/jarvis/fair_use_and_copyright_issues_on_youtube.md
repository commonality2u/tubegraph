Online content creators, particularly on YouTube, frequently navigate complex [[copyright_issues_and_content_plagiarism_on_youtube | copyright issues and content plagiarism on YouTube]] and the principles of fair use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. These challenges often lead to public disputes and raise [[ethical_concerns_about_content_appropriation_on_youtube | ethical concerns about content appropriation on YouTube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Disputes over Content Usage

A significant example of these issues involves animated story channels, which have been a "laughing stock on YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. One prominent channel, "My Story Animated," engaged in a public dispute with a YouTuber named Jay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Jay had created a reaction video to one of their animated stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

My Story Animated demanded that Jay remove his video, threatening his channel if he did not comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. They claimed to have sent YouTube messages and emails to Jay, asserting he "never responded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The messages from My Story Animated were described as feeling as though they were "written by an eighth grader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

They argued that Jay "never asked us for permission to react to our videos and he just did it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. My Story Animated even suggested that if Jay reacted to other animated TV shows like "Death Note" or "Avatar: The Last Airbender," his channel "will be deleted in like five seconds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. They seemed unaware of the commentary community on YouTube, where "Avatar: The Last Airbender" is frequently the subject of video essays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

My Story Animated initially posted a lengthy message, which they later deleted because it was "too long and no one was reading it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. They then released a shorter statement asserting:
> "We hold the right to deny anyone from using our videos. We have the same rights to our work as any big studio or franchise. Why is it so hard to understand that YouTube artists also have some degree of control over the videos they work so hard to produce." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>

### Contradictory Stances on Permissions

Despite their firm stance against Jay's reaction video, My Story Animated had previously stated a contradictory policy:
> "You don't need our approval to make videos... We get many requests from YouTubers that want to make reaction videos to our stories. You don't need our approval to do them. We'll allow any YouTuber to make them freely. We also love to watch them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>

This shift in position suggests that the "animated story game ain't like what it used to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, with "big players dropping like flies" and views declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This environment may make channels "paranoid and like clinging on to dear life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, contributing to [[discussion_on_youtube_content_creation_challenges | challenges in YouTube content creation]].

## The "True Stories" Channel: Content and Critique

Another channel, "True Stories," exemplifies issues related to [[criticism_of_lowquality_content_on_youtube_channels | criticism of low-quality content on YouTube channels]] and the nature of [[content_farms_on_youtube | content farms on YouTube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This channel claims to create "animated stories for mature audiences intended to promote critical thinking and moral reasoning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, their content often features "sensational gross shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> and lacks "commentary or critique" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

One example is their video titled "My Mother Loves My Cream," which explicitly depicts a mother using her son's semen for skincare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Another video, "I'm a Breastfed Adult," features a character named "Jarvis" who is a caricature of the speaker, detailing a fictional life story about lifelong breastfeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The video includes details like claims of different "flavor profiles" between breasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, breastfeeding in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, and consuming breast milk from a sister and wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The video attempts to rationalize adult breastfeeding as "biologically normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> and "the perfect food for growing humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, while also pushing anti-dairy propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

Such content raises questions about [[youtube_content_and_video_production | YouTube content and video production]] standards and the fine line between parody and harmful content. If a video is intended as parody but "no one knows its parody then you didn't make parody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The speaker urges viewers not to support channels like True Stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. He also states that if "True Stories" were to copyright strike his commentary video, it would be an opportunity to "put fair use to the test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

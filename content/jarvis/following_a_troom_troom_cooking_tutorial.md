From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The creator embarked on a holiday-themed project to test the validity of a [[Troom Troom video analysis | Troom Troom]] cooking tutorial, aiming to follow a recipe from the channel known for its "ridiculous DIY channel with life hacks as weird as they are useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. [[Troom Troom's Reputation and Content Style | Troom Troom]] is widely recognized on YouTube for its clickbait thumbnails, unnamed characters, and the mystery surrounding its operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The channel is also known for its "obsessive desire to stay topical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, often posting unusual content like "unicorn hack videos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## The Chosen Tutorial: DIY Giant vs. Miniature Christmas Candy

The specific [[Recreating and Reviewing Troom Troom Videos | Troom Troom]] video chosen for this experiment was titled "DIY Giant vs. Miniature Christmas Candy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The video's thumbnail featured a gigantic gingerbread man resembling the character from Shrek, lounging on a couch while a character painted its mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The creator immediately identified this as classic [[Troom Troom video analysis | Troom Troom]] clickbait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, knowing it was unlikely to deliver on the visual promise.

## Ingredient Sourcing and Preparation

The [[Recreating and Reviewing Troom Troom Videos | Troom Troom]] video presented an actual recipe, beginning with mashing five ounces of butter with the same amount of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The creator encountered several [[Challenges with Cooking and Baking | challenges with cooking and baking]] during this phase:
*   **Sugar Substitution**: White sugar was called for, but only brown sugar was available, raising concerns about ruining the recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Measuring Issues**: Difficulty measuring ingredients, particularly struggling to get brown sugar out of its bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Melting Butter**: The tutorial instructed melting butter in a microwave in a bowl that appeared to be metal, leading to nervousness about sparks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Honey**: Extracting five ounces of honey from a bottle proved very difficult, prompting the realization that heating the honey first might have helped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Eggs**: Two "medium grade double-A eggs" were added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, with surprisingly hard shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Spices**: A teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of ground ginger were added, giving the mixture a festive smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Dough Preparation and Shaping

Flour (25 ounces) was gradually added, and the dough was kneaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. As the dough thickened, the creator resorted to kneading by hand, noting its play-doh like consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Lacking construction paper for a stencil and a rolling pin, the dough was free-handed into a gingerbread man shape and flattened using a water bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Baking Process

The gingerbread man was baked at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. A critical mistake was made when the creator nearly put wax paper, not parchment paper, into the hot oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Upon removal, the gingerbread man's color was lighter than the original dough, and it had an odd "boil" on its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Despite tasting "go," it was unclear if it was properly baked, and flipping it to bake further did not help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Glaze and Decoration

A glaze was prepared using 10 ounces of powdered sugar, half a lemon's juice, and a little water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Despite the gingerbread man's poor appearance, it was decorated with a bowtie, a smile, and eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Initial Taste Test and Discoveries

The initial gingerbread man was "so soft" and tasted "horrible," with a burnt smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. It was described as "cardboard" or "something you'd build a house out of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The creator realized the dough was likely not kneaded long enough, resulting in a super dense texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## Attempting a "Giant" Gingerbread Man

To achieve the "giant" size from the [[Troom Troom video analysis | Troom Troom]] thumbnail, the creator decided to build the gingerbread man in parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. The head was made from the leftover dough of the first batch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, while other limbs required a new batch of dough with altered ingredients to improve the taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. The head turned out "very dark" from being baked too long, while the arms were "very light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

A novel but problematic solution was employed to bind the parts: melted gummy bears as "cement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This proved challenging, with the pieces breaking off due to the weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

## Final Reveal and Public Reaction

The final "giant" gingerbread man was described as a "badly burned beach dolphin" by a friend and caused a new roommate to scream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. The heat from filming lights caused the icing to melt, leading to its eventual "horror movie" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. The taste test of the second batch yielded a slightly improved but still unappetizing result, described as "hard wood" and "cardboard with a hint of cinnamon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

## Conclusion on [[Troom Troom's Reputation and Content Style | Troom Troom]]'s Recipe

The creator concluded that the [[Troom Troom video analysis | Troom Troom]] recipe was "very bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Comparing it to other gingerbread recipes, it was noted that key ingredients like molasses were missing, which is a common mistake for those trying to make gingerbread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. The resulting gingerbread was "structurally sound" but lacked taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

The experience highlighted that [[Troom Troom's Reputation and Content Style | Troom Troom]] likely doesn't expect anyone to actually try their video recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. While the tutorial had entertainment value, the end product was inedible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This aligns with [[public_reactions_to_unconventional_cooking_methods | public reactions]] to many [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | viral food hacks on social media]], such as [[TikTok cooking hacks | TikTok cooking hacks]] or [[TikTok food hacks using toilets | TikTok food hacks using toilets]], which often prioritize novelty over practicality or taste.

The presence of [[brands_as_people_marketing_strategy | brands as people]] on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, has become a widespread phenomenon beyond just fast-food chains like Wendy's and Burger King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This trend involves companies attempting to be [[brands_using_social_media_for_relatable_content | relatable content]] and engage with users in a human-like manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Evolution of Brand Personification

The concept of [[brands_as_people_marketing_strategy | brands personifying themselves]] dates back to the beginning of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. On platforms like Twitter, early brand accounts aimed to communicate about their activities in a way that mimicked personal updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Key Milestones and Examples

*   **Denny's:** Often credited with pioneering the trend of brands being relatable through memes on Tumblr around 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Early Twitter:** Wendy's, for instance, posted relatable content almost a decade ago, such as pretending chocolate milk was a Frosty substitute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **The "Cry for Help" Trend:** Sunny D's tweet "I can't do this anymore" during the Super Bowl was perceived as a cry for help, leading to a viral reaction and other brands joining in with supportive messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This included Pop-Tarts, MoonPie, and Little Debbie, with DiGiorno even tweeting about "depression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Escalation of Antics:**
    *   [[corporate_humor_and_communication_on_social_media_platforms | Brands are now engaging in more extreme forms of humor]], including roasting fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   Examples include Wendy's dropping a "cringey" mixtape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> and Chester Cheetah releasing a diss track about Doritos (despite both being owned by the same company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   Even brands like Orville Redenbacher have been linked to bizarre, possibly deleted, tweets about personal hygiene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   [[Brands seeking clout and attention | Brands seeking clout and attention]] can lead to unusual interactions, such as Elon Musk flirting with the planet Mars' Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   Sonic the Hedgehog's official Twitter account engages in meme culture and humorous interactions with other brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   Even Twitter's own account tweets like a person, participating in conversations and featuring celebrities like Chrissy Teigen interacting with the personified Twitter bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   Arby's Twitter account is known for creating anime food art, while the "nihilist Arby's" parody account has become indistinguishable from the real thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

## The Strategy Behind Brand Personification

Marketing blogs often highlight humor as a key factor in making a [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brand followable]] on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Humor, including clever language, pop culture references, and "meme-jacking," helps brands stand out and build a personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The goal is to create [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | social media engagements by brands]] that provide valuable content, offer promotions, or simply be "ridiculously funny" to appeal to [[consumer_behavior_and_brand_interactions_on_social_media | consumer behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Who is Behind the Accounts?

The humanization of brands is typically not managed by marketing executives in boardrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Instead, [[behind_the_scenes_of_social_media_management_for_brands | social media accounts are run by regular people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. These individuals, often younger, use their limited freedom to "goof around" while trying to pay rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

*   **Nathan:** Runs the Steak-umm Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Amber Gordon:** Was 23 when she managed Denny's social media, leading to its rise to fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   Social media management is often not a high-paying job with good benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Criticism and Impact

While brands aim to increase sales through "shitposts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, the [[the_impact_of_brand_antics_on_consumer_perception | impact of brand antics on consumer perception]] can be mixed. There is a call to criticize "weird advertising practices" but to avoid harassing the individuals managing these accounts, who are simply doing their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. The humanization of a brand should not prevent criticism of the brand itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

The trend of brands acting human on social media may fill a need that already exists between consumers and brands, especially in cultures that celebrate brands, such as through Super Bowl commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This process of "corporate humanization" allows real people to represent the collective humanity of business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

The internet hosts numerous videos claiming to show evidence of mermaids, particularly on platforms like TikTok. These videos often feature blurry footage and raise questions about their authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Many of these [[mermaid_sightings_and_tiktok | mermaid sightings and TikTok]] videos contribute to a broader landscape of online misinformation and conspiracy theories.

## Viral Mermaid Content on TikTok

A significant amount of mermaid content on TikTok is created by users like [[phoebe_daniels_and_mermaid_tiktok_content | Phoebe Daniels]] (phebed_underscore), an Australian creator with 1.2 million followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Her videos often present unclear footage and ask viewers for their interpretations, using hashtags such as "mermaids," "sea creature," "washed up," and even "vampire" and "alien" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. This approach encourages engagement and speculation, contributing to the viral spread of unsubstantiated claims.

## Critiquing the "Evidence"

Videos purporting to show mermaids frequently rely on low-quality or manipulated visuals:
*   **Ambiguous Footage**: Many clips are described as "fuzzy" or "blurry," making definitive identification impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Despite the lack of clarity, creators often assert that the content clearly shows a mermaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Misidentification of Known Animals**: Some footage that is claimed to show mermaids or sirens could actually be a known sea creature, such as a dolphin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Commentary on these videos often highlights how easy it is to mistake common marine life for mythical beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Staged Content**: Several videos appear to be staged, such as one where a person returns a crab to the water, only for it to be "thrown back" by an unseen entity, suggesting a pre-planned event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. Siren sound videos also show signs of being staged, with creators biding time for events to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. This aligns with broader [[criticism_of_sensationalist_content_on_youtube | criticism of sensationalist content on YouTube]] and [[criticism_of_fake_animated_stories_on_youtube | fake animated stories]].

### The "Mermaid Corpse" Debunked

A notable example of misleading content involves claims of a "real mermaid caught in Mindanao" or "remains found in the Philippines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. This imagery is derived from *Mermaid: The Body Found*, a mockumentary from Animal Planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Creators like [[phoebe_daniels_and_mermaid_tiktok_content | Phoebe Daniels]] were criticized for sharing this footage despite knowing its fictional origin, which is seen as "feeding us fake mermaid news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. Such instances highlight the need for [[analyzing_misleading_and_poorly_researched_facts_in_online_content | analyzing misleading and poorly researched facts in online content]].

## Siren Song Videos and Conspiracy Theories

Videos claiming to feature siren songs often present indistinguishable high-pitched sounds as evidence of mythical creatures. These videos frequently include dialogue from individuals who adamantly assert the sounds are not dolphins or whales, despite a clear lack of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. The staging of these interactions is also apparent, with creators seemingly acting out conversations to make their claims more dramatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

Some creators suggest that their accounts are banned because "the truth was getting out to too many people," implying a conspiracy to suppress information about mermaids and sirens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. This narrative fits within the common pattern of [[youtube_conspiracies_and_misleading_content | YouTube conspiracies and misleading content]], where deletion or censorship is framed as proof of a hidden agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. The idea is that "people at the Tik top...don't want us knowing about the siren song out in the ocean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.

While these videos aim to entertain or provoke curiosity, they often lack credible evidence and rely on dramatic presentation rather than scientific inquiry. Many simply invite viewers to "think" without providing any factual basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

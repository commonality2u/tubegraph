"Cooking directly on countertops" refers to a [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | viral food trend]] where individuals prepare and sometimes even serve food directly on kitchen counters, eschewing traditional cooking vessels and plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This unusual method is primarily driven by the pursuit of views on social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Prominent Examples

Several videos showcasing this method have gained significant traction online:

*   **The Ultimate Nacho Hack**: This hack involves blending ingredients directly on the counter with bare hands, forming them into a ball with an ice cream scooper, and then eating them from a cone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The person behind the camera often expresses little surprise, asking questions like, "What are you gonna do with an ice cream scooper?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **The Ultimate Spaghetti Trick**: This video features spaghetti and sauce being mixed directly on a kitchen counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Hot Dog Mac and Cheese**: Another variation involves cooked macaroni and hot dogs spread across the counter, then mixed with butter, cheese, and seasoning by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This recipe claims to feed a lot of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a> and suggests it's an activity "your kids would love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Countertop Dip/Party Trick**: Presented as an alternative to charcuterie boards, this involves various dip ingredients like queso, black beans, jalapenos, and sour cream being layered and mixed on the counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Common Characteristics of the Videos

These videos often follow a distinct formula:

*   **Hype Person**: A person behind the camera provides exaggerated reactions, ranging from initial incredulity ("Is it the easiest way?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>) to unmotivated "wows" and "oh my gosh" as the preparation progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This person eventually becomes "fully radicalized" into believing the unusual cooking methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Claim of Convenience**: The creators often assert that cooking on the counter eliminates the need for dishes or creates no mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, despite the obvious food spread across the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. One suggested "logical explanation" is that the countertops are replaced after each use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Repetitive Dialogue**: The hype person frequently asks redundant questions like "What are you going to do with that?" when the action is self-evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Misleading Claims**:
    *   **"Easiest Way"**: These methods are presented as the "easiest way" to cook, even when conventional methods using pots and bowls are clearly simpler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   **"Family Tradition"**: Creators may claim it's a family tradition or specific cultural method, such as "real Italians" making spaghetti this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, which is generally used to provoke a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   **Health Claims**: Despite using large amounts of butter or being part of otherwise unhealthy dishes, ingredients like black beans are highlighted for making the dish "really healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Aesthetics**: The dishes are described as "pretty looking" or "gorgeous," even when they appear messy or unappetizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Lack of Utensils**: Despite having access to pots (e.g., for boiling pasta), the food is intentionally dumped onto the counter and mixed by hand to make it seem "easier" and "more fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **"Family Style" Serving**: Food is served directly from the counter, with guests expected to gather around and eat from the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Origin and Intent

These videos are largely attributed to **Rick Lax Productions**, a venture by magician Rick Lax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. He runs several shows, and many of the "gross out food videos" are connected to his network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

The primary purpose of these videos is to generate outrage and clicks, rather than provide genuine culinary instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Rick Lax maintains that his "recipes" are legitimately meant to be practical, but clarifies that "good videos" mean "videos that perform well on social media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

### Disclaimers

Rick Lax Productions often includes disclaimers on their pages, stating that the videos are "purely fictitious," "for entertainment purposes only," and feature "scripted dramas, parody act parody and satire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. However, when these videos are shared, this context is often omitted, leading to widespread misinterpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

## [[public_reactions_to_unconventional_cooking_methods | Public Reactions]]

When these videos are shared without context, the [[public_reactions_to_unconventional_cooking_methods | public reactions]] are overwhelmingly negative, characterized by anger and disgust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. A spaghetti hack video posted without context went viral, accumulating millions of views, likes, and retweets, with comments consistently expressing anger at the people in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

This phenomenon even became a nationwide trending topic in the United States, with brands like Prego being unintentionally caught in the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Celebrities like Patton Oswalt (voice of Remy in *Ratatouille*) also chimed in on the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

An article by Eater chronicled this trend, quoting Rick Lax's stance that he objects to calling the recipes "gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Interestingly, one of the performers, Getty, admitted about her recipes, "It's nothing that people should do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

Rick Lax is particularly vocal about his videos being "stolen" when shared outside Facebook without attribution, even issuing DMCA takedown notices for re-uploads, despite previously not providing attribution to original creators himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.

## Critique

Beyond the intent for [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | virality]], these videos are criticized for being a significant waste of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a> and for promoting unsanitary or impractical cooking methods that are not meant to be replicated by viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. They represent a [[bizarre_and_impractical_diy_trends | bizarre and impractical DIY trend]] that exists purely for online engagement.

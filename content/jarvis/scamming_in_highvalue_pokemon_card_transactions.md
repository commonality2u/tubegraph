The world of high-value Pokémon card collecting has seen a surge in interest, partly fueled by influencers like [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, this increased attention has also attracted bad actors, leading to incidents like [[the_incident_involving_dumb_money_and_fake_pokemon_cards | the Dumb Money and fake Pokémon card controversy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The Rise of Pokémon Card Collecting

[[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]] significantly impacted the Pokémon card market when he purchased a first edition base set box for approximately $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. He streamed the unboxing of these cards, selling packs and generating around $400,000, with over $100,000 donated to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This event contributed to what has been termed "the [[the_impact_of_logan_paul_on_the_pokemon_card_market | Logan Paul effect]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, causing Pokémon card prices to reach an all-time high and inspiring many new collectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## The Dumb Money Investment Attempt

The YouTube channel "Dumb Money," consisting of three experienced investors, decided to spend $500,000 on Pokémon cards as a stunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Their plan was to purchase the world's most expensive first edition box for $375,000, nearly double what [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]] paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Unlike Paul, the "Dumb Money" investors admitted they knew nothing about Pokémon and were motivated purely by investment, not nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

They intended to stream the purchase live and donate the proceeds from selling the cards to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. To ensure authenticity, they invited Pokémon experts like Leonhart and Scott Emmer to the live stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The stream setup was elaborate, with multiple cameramen, a boom operator, and an armed security guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## The Seller: Collectibles Guru

The seller of the alleged first edition box was a collector known as [[collectibles_guru_and_his_role_in_the_pokemon_card_controversy | Collectibles Guru]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, who also goes by "Crypto King" from the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. While [[collectibles_guru_and_his_role_in_the_pokemon_card_controversy | Collectibles Guru]] had previously sold legitimate graded cards to [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, there were several red flags concerning his credibility.

### Red Flags

*   Upon meeting [[logan_pauls_interest_in_pokemon_cards | Logan Paul]], [[collectibles_guru_and_his_role_in_the_pokemon_card_controversy | Collectibles Guru]] referenced a "drug deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   He became a meme in the Pokémon community for claiming a Bulbasaur card worth $3,000-$4,000 was worth $30,000, doubling down despite Paul's disbelief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   His social media presence was perceived as "not nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   The live stream chat was filled with comments calling him a "scammer" and accusing him of trying to "hyperinflate prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### The Transaction and Unraveling of the Scam

During the live stream, [[collectibles_guru_and_his_role_in_the_pokemon_card_controversy | Collectibles Guru]] provided a backstory for the box, claiming it was one of three purchased by the owner's parents when they were children and stored in a gun safe for 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. He then attempted to explain away suspicious wear on the box, suggesting it might have been resealed 20 years ago or was due to pressure from being stacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. He repeatedly assured the buyers it "all seemed legit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

> [!warning] Chat Warnings
> The live stream chat constantly warned the "Dumb Money" guys, with comments like, "looks like a hostage negotiation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a> and "I heard the bald dude's a crypto scammer who's moved to Pokemon to hyperinflate prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. One prominent comment, "why are you guys even in the same room as these scammers," remained on screen for five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

When the box was finally opened, the Pokémon experts confirmed it was resealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Not only were the packs not first edition, but they contained cards from 2020, disproving [[collectibles_guru_and_his_role_in_the_pokemon_card_controversy | Collectibles Guru's]] claim that any resealing would have happened 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Aftermath and Resolution

The "Dumb Money" investors were remarkably calm about the [[the_incident_involving_dumb_money_and_fake_pokemon_cards | incident involving dumb money and fake Pokemon cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, asking if [[collectibles_guru_and_his_role_in_the_pokemon_card_controversy | Collectibles Guru]] would be okay getting his money back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. [[collectibles_guru_and_his_role_in_the_pokemon_card_controversy | Collectibles Guru]] immediately called the alleged original seller of the box, who seemingly answered within seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

Ultimately, the "Dumb Money" guys were able to purchase a legitimate first edition box, though not from the original alleged seller and for approximately $350,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. This new transaction also occurred on a poorly streamed live event, but the buyers appeared satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. Despite the resolution, suspicion remains around [[collectibles_guru_and_his_role_in_the_pokemon_card_controversy | Collectibles Guru's]] involvement, with no one in the Pokémon community vouching for his trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

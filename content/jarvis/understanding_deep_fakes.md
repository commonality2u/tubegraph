## What are Deep Fakes?
[[the_technology_behind_deep_fakes | Deep fakes]] are a form of synthetic media where a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The technology behind deep fakes uses artificial intelligence (AI) and requires a significant amount of photographs and references of the person being deep faked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. For example, to create a deep fake of Tom Cruise, numerous images from various angles and vantage points are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Celebrities like Tom Cruise are easier to deep fake due to the abundance of available images and movie footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## How Deep Fakes Work
[[the_technology_behind_deep_fakes | Deep fakes]] leverage artificial intelligence to map one person's likeness onto another's body in video or images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This process requires extensive data, such as photographs and video references of the target individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Movies, being sequences of photos, provide a rich source of data for creating deep fakes of famous people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## Noteworthy Examples of Deep Fakes
[[deep_fakes_in_media_and_entertainment | Deep fakes]] have been used for various purposes, from malicious content to comedic sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

### Viral Tom Cruise Deep Fake
A deep fake of Tom Cruise went viral on TikTok, captivating audiences with its realistic portrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The videos, created by Chris Ume (also spelled Chris Umi) and his team, took months to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Ume, who aims to work in Hollywood, hired a Tom Cruise impersonator to achieve accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. The TikTok account "deep tom cruise" transparently labels its content as deep fakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

Examples from the viral videos include:
*   Tom Cruise tripping and immediately telling an irrelevant story about Mikhail Gorbachev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   The deep fake Tom Cruise exhibiting exaggerated laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   A "Mission Impossible"-like judo chop in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
*   An unusual scene where the deep fake Tom Cruise chomps on a lollipop, discovering bubble gum inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This was done to "flex the technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

### Other Notable Deep Fakes
*   **Harry Styles Sketch**: A humorous TikTok sketch featuring [[deep_fakes_in_media_and_entertainment | Harry Styles]] that is not actually him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Jarvis Johnson/Hard Rock Nick**: A "horrifying instance" where Hard Rock Nick's face was deep faked onto Jarvis Johnson's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Jordan Peele Obama Deep Fake**: A well-known deep fake created by Jordan Peele featuring Barack Obama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
*   **Bill Hader Deep Fake (Control Shift Face)**: A video from 2019 by the YouTube channel Control Shift Face shows Bill Hader seamlessly transforming into different celebrities like Tom Cruise and Seth Rogen while telling a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. This video went viral and demonstrated the eerie potential of face-swapping technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

### Audio Deep Fakes
Beyond visual deep fakes, technology exists for [[the_technology_behind_deep_fakes | deep fakes for audio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. The combination of audio and video deep fakes makes it incredibly difficult to discern reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

> "you combine the audio defects with the video deep fakes and they come together like peanut butter and uh the fact that nothing is real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>

## Risks and Concerns
[[risks_and_concerns_of_deep_fake_usage | Deep fakes]] present significant [[risks_and_concerns_of_deep_fake_usage | concerns]] due to their potential for malicious applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

*   **Malicious Use**: One major concern is the use of deep fakes to place someone's likeness into inappropriate or lewd videos without consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Real-world Crime**: A Pennsylvania woman was accused of doctoring photos and videos of her daughter's cheerleading rivals using deep fake technology to get them removed from the squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. This resulted in three misdemeanor counts of cyber harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
*   **Privacy Breach**: The use of deep fakes, especially involving minors like Charlie D'Amelio, is seen as a breach of privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.
*   **Information Manipulation**: Deep fakes contribute to how [[impact_of_fake_stories_on_youtube | fake news]] operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. They exploit the fact that individuals cannot critically evaluate every piece of content they encounter online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. A seemingly innocuous deep fake, like Tom Cruise golfing, can subtly reinforce existing beliefs, creating an "insidious foot in the door" for more dangerous fabrications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.

## Public Perception and Misconceptions
Despite the growing capabilities of deep fake technology, public perception can be misinformed. Comments on articles about deep fakes often dismiss their realism or potential impact:

*   "If this is the best deep fakery can do, then why worry?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>
*   "The fake doesn't look anything like Tom Cruise for goodness sake." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>
*   "I'd like evidence that it wasn't Cruz." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>

The "uncanny valley" effect means that while a deep fake in motion might look unnatural or "faked," a paused frame can appear identical to the real person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. Many people, especially when not paying close attention or viewing from a distance, may not identify a deep fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. Some commentators display a bias, proudly stating they weren't fooled, while those who were tricked are less likely to admit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>.

## Regulation and Awareness
[[regulation_and_ethical_implications_of_deep_fakes | Regulating]] deep fakes is complex, but awareness of their existence and potential is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>.

*   **TikTok Policy**: TikTok has a policy against deep fakes, removing content that attempts to impersonate individuals without clear indication it's a deep fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>. The Tom Cruise deep fake was not removed because it was clearly labeled as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.
*   **The Impossible Task**: It is an "impossible task" to expect every individual to critically investigate the authenticity of every piece of content they encounter online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.
*   **Slippery Slope**: There is a "slippery slope" regarding the unchecked proliferation of deep fakes, making awareness of this technology paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>. It's essential to understand what's possible and not believe everything seen online, as even without fancy effects, people can be tricked and influenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.

The long-running reality television franchise, [[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]], is often critiqued as a bad television show, with much of its audience expecting it to be so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Despite this, the show can still disappoint due to its inherent flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. A significant factor in the show's structure and reception is the pervasive [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | role of producers and editing]] in manufacturing drama and driving narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

## Production Choices and Casting
[[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]] typically follows a formula where a contestant from *The Bachelor* becomes *The Bachelorette*, and a contestant from *The Bachelorette* becomes *The Bachelor* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. However, producers sometimes "disrupt the natural order" to create unique situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For instance, Matt James was cast as the first Black Bachelor without having been a contestant on *The Bachelorette* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This decision made him an "outsider" and a "false king" in the Bachelor royalty hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. While Matt James was considered for Clare's season, he didn't appear, making his fast-tracked casting unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. His main qualification seemed to be his friendship with a popular *Bachelorette* contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Producers have also been accused of casting individuals with questionable histories potentially for ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Manufactured Introductions and Early Drama
Every season begins with "fun and interesting intros of its kooky cast of characters," which are often "dumb and unnecessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Contestants arrive one by one, often performing "weird bits that the producers told them to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Examples include a woman dressed as a sloth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> or another brandishing a "personal pleasure device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. These introductions often set the stage for [[the_bachelor_contestant_stereotypes | obvious villains or borderline plants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, such as Queen Victoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Prioritizing Petty Drama
Instead of focusing on contestants' characters or genuine connections, the producers of Matt James's season spent most of their time on "petty drama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This means viewers are more likely to see a contestant like Victoria calling someone a "hoe" than emotional connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Producers also orchestrate situations where a contestant, painted as "needy and selfish," is ganged up on by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This was evident with Sarah, who was dealing with a difficult personal situation (her father's terminal illness) and was unable to contact her family due to show rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. When she chose to leave the show, her departure was celebrated by the "mean girl avengers," which was seen as "evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Introducing New Contestants for Conflict
To maintain high-tension drama, producers sometimes introduce new contestants mid-season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This move is interpreted as a desperate attempt to create new conflict, preventing the producers from having to "start treating our contestants as people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

This influx of new contestants directly led to one of the season's major dramas: Anna baselessly claiming that new girl Brittany was an "escort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Despite the potential for ruining Brittany's life and reputation (her name became linked with "escort" in Google searches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, this false rumor was allowed to air. Critics argue that producers should have cut such defamatory content from the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Handling Controversies and Their Aftermath
The production team's handling of controversies is a major point of criticism, highlighting how [[dramatization_and_editing_in_reality_tv | dramatization and editing]] can have serious real-world impacts.

### Rachel Kirkconnell's Antebellum Party Photos
Rumors and photos surfaced showing front-runner Rachel Kirkconnell at an antebellum-themed sorority party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Celebrating a period defined by slavery was widely condemned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. In damage control, producers deployed long-time host Chris Harrison to defend Rachel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. His attempt to defend her to Rachel Lindsay, the first Black Bachelorette, was deemed a "complete and total disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Harrison questioned if it was "not a good look in 2018" or "2021," downplaying the severity by suggesting "50 million people did that in 2018" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

This incident, part of [[racial_issues_and_controversies_within_the_bachelor | racial issues and controversies within The Bachelor]], led to Chris Harrison being replaced as host for the aftershow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, and eventually, future seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Rachel Lindsay was also harassed off Instagram for calmly explaining Harrison's flawed logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, and both she and Matt James had to deactivate accounts or delete posts due to harassment, suggesting the optics of the situation led to severe backlash for those involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. The question remains whether producers knew about Rachel's past before casting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

## Overall Critique of Producer Actions
The constant manipulation by producers puts contestants in "very rough situations for drama," but often doesn't even result in "good TV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. The season featuring Matt James was described as "bad" because of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. The focus on sensationalism over genuine connection has led to a show that "messing with people's lives for entertainment has gone too far" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>, and there are "other ways to make television interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. This suggests a broader [[critique_of_the_bachelor_as_a_television_show | critique of The Bachelor as a television show]] based on its production ethics.

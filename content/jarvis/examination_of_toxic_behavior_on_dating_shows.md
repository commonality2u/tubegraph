From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The reality television dating show *The Bachelorette*, a spin-off of *The Bachelor*, is criticized for its approach to selecting contestants and its portrayal of relationships, often showcasing problematic behaviors for drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The show, which positions itself as a quest for "true love" and marriage, frequently features contestants with "toxic dynamics and bullying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

In this season, the star is Hannah B, who was previously heartbroken by Colton in *The Bachelor* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Despite her genuine and cheerful demeanor, she is surrounded by what are described as "the worst guys in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Prominent Examples of Toxic Behavior

### Luke P: The Manipulative Villain

A significant portion of the season's airtime is dedicated to Luke P, who dominates the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Described as a five-foot-nine Bible study leader with "an anger management problem" and "big Napoleon energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, he is consistently characterized as a "manipulative and aggressive manchild" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> who uses his religiosity as a shield from criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. He manages to reach the final four despite his awful behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Examples of Luke P's toxic actions include:
*   **Physical Aggression:** During a rugby game in Rhode Island, Luke P randomly bodyslams another contestant, Luke S, who did not even have the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The show even added a punch sound effect to emphasize the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. He then attempts to justify his actions by claiming self-defense against Luke S, an excuse that Hannah inexplicably accepts, leading to Luke S's elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Disregard for Boundaries:** After Hannah attempts to eliminate him, Luke P refuses to leave, claiming he still believes Hannah wants him there, even though she explicitly states otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Childish Antics:** He places baloney on another contestant's lap in a bizarre act of provocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, easily aggravated by others trolling him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Controlling Behavior and Religious Hypocrisy:** During the "fantasy suites" episode, Luke P attempts to control Hannah by telling her not to be "sexually intimate" with other contestants, claiming it's "not what a good Christian girl would do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. He threatens to leave if she admits to having sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Hannah realizes she dislikes his controlling nature and tries to eliminate him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Persistent Stalking and Harassment:** Despite being sent home, Luke P repeatedly returns, ignoring Hannah's clear rejections and boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. His actions, including showing up uninvited and making unsettling statements like "I'm coming," are equated to threats and harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. The show's producers are complicit, providing him with props like a van and an engagement ring to prolong the drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## Jed: The Deceptive Opportunist

Jed, the eventual "winner" of the season, also exhibits toxic behavior related to his intentions on the show:
*   **Misleading Intentions:** Jed claims to be a musician, constantly promoting himself throughout the season, and only admits he came on the show for his music career *after* claiming to have fallen in love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This is contrasted with Luke S, who was eliminated for supposedly planning to promote his tequila business, even though it didn't exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Lack of Readiness for Marriage:** Both Jed's family and Hannah's family express doubts about his readiness for marriage, citing his focus on his music career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. His primary musical "accomplishment" is a dog food jingle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
*   **Pre-Show Girlfriend Scandal:** After the show concludes with Jed's proposal, a People magazine article reveals he had a serious girlfriend before joining the show, whom he "ghosted" to appear on *The Bachelorette* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. Jed attempts to deny the seriousness of the relationship, despite admitting to taking multiple trips with her, meeting her family, and telling her he loved her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. He was also reportedly bragging about winning the show to his friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. This revelation leads to Hannah breaking off their engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

## Show's Complicity and Impact on Contestants

The [[critique_of_reality_tv_and_its_portrayal_of_relationships | show is accused of being complicit in condoning toxic behavior]] for the sake of drama, particularly with Luke P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. This subjects Hannah to "ridiculous and emotionally manipulative situations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Hannah herself shared on Instagram that she would stare at a wall when overwhelmed, highlighting the stress of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

While the show eventually attempts to backtrack and criticize Luke P and Jed's actions, the overall approach of allowing such behavior to dominate the season is seen as a "lacking in self-awareness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. The show's premise, combined with its production choices, suggests that it is more interested in generating drama than genuinely helping individuals find love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. The increasing absurdity in how contestants fail to marry on the "marriage game show" is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

Despite its flaws and the problematic behaviors it highlights, the show's entertainment value is acknowledged, primarily due to the community and content created around it, rather than the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. The [[discussion_on_the_impact_of_media_on_contestants_lives | constant pursuit of dramatic narratives]] ultimately subjects contestants to challenging and often emotionally damaging experiences.

## Current Public Sentiment
Many users are currently dissatisfied with Instagram's direction, feeling that the app, which was originally focused on photos, is now attempting to emulate [[influence_of_apps_like_tiktok_on_instagram | TikTok]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This shift is part of a broader trend where platforms like YouTube and Facebook are also incorporating short vertical video feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These "TikTok copycats" often recycle and repackage content that originated on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Instagram's History and Evolution
Instagram began in 2010 as a mobile check-in app similar to Foursquare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. To avoid competing directly with Foursquare, its creators shifted the app's focus to photo sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. A key innovation, photo filters, was added after founder Kevin Systrom's wife expressed reluctance to post photos because they wouldn't look as good as others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Filters allowed users to enhance their photos, making them more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

In 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram for $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. After the original founders departed, Instagram increasingly began to resemble Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Instagram has become a primary reason for Facebook's continued relevance, outside of memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Pattern of Imitation
Facebook and Instagram have a history of [[social_media_platforms_and_content_imitation | imitating features]] from smaller apps to maintain relevance:
*   **Vine**: Facebook introduced 15-second looping videos in 2013 to compete with Vine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Snapchat**: Facebook attempted to buy Snapchat for $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, and later directly copied its "Stories" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This significantly impacted Snapchat's user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **BeReal**: Instagram is currently testing a dual-camera feature, mimicking BeReal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **TikTok**: Facebook previously launched a standalone TikTok clone app called Lasso, which failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Subsequently, Instagram integrated "Reels," replacing all video uploads with the Reels format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. There is now a dedicated Reels tab in the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## The "Make Instagram Instagram Again" Movement
The public discontent culminated when influential figures like Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian reposted an artist's message, Tati Brunning, which stated, "Make Instagram Instagram Again. I'm starting a movement. Let's bring back the old Instagram" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This post received approximately 2 million likes, and a Change.org petition gained 300,000 signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Key demands from the petition included:
*   Bringing back chronological timelines to see friends' posts in order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   An algorithm that favors photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   A platform that listens to creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

However, the speaker notes that the idea of Instagram always being about "living in the moment" and sharing "best moments in real time" is false, as it has always been a "vain vanity app" where users put forward curated versions of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The loudest complaints often come from those with significant financial stakes in the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Instagram's Response and Rationale
Instagram's CEO, Adam Mosseri, addressed the backlash, stating that the full-screen feed was a test for a "more fun, engaging experience" and that they would continue to support photos as part of their heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. However, he admitted that "more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, citing a natural shift in user consumption towards video due to improved bandwidth and mobile service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

Mosseri also discussed "recommendations" (posts from accounts users don't follow), framing them as a way to help users discover new content and for [[potential_for_new_content_creators_on_tiktok | creators to reach more people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. He mentioned that users can "X out" recommendations or use a separate "following feed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.

The speaker critiques Mosseri's statements as PR-approved messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. The shift to prioritizing video makes the platform more engaging, leading to longer usage times and increased ad views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. Recommendations are a way to keep users on the app longer when their friends don't post enough content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. The "following feed" is seen as a concession, not a default, similar to how [[youtube_algorithm_and_channel_content_strategy | YouTube has de-prioritized subscribers]] in favor of an algorithmic home feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

## Impact on Creators
The shift has a significant [[impact_of_instagram_changes_on_users_and_creators | impact on creators]], especially photographers, who find it harder to reach their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Instagram now prioritizes Reels, reducing the visibility of photos. A tally showed that 50% of the posts on the speaker's feed were Reels, and 80% of those Reels were suggested content, not from friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

Photographers feel compelled to create "cringy reels" to get their art seen, rather than focusing on photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. James Charles, a social media personality, articulated this by stating that creators are "forced to post video" because the performance of photos has plummeted, leading them to switch to video not out of desire but out of necessity for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

The speaker expresses concern that the platform is forcing [[content_creation_strategies_on_tiktok | content creation strategies on TikTok]] onto users who traditionally created photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This dramatic shift directly impacts creators, forcing them to change their entire content direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

## The Profit Motive
Instagram's primary motivation for this shift is profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. The company aims to make the app as profitable as possible for its shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. They see a "huge opportunity" in emulating TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. Instagram has no inherent loyalty to its users; its allegiance is to revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. If cooking videos became the most profitable content, Instagram would pivot to prioritize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

New Instagram users are being born every day, and the more the platform can "hook" them to stay on the app longer, the more valuable those users are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. This means users who become "addicted to Reels" and consume Instagram like television are more valuable than "fair weather users" who might leave due to changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

## Conclusion
The speaker acknowledges that while creators and users are unhappy, Instagram will likely continue its shift towards video content, as it appears to be a successful strategy for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. [[youtube_content_and_video_production | Content creators]] are beholden to platforms and their algorithms, often needing to adapt to new formats like Reels to maintain visibility and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. While the impact on photographers is negative, the speaker hopes for future ways to prioritize photo creators without forcing them into video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. Ultimately, if Instagram no longer serves users' needs, another app will emerge to fill the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

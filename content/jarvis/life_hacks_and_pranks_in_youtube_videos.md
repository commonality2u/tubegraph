YouTube channels like "123 Go!" create content featuring various [[life_hacks_and_diy_projects_in_fabiosa_videos | life hacks]] and pranks, often appearing on trending lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The channel "123 Go!" gained 1.6 million subscribers by February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Inspirations and Comparisons
"123 Go!" is described as an attempt by the creators of "5 Minute Crafts" to emulate "Troom Troom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. "5 Minute Crafts" is known for "bad weird [[life_hacks_and_diy_culture | life hacks]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, while "Troom Troom" combines "weird [[life_hacks_and_their_practicality | life hacks]] and pranks" with characters and voice-overs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, a blend that "123 Go!" seems to adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Despite their popularity, these videos are often perceived as strange and pointless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## "Relatable" Situations
One video from "123 Go!", titled "Relatable situations anybody can recognize", was a top trending video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. However, viewers found its scenarios highly unrelatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The videos often feature language that is "the uncanny valley of language", making them uncomfortable to watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Examples of Unrelatable Scenarios:
*   **Piping Mishap**: A "piping mishap" is portrayed as a significant issue, like a clogged toilet, which the host finds incompatible with the term "mishap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Spider Incident**: A character's reaction to seeing a face-sized spider is to pack a suitcase, get clothes from the "crime scene" (the room with the spider), and leave the apartment for "two, three days" to check into a hotel, hoping the "hideous thing" dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This is considered bizarre, as the character conveniently places her suitcase in the same spot the spider was seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Dishwashing**: A character finds a sink full of dirty dishes and decides to wash only one mug, then struggles to wash a spoon, which somehow causes a large amount of water to spray her face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This is humorously dubbed "the true piping problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Broken Nail**: A character with false nails struggles to pick up a coffee pod with her nails, even though the practical approach would be to use the side of her finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Grocery Trip**: A character performs push-ups to warm up her muscles before carrying all her groceries into her apartment in one trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The groceries appear to be from an "Enterprise rental car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## Pranks and DIY Projects
The "123 Go!" channel also features [[impact_of_pranks_on_youtube | pranks]] and DIY segments, similar to "Troom Troom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. They often use keyword stuffing in titles, such as "seven funny DIY school pranks easy pranks for back to school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### Examples of School Pranks:
*   **Play-Doh Gum Prank**: This prank involves cutting Play-Doh with an exacto knife into a square and placing it in an empty gum wrapper to trick someone into thinking it's gum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Critics question the use of a box cutter for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a> and the impracticality, as gum typically has paper wrapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Soy Sauce Coke Prank**: This prank involves mixing Sprite and soy sauce in a glass to mimic the appearance of Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The result is a dark, foul-smelling concoction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. The intended victim drinks it without noticing the taste or smell, which is deemed unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **Carrots in Chocolate Box Prank**: This prank involves replacing chocolates in a box with carrots and a "peak ripe" banana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. The prankster waits for an extended period for someone to take the bait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. The victim is then surprised to find the healthy snacks instead of chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

## Common Criticisms and Observations
*   **Narrator's Voice**: The voice-over in "123 Go!" videos often changes tense or addresses the characters directly, creating confusion and an "unsettling" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Target Audience**: The content often raises questions about its intended audience, as scenarios like a child skipping town or needing an "adult-sized suitcase" to flee a bug in their solitary apartment seem inappropriate for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Lack of Realism**: The videos frequently depict scenarios that are not physically possible or are highly illogical, leading to [[humorous_consequences_of_following_life_hacks | humorous consequences of following life hacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **Uncanny Valley**: The overall style of the videos, including the language and situations, creates an "uncanny valley" effect, making viewers uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Production Environment**: The settings often appear to be sound stages with plain white backgrounds, indicating a controlled, artificial environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Ages of Characters**: The characters' ages are ambiguous, with some appearing like adults engaging in "childish" pranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

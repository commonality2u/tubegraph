Relationships, in their myriad forms, often provide ample material for humor, especially when they venture into the unusual or perplexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. From inanimate objects to bizarre domestic arrangements, the internet is a rich source of [[humor_in_relationship_discussions|humorous relationship discussions]].

## Unconventional Bonds

Not all relationships are romantic or even with living beings. One notable example includes a self-proclaimed relationship with a candle named Kevin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Beyond personal connections, humorous or [[unusual_relationship_stories|unusual relationship stories]] can be found widely online, often going viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Examples of such viral stories include:
*   A "wholesome relationship" between a deaf cat and a vacuum cleaner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   An "adversarial relationship" between "Kidz Bop Karen" and a video's subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   The "weird relationship" of Kanye West and his family, particularly a Halloween costume choice where Kanye was a dinosaur instead of Barney alongside Betty Rubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## [[weird_relationships_on_reddit|Weird Relationships on Reddit]]

The `/r/relationships` subreddit is a frequent source of "ridiculous viral" stories that often defy belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Despite the strange scenarios, the community is described as supportive for those seeking advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### The Game of Thrones Spoiler Ex

One notable example involves a man who cheated on his girlfriend, leading her to unblock him every week to send him Game of Thrones spoilers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While presented as a form of accountability, the ex-boyfriend reportedly didn't understand why people wouldn't want to help him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### The "Yawn-Stealing" Boyfriend

A story that inspired much discussion involved a boyfriend who began putting his mouth to his girlfriend's to "inhale the yawn" she exhaled, calling it "giving him my yawns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Initially seen as silly, this behavior escalated, with the boyfriend becoming "upset" or "offended" if she didn't allow him to "take" her yawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. He would ask if she was "hiding [her] yawn from him" if she covered her mouth or turned away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### The Physicist and the Philosopher

Another Reddit post detailed a marriage between a physicist and an academic philosopher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The philosopher husband expressed displeasure that his physicist wife hadn't "seriously engaged" with his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. His work, however, contained "embarrassingly" wrong claims about physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. He would "mansplain" concepts like physics to her, despite her expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Further complications arose from his obsession with 19th-century German philosopher Hegel, whose framed picture he kept on their nightstand and even as his phone background, replacing a picture of his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He would use philosophical jargon without explanation and dismiss his wife with incorrectly pronounced German phrases, despite her being a native German speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### The Magician's Restaurant

A particularly unique story involved a husband who wanted to quit his job and use all family savings to open a restaurant "for magicians," inspired by a new friend named Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The envisioned restaurant would feature magical props like levitating tables and bending cutlery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Meals could include a specific playing card secreted inside, and waiters would always name the "7 of hearts" if asked to think of a card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The idea was to allow men on dates to impress companions with seemingly spontaneous tricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The wife noted her husband had no prior interest in magic until meeting Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. The husband argued he should be allowed to follow his dreams, believing the idea was good because Chris, a magician, came up with it and "magicians are smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This story is presented as a potentially real, albeit bizarre, problem that might even involve a "spell" from Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

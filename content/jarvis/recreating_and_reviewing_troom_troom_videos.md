## Introduction: A Return to Troom Troom
The holiday season, typically a time for reflection and spending time with loved ones, was chosen as an opportune moment to reconnect with [[troom_trooms_reputation_and_content_style | Troom Troom]], a DIY channel known for its "ridiculous" and "useless" life hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The content creator had previously covered the channel in a video titled "Troom Troom is the Worst Channel on YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Recent developments revealed that Troom Troom is not operated like a traditional company, but rather is the "result of the collective mind," according to a *Box Profile* article that interviewed the creator as a "thought leader in hating Troom Troom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Feeling he hadn't given the channel a "fair shake," the creator decided to put Troom Troom to the test by [[following_a_troom_troom_cooking_tutorial | following one of their tutorials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Choosing the Tutorial: "DIY Giant vs. Miniature Christmas Candy"
The chosen video for this experiment was "DIY Giant vs. Miniature Christmas Candy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Troom Troom is renowned for its clickbait thumbnails, and this video's thumbnail was particularly absurd, featuring a giant gingerbread man from Shrek "chilling with redhead" while she paints his mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The creator recognized this as clickbait but decided to attempt to recreate the giant gingerbread man anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## The Gingerbread Man Recipe Attempt
The Troom Troom video presented a recipe that initially appeared to be a genuine cooking tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Ingredient Gathering and Initial Steps
The recipe called for five ounces of butter and the same amount of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
Challenges began immediately:
*   **Sugar type**: The recipe appeared to use white sugar, but only brown sugar was available, raising concerns about ruining the recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Measurements**: Difficulty in measuring brown sugar from the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Melting butter**: Instructions to melt butter in a bowl that was not microwave-safe (metal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Honey**: Significant trouble extracting five ounces of honey from its bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The honey had to be microwaved to loosen it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Eggs and Spices**: Two medium-grade double-A eggs were added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, followed by one teaspoon of cinnamon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a> and one teaspoon of ground ginger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Dough Preparation
Twenty-five ounces of all-purpose flour were gradually added to form the dough, which became very thick and required kneading by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. The dough's consistency was noted to be like Play-Doh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Without construction paper for a stencil or a rolling pin, the creator free-handed the gingerbread man shape and used a water bottle to flatten the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Baking and Initial Results
The gingerbread man was baked for 20 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. A mistake was made by attempting to put wax paper, rather than parchment paper, into the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

Upon removal, the gingerbread man's color was confusingly lighter than the raw dough, and it had a "boil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. It was soft and seemed like something was forgotten in the recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. The taste was described as "horrible," "burnt," and like "cardboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

## Creating the Giant Gingerbread Man
To achieve the giant size depicted in the thumbnail, it was decided the gingerbread man would need to be built in parts due to pan size limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

*   The head was made from the leftover dough of the first, "old formula" batch, resulting in a "very dark head" from being baked too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   For the limbs, a new batch of gingerbread dough was made, with altered ingredients in an attempt to improve the taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. This second batch was significantly stickier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Chilling the dough was attempted, but it did not help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

### Assembly with Gummy Bear Cement
The challenge of assembling the parts into one piece arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Melted gummy bears were used as "cement" to attach the arms and head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This process was difficult, leading to complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

## The Final Reveal and Taste Test
Once assembled and decorated with runny icing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, the giant gingerbread man was carefully transported to the couch to recreate the Troom Troom thumbnail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

The final product was described by one friend as a "badly burned beach dolphin" and caused another roommate to scream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. While it stood on the couch, the heat from the lights caused the icing to melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. The gingerbread man was so heavy it felt like "plank from Ed Edd and Eddy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. It was speculated that the dough wasn't kneaded long enough, making it super dense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

The final taste test of the second batch confirmed it was "better but not by much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. It still tasted like "hard wood" or "cardboard with a hint of cinnamon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

## Conclusion: Troom Troom's Recipes and Expectations
It was concluded that the recipe's poor taste made "perfect sense" because Troom Troom likely doesn't expect anyone to actually attempt to cook or try anything from their videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Comparing it to other gingerbread recipes, it was evident that crucial ingredients like molasses were missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. The result was a "very structurally sound gingerbread with little thought to its taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Despite the inedible outcome, the process of following along was fun, indicating that the entertainment value of Troom Troom's videos is present, even if their practical application is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

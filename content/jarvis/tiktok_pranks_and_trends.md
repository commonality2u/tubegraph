TikTok, an app known for its diverse content, has gained significant traction. The platform's content ranges from memes to various forms of entertainment, including pranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Some initial attempts to gain [[TikTok community dynamics and meme culture | TikTok fame]] involved using a "horrifying emoji avatar" and referencing the "Hit or Miss" meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Nature of TikTok Pranks

A prank is generally defined as a harmless trick played on a friend, leading to a shared laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. While TikTok has a reputation for people gaining fame by imitating existing songs and comedy bits, suggesting a lack of talent or creativity, the speaker believes there's much nuance and interesting content on the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, when it comes to pranks, the speaker notes that they often lack creativity and vary from "fake to real to real and fake somehow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Prominent TikTok Pranksters

### Jackson O'Doherty and Kristen Hanley
These two Australian "bros" specialize in a blend of pranks and challenges, often involving one friend saying a random phrase, like "get rid of it," leading the other to perform an obnoxious public disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

For example, a common scenario involves destroying food, such as throwing a freshly made Subway sandwich on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The reactions of the pranked individuals often suggest surprise, yet an understanding of what they are expected to do, as if under some "cloud chasing version of the Imperius curse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Other "get rid of it" instances include throwing a glass bottle of liquor, potentially injuring those nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, or even destroying an Apple Watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> and flushing money down a toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. They also film pranks like ruining clean shoes by dousing them in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> and committing what appears to be tax evasion by throwing tax documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

The speaker notes that these [[popular_tiktok_pranksters | popular TikTok pranksters]] are also prominent on Instagram, where they display "flexing" and sometimes harass people while in jockstraps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Imitators and [[trends_in_tiktok_relationships | Relationship Pranks]]
Jackson and Kristen have many imitators, including a couple who proposed to each other through a prank, involving the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Many of these videos use hashtags like #funny and #friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Michael Fallon TV
This individual considers himself a comedian among [[popular_tiktok_pranksters | TikTok pranksters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Content Advisory
> One of his "comedy sketches" is titled "when you pick up a disabled hitchhiker," which the speaker states is "worse than you're imagining" and is unable to show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

His other pranks include:
*   **"That friend who's always on their phone"**: Involves throwing a friend's phone into oncoming traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **"That friend who wants to tan for ten more minutes"**: Involves dragging a friend, who is tanning on a boardwalk, into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **"How to stop someone from eating unhealthy"**: Involves throwing someone's food away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **"How to stop someone from over exercising"**: Involves disrupting someone's workout by throwing a barbell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

The speaker highlights the near-instant reaction time to these dares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## The Challenge of Good Pranks

The speaker observes that it is very difficult to create a good prank, as it involves many variables, including the target's sense of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Pranks can easily become harassment if they go too far, or boring if they are too tame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

A personal anecdote illustrates the danger of pranks: college friends were suspended for sending a harmless April Fool's email from the Dean, advertising a fictional testing program from "Aperture Science" (from the *Portal* game) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Despite the risks, people continue to create pranks, often motivated by the prospect of gaining [[TikTok community dynamics and meme culture | TikTok followers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Other [[commentary_on_tiktok_trends | TikTok Prank Trends]]

The speaker shares examples of other [[life_hacks_and_pranks_in_youtube_videos | pranks]] on TikTok that range from "way too intense and comically underwhelming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>:

*   **Pasta Cracking Prank**: A popular prank involves chewing on raw pasta to simulate bone cracking sounds, often done in public places like grocery stores to gauge reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Public Disturbances**:
    *   Playing loud music (like "Hit or Miss") over a Walmart intercom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
    *   Destroying a friend's phone after taking it from their pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   **"Accidentally Murdering Your Sibling"**: A prank involving cracking someone's neck with pasta to simulate injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Vegetable Oil Prank**: One creator used a bottle of vegetable oil to prank a roommate who was celebrating a non-existent Fortnite win, resulting in oil being spilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   **Spilling Wine Prank**: Another prank involved intentionally spilling wine on a friend's clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker finds these pranks generally "dumb" and questions the motivation behind them, suggesting people undertake such risks for a "hit of that sweet sweet dopamine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. They also reflect on feeling "old" and not finding pranks funny anymore, wondering if this is a normal sentiment at 27 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

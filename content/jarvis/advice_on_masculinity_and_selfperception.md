Online platforms, particularly TikTok, are presented as a source for understanding women and [[the_concept_of_alpha_males_and_their_beliefs | alpha male]] worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, the narrator expresses immediate skepticism about getting advice from TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. There is a recognition that [[the_concept_of_alpha_males_and_their_beliefs | alpha male]] pickup artists are not new, and new [[the_concept_of_alpha_males_and_their_beliefs | alpha males]] frequently emerge online to share their perspectives with followers who may wish to emulate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The narrator has read that [[the_concept_of_alpha_males_and_their_beliefs | alpha males]] don't exist and that their advice can be a scam to take advantage of vulnerable followers, potentially being [[the_harmful_effects_of_trying_to_be_an_alpha_male | harmful]] and scaring women away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Zay Double Edge's Relationship "Game" and Masculinity Advice

The video focuses on "Zay Double Edge" (dbe), an individual with a book titled "Stop Getting Left On Red, Get Nudes Instead: Rules, Tips, and Strategies to Become an Elite Texter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. His advice, presented as "game," includes:

*   **Not taking women seriously** In the early stages of a relationship, men should not take women seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. He suggests that a "real woman" would almost have to "beat you up" to be taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Viewing relationships as a "game" is meant to be fun; otherwise, it can lead to hating women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Recognizing perceived manipulation** Zay claims that women use "manipulation strategy" by posting indirect pictures on social media to make it seem like they are with another guy after a breakup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. This is presented as a "test" of how "weak" a man is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. A "strong dude" will not say anything, and by staying silent, the woman will "come back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. If a woman is truly done, she won't try to manipulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Critique of American men** Zay asserts that American women are "hard to deal with" and "arrogant" because the average American guy is "programmed to be a simp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **"Dying on principles"** A man should "stand on principles" and "say whatever the f*** you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. He states that "real men don't let women tell them what a real man is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, and that a man should "die on his principles, right or wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, comparing this to historical figures like MLK, Malcolm X, and even Osama Bin Laden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
*   **Women's emotional nature and resilience** Women are described as "emotional beings" who feel deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. A heartbreak for a woman is said to hurt as much as grieving over someone's death, causing them to "break like glass" and never fully recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Women's past and "programmability"** Zay argues that a woman's past "matters," contrary to what "beta males" might say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. He claims that if a man treats a woman like a "queen" when her previous partners "programmed her that she should not be treated that way," she cannot appreciate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. He explicitly states that "women are programmable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.
*   **Signs of being "thirsty"** Signs a man is "thirsty" (desperate for sex) include:
    *   Complaining about one's love life, hoping for pity sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
    *   Still having problems with women despite "learning game" (advice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.
    *   Not knowing what questions to ask a woman because of being "thirsty for sex" and not caring who she truly is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.
*   **Core masculinity principles** Zay outlines principles he believes fathers should teach:
    *   "Never go to a man asking for a favor with an empty hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. He suggests that asking for more free advice when he's already giving it is "beta male" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>, and that he can tell "when a dude is raised in a feminine ass household" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.
    *   "Never tolerate disrespect from anyone," preferring to "be put six feet under than to be disrespected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. He states that a "female can't teach you" this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.
    *   Always be "alert" and "never walking around with your head down" to avoid being an "easiest one to get robbed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
*   **Suppressing emotions** A man should "never express his feelings" when a woman is "begging" him to, as this shows that he "buckles as a man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. Expressing emotions makes a man a "beta male simp mangina" because the woman feels "insecure and powerless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.
*   **Man's struggle versus woman's inherent value** Zay claims that "when a woman is born, she's already born a princess," on the "highest of the pedestal," while a man is not born a "prince or a king" and "has to make himself a prince or a king" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. He adds that "nobody give a f*** about us" (men) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>, and that men are depressed and unsuccessful because they've become "a victim of the microwave age" â€“ scared to take risks or what others think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. Happiness for a man comes from "thriving in discomfort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.
*   **Women's "unique ability" and attraction metrics** Women have a "unique ability to be able to be in tune with the emotional and spiritual world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>. A woman's attraction level can be measured by "how compliant she is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>. When a woman starts to comply, her "feminine nature will make her like you because she doesn't have free will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. Lastly, "goofy men are not attractive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

## Narrator's Self-Reflection and Conclusion

The narrator frequently expresses disbelief and confusion about Zay's advice, questioning its source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>, consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>, and extreme nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. The narrator reflects on their own experiences, such as sharing their love life with a friend without wanting "pity sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>, and feeling emotions deeply despite Zay's implied criticism of such behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. They also poke fun at Zay's statements, like relating "programmable women" to a computer science degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>, and the "microwave age" leading to the decision to get rid of their microwave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the narrator decides not to become an [[the_concept_of_alpha_males_and_their_beliefs | alpha male]], finding it "too hard" and noting that women "don't even like them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>. The decision is made to "be myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a> and to give others "permission to be whatever you are," stating that "you don't have to change," "you're doing just fine," and "you get to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. They also add a final piece of advice: "don't manipulate people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.

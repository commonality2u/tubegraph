> The commentary about reality show "characters" is based on their portrayal and edited actions within the show. It is explicitly stated that viewers should not harass or engage with the real people discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Background and Show Premise
[[The concept and criticism of Love is Blind as a dating show | Love Is Blind]] is a "marriage game show" where individuals date and get engaged after communicating only through a wall, without seeing each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Contestants then simulate cohabiting at a resort before returning to the real world, with pressure to marry within three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## On-Show Personality and Actions
Shake is portrayed as "concentrated misogyny" with an "Alpha bro" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Despite the show's premise of finding love without physical sight, Shake repeatedly expressed a need for physical attraction, often making comments about women's sizes and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. He preferred dating younger women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> and seemingly scared away most potential partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. His primary profession is a veterinarian, but he also identifies as a house DJ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Relationship with Deepti
Shake formed a connection with Deepti, sharing a similar cultural background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Initially, the show's editing suggested a potential "change" in him due to this relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. However, this proved to be false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Shake consistently disrespected Deepti behind her back, stating he did not feel physically attracted to her and comparing her to his aunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. He is described as running a "smear campaign" against Deepti, who was considered a "saint" throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Even Shake's mother sided with Deepti, expressing pride in Deepti and disappointment in her son, stating Deepti deserved someone who gave her 100% effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### The Wedding Day
At the wedding, Deepti chose not to marry Shake, stating she deserved someone who was "sure" and was "choosing herself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Shake, seemingly embarrassed, quickly brushed off the rejection and immediately wanted to "party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Reunion Behavior and Confrontations
Shake's behavior at the reunion is described as a "guttural yelp"-inducing spectacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Self-Report and Victim Mode
His initial concern at the reunion was about how he would be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, which was seen as a "self-report" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. He quickly entered "victim mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Antagonism Towards Cast and Hosts
*   **General Disdain:** The entire cast showed "disdain" for Shake, especially as he began speaking, due to his prior comments and actions not shown on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Interruption and Meddling:** Shake frequently interrupted other contestants and inserted himself into their relationships, offering unsolicited opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. He even told Shane, another contestant, to "shut up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, despite being an avid interrupter himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   **Misunderstanding the Show:** Shake repeatedly articulated his belief that the show was not about finding a wife or skipping steps in a relationship, contradicting the core concept of [[The concept and criticism of Love is Blind as a dating show | Love Is Blind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. He later conceded that he might be wrong about the show's intention but maintained his "takeaway" was different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **"Meta-Reality TV Villain":** He acknowledged the show was a "farce" and didn't take it seriously, raising potentially interesting points about the show's "experiment" concept, but his "deplorable" persona made his arguments disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Absorption:** During a montage of his disrespectful comments, Shake was observed "beaming" and "gleaming" with self-absorption, indicating a lack of remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
*   **Marriage as a Purchase:** Shake explicitly compared marriage to making a "huge purchase," emphasizing the importance of a specific physical body type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. He maintained his focus solely on physical attraction, even when discussing serious relationship aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.
*   **Confrontation with Hosts:** Co-host Vanessa Lachey directly challenged Shake about why he joined the show, given his strong preference for physical attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. She "broke frame" and "went in on Shake," berating him for his physical critiques of women on the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. In response, Shake stated the "only person I'm attracted to in this room is Vanessa Lachey," suggesting her anger was "kind of hot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   **"Love is Blurry":** He coined the term "Love is Blurry" as an alternative to "Love is Blind," suggesting he wanted to be "partially blind" in the dating process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **"We're animals":** Shake attempted to justify his focus on physical attraction by stating, "We're animals," to which Nick Lachey retorted, "You treat animals, we're human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. This exchange highlighted Shake's tendency to "feed off of being insulted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

### Deepti's Final Confrontation
Deepti confronted Shake at the reunion, stating it's acceptable not to be physically attracted to someone, but his "way you go about life" and how he expresses it is "extremely disrespectful" and "degrading to women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. She received praise for "carrying herself like an absolute Queen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

## Post-Show Presence
After the show, Shake's Instagram became a "dumpster fire," filled with "Shake was right propaganda" and posts claiming he "tell[s] it like it is" and "speak[s] the truth that nobody else wants to hear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. He frequently reposts an account that is suspected to be run by himself, pretending it's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. His online posts included sentiments like "You didn't harm anyone, you hurt people with honesty" and complaints about censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. He had also previously posted about starting an "Alpha bro podcast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Initially, the app [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]] was often viewed as "cringy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The creator's first intention was to download the app, find cringy videos, react to them, and declare [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]] "the worst app of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, the actual experience was "so much weirder" than anticipated, leading to a "[[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]] wormhole for like three straight days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## TikTok's Core Identity

[[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]] is described as a social video sharing app with numerous features for editing videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Its primary early use was for lip-syncing and creating "cute" content to gain likes and become the next "Jacob Sartorius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Much of the app's content can feel like "thirst traps for preteens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, which can be unsettling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Direct Comparison to Musically and Vine

A popular understanding of [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]] is that it's "literally just musically turned into vine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
Initially, the app's original purpose was to lip-sync to songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, which aligns with Musically's primary function.

### Shifting Towards a "Vine Vibe"

After spending more time on the app and tailoring the algorithm by liking content, the creator observed a change in the feed:
> "it's somebody starting to give me a bit of a vine vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>

This indicates a shift from solely lip-syncing to more diverse, meme-driven content. However, it's also noted that, similar to Vine, "there are a lot of people missing the mark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> in their content creation.

## Evolution of Content and Meme Culture

What once was a "haven for cringy but ultimately harmless children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> has evolved into a "den of honestly hilarious memes in irony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This evolution shows [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]] developing its own distinct meme culture, though many memes initially felt repetitive, often variations of the "I want to be tracer" trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

As the creator continued to watch, the memes became "stronger and more self referential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, leading to a point where the entire app seemed to be dominated by memes and references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. This echoes the sophisticated [[tiktok_community_dynamics_and_meme_culture | meme culture]] that developed on Vine, where understanding context was key to appreciating the humor.

## Potential for New Creators

Drawing a parallel to Vine, it's questioned if [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]] could also be a platform where new stars emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. There appear to be creators who might "do this more seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>, especially if they gain viewership, encouraging them to take content creation more seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite initial discomfort, the creator found enjoyment in [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]], particularly due to the community's unpredictable and "weird stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. While the app may seem repetitive with similar jokes, it's recognized that this is often "how memes work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Overall, [[evolution_and_cultural_impact_of_tiktok | TikTok]] is deemed an "interesting internet moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>, capable of being entertaining while also presenting challenges related to content and platform safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. It's perceived as not "the worst" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a> and has the potential for new talent, much like Vine before it.

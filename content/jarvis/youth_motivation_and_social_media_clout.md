The desire for social media [[impact_of_online_fame_and_popularity_on_content_creation | clout]] has significantly influenced youth behavior, particularly through trends circulating on platforms like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. This motivation can lead to participation in risky activities for public attention and online fame.

## The "Devious Licks" Trend

A prominent example of this phenomenon is the "devious licks" trend, which emerged on TikTok around September 6th, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. The trend involves students stealing items from schools and publicly showcasing their "licks" (stolen goods) on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. The term "devious lick" combines "devious," meaning mischievous, and "lick," a slang term for something stolen or spoils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

### Evolution and Escalation
The trend began with a TikToker posting a video pulling a hand sanitizer dispenser from a backpack, celebrating it as an "absolute devious lick" shortly after schools reopened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This initial video, featuring an item stolen during a pandemic, was considered "devious indeed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

The trend quickly escalated, with thousands of similar videos appearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. While initial thefts included common items like soap dispensers, mirrors, and Expo markers, they soon progressed to more expensive items such as projectors, smart boards, and microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. Some instances even involved outright vandalism, like removing sinks or causing flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>. The language used to describe these acts also escalated, from "devious lick" to "profoundly scandalous lick" and "truly malevolent lick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

## Motivation for Clout

The primary motivation behind the "devious licks" trend is the [[impact_of_online_fame_and_popularity_on_content_creation | clout]] that can be gained from going viral on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Participants openly brag about their thefts, often by feverishly opening a JanSport backpack to reveal the stolen item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This public display, despite the risk of being caught, highlights the strong pull of online recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

Some theories for this behavior connect to the long period of distance learning during the pandemic, where students were separated from social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Stealing and posting could be a way for them to release frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, and perhaps feel like "criminal masterminds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## Consequences and Reactions

The widespread adoption of the "devious licks" trend has led to severe consequences for schools and students:
*   **Bathroom Closures** Many schools have had to close bathrooms due to stolen soap dispensers, mirrors, and even urinals, impacting hygiene and student access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Strain** Repairs and replacements for stolen items (like Chromebooks, smart boards, and even signs) cost schools valuable, often limited, resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. This exacerbates the existing issue of criminally underfunded public schools, potentially leading to further budget cuts for essential items supplied by teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.
*   **Disruption** Some schools have canceled homecomings or returned to online learning due to the severity of the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Teacher Impact** Teachers have reported taking measures like keeping classroom cameras on to protect personal investments (books, supplies) they bought for students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. Some teachers express a dilemma, understanding the desire to "stick it to administration" while also needing to protect their resources and ensure student safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.

School administrations have responded with emails, announcements, and threats of legal action, emphasizing the financial and practical consequences of the vandalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. They have also set up anonymous tip lines to encourage students to report those participating in the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>. However, arguments based on "school spirit" or the negative impact on the school environment are often ineffective, as students driven by [[impact_of_online_fame_and_popularity_on_content_creation | social media clout]] may not relate to these concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.

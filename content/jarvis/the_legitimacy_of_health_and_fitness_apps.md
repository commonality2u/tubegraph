The Dimmick Facebook page, known for its "inspirational/motivational quote memes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> and questionable viral stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, also branched out into the health and fitness app market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While the Facebook page itself posted "random fact and health videos" like "easy ways to treat rounded up or back" and "eating chocolate is good for women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>, questions arise about the legitimacy of a Facebook meme page providing health advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

## The Dimmick Fitness App

The Dimmick fitness app's existence is perplexing, as it shares nothing in common with the Facebook page's content or iconography, save for the rapper's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. Despite its health and fitness claims, the app has a low two-star rating on the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a> and is curiously rated for ages four and up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>.

### Deceptive Practices and User Experience

The Dimmick app employs practices that raise [[ethical_concerns_with_mobile_gaming_and_gambling | ethical concerns]], particularly its [[misleading_mobile_game_ads | misleading]] nature regarding subscriptions.

*   **Immediate Paywall:** Though advertised as free, opening the app immediately presents a paywall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.
*   **False Free Trial:** The app offers a choice between yearly or monthly subscriptions and claims to provide a "7-day free trial" with the yearly option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. However, this trial does not exist, and users are charged immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:08">[01:48:08]</a>.
*   **User Reviews:** Nearly all negative reviews for the app highlight users being scammed out of money, typically around $100, due to the non-existent trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.
    *   Users reported being "charged my account and didn't give me the option to cancel prior to the seven days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>, and "charge me during the free trial period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>.
*   **Developer Response:** The developer responded to one such review, feigning ignorance and directing the user to an email address that proved to be non-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>.

### Ineffective Content

Beyond the scam, the app's actual fitness content is also highly questionable:

*   **Unclear Instructions:** Upon starting a workout, the app immediately counts down "3, 2, 1, go" without prior explanation of the exercises, such as squats or double taps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a>.
*   **Fast Pacing:** Users barely have time to understand an exercise before the 30-second interval is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.
*   **Lack of Promised Features:** Smoothie recipes were advertised in the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>, but were nowhere to be found within the app itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:08">[02:02:08]</a>. The advertised smoothie video on YouTube had only nine views, all from the investigating party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Dimmick fitness app represents a "large content operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a> that "cheats people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a> through its misleading free trial offer and ineffective fitness content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The channel's stated mission to "create the best video content in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> contrasts sharply with its engagement in "sketchiest tactics known to man" and "outright scamming people out of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>.

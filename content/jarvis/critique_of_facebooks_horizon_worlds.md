Meta Horizon Worlds, Facebook's version of the [[metaverse_technology_and_design_challenges | metaverse]], has faced significant criticism and challenges since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Despite Citibank valuing the metaverse at $13 trillion and Mark Zuckerberg investing $36 billion, the platform has struggled with low user engagement and minimal revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. At one point, it reportedly had only 38 users and gained just $470 in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While actual user numbers are higher, they are not sufficient to justify the massive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Initial Impressions and User Experience

Upon entering Horizon Worlds, users are met with a clunky setup process, including numerous software updates and a required rebranding of accounts from Oculus to Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The game's name, "Meta Horizon Worlds," is described as terrible, fitting for a "terrible game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Google searches for "Horizon Worlds" yield questions like "is Horizon world still available?" and "why did Horizon Worlds fail?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Visuals and Avatar Design
The graphics in Horizon Worlds are subpar, described as "what on Earth is this?" despite Mark Zuckerberg's $36 billion investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. They are compared unfavorably to Wii Sports, notably lacking legs for avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Users instead slide around with floating torsos, which is "very unnerving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Zuckerberg's later "reveal" of legs in October 2022 was found to be misleading, as the legs shown were not real-time tracked but rather an animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

### Movement and Comfort
Default movement settings are stiff and can cause "weird tunnel vision," leading to motion sickness for some users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Even after adjusting settings, natural movement can induce nausea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Demographics and Social Environment

Despite being rated for teens, many avatars do not look like teens, and the platform is frequently overrun by children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The comedy club, for instance, was found to be full of pre-teens using slurs and offensive jokes, resembling a "middle school cafeteria" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Even "18-plus" worlds like bars often have children present, as there are no effective mechanisms to keep them out beyond potential ridicule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. One bar attempted an "anti-child technology" using arm span measurement, but its effectiveness is questionable for short adults or tall teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

The scarcity of adult users, particularly during daytime hours, contributes to a sense of loneliness and isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Social interactions can be awkward, with conversations feeling like "high school" where everyone already knows each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. The platform excels at "emulating the social anxiety I feel when I don't belong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

## Content and Engagement Issues

Most worlds are "empty at all times," with the few populated ones often being "overrun by infants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

### Mini-games and Repetitive Activities
Horizon Worlds is "filled to the brim with janky mini games and balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Basketball, in particular, appears in nearly every world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. Object interaction is often buggy, making activities like bowling or picking up virtual items difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### Corporate Presence and IP
Unlike platforms like VR Chat or Fortnite, which leverage popular intellectual property, Meta Horizon Worlds features limited corporate partners. The only notable official partner is Wendy's, which has an empty "Wendy-verse" world from a promotion in April 2022 that was still present in July 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Unofficial brand worlds exist, like "Disneyland VR parody," which is a legal loophole to avoid copyright infringement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

### Creator Economy
While some users, like "Simi bro," develop worlds as a full-time job and are part of Meta's partner program, the reported creator donations of $470 per month suggest creators are likely paid directly by Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

## Conclusion
The platform is described as a "strange strange place" that is "not fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. The core issues stem from its low, primarily child-dominated user base, repetitive activities, and technical limitations like the lack of legs for avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. The claim of 200,000 monthly users is questioned as misleading, with reality closer to a few hundred active users in featured worlds at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. The overall experience indicates that "this version of the [[metaverse_technology_and_design_challenges | metaverse]] takes off" is highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

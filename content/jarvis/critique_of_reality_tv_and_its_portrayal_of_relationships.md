The Bachelorette, a spin-off of *The Bachelor*, is presented as a marriage game show where contestants are meant to find "true love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The format involves approximately thirty individuals, "carefully selected copies of exactly the same person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, competing for the affection of a single person they have only known for about nine weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The show maintains a symbiotic relationship with *The Bachelor*, often featuring contestants from one show as the lead in the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This season features Hannah B, a past contestant from *The Bachelor* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Critiques of the Show's Premise and Format

The show is consistently described as "dumb," with each season seemingly dumber than the last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. There is an expectation that a show about marriage would feature "marriage-worthy contestants," but this is rarely the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Instead, the contestants are often portrayed as "bad and also very dumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, leaving the lead surrounded by "the worst guys in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

[[critiques_on_reality_tv_show_formats_and_stereotypes | The show is known for its cringeworthy introductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, with one example being a contestant arriving in a sloth costume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Many contestants receive minimal screen time, making their eliminations surprising to viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Portrayal of Contestants and Relationships

### The "Villain" Archetype: Luke P

Luke P, a dominant figure this season, is characterized as a "five nine Bible study leader with an anger management problem" and "Napoleon energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, also noting that he "looks like a bitmoji" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. He is seen as having "no redeeming qualities" other than being religious, which Hannah B seems to find appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

Luke P's behavior is frequently criticized:
*   He is described as "super manipulative and awful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, using his religion to shield himself from criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   During a rugby game, he "randomly bodyslams" another contestant, Luke S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, despite Luke S not having the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Producers allegedly added a punch sound effect to the scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   He attempts to justify his actions by claiming self-defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, and Hannah B surprisingly takes his side, leading to Luke S's elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   When Hannah B tries to eliminate him, Luke P refuses to leave the set, stating he didn't get a rose but Hannah still "wants me to be here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   He exhibits disrespectful behavior by putting "baloney in somebody's lap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> and being easily aggravated, leading others to troll him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   During fantasy suites, he tells Hannah B she shouldn't sleep with any other guys, claiming it's "not what a good Christian girl would do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. He threatens to leave if she admits to sexual intimacy with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   After Hannah B finally eliminates him, he still refuses to leave, stating he "doesn't respect [her] or [her] boundaries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   He makes repeated, uninvited returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, expressing unsettling thoughts like "she's sadly mistaken" and "I'm on my way and I'm coming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This behavior is likened to "serial killer vibes" and "harassment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   He even appears with an engagement ring, implied to have been provided by producers for drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   His refusal to leave is depicted as "so upsetting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, with other, physically larger contestants eventually stepping in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

[[discussion_on_toxic_dynamics_and_bullying_in_reality_tv | The show is criticized for subjecting Hannah to "emotionally manipulative situations for so that it could be the most dramatic season yet"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The show's complicity in "condoning his toxic behavior" is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Luke P is later called a "narcissistic cantankerous misogynist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, and Hannah B feels compelled to apologize to "Bachelor Nation" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

### The "Musician" Archetype: Jed

Jed is presented as a musician, constantly talking about his career and singing "bad" songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. There's a perceived double standard, as another contestant was eliminated for discussing his business, while Jed's self-promotion was allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Jed openly admits to Hannah B that he initially came on the show for his music career, but then "fell in love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

Despite this, everyone around Hannah B, including his own family, tells her that Jed is only there for his music career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. His family expresses doubt about his readiness for marriage due to his music pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. His most significant accomplishment is a "dog food jingle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

After winning, an article reveals Jed had a serious girlfriend whom he "ghosted" to be on the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. He denies their relationship, despite traveling together, meeting her family, and telling her he loved her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. He is also accused of bragging about winning the show instead of being engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>, and partying with models in his hotel room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

## Broader Critiques of the Reality TV Model

[[critique_of_dating_show_premises | The Bachelorette is criticized for pretending to help people find love]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>, but in practice, it's "just another reality show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. It is seen as more dishonest than shows like *Real Housewives* because it attempts to present itself as a "polished thing" rather than embracing its true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

[[criticisms_of_the_shows_approach_to_dating | The show increasingly features ridiculous situations where people do not get married]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. While the community and content surrounding the show can be entertaining, the show itself is seen as lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. It lacks self-awareness, especially by fixating on and condoning toxic behavior like Luke P's for an entire season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. The show often backtracks on its initial decisions, attempting to condemn problematic contestants only later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. A key suggestion for improvement is to avoid casting "awful people" in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.

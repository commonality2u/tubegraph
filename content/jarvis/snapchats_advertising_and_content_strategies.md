Snapchat's approach to content and advertising has evolved significantly, particularly with its Discover feature. While the platform initially aimed to separate content from personal relationships, its current strategy relies heavily on curated publisher content and frequent advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Evolution of Snapchat Discover

[[snapchat_discovers_evolution_and_issues | Snapchat Discover]] is highlighted as the platform's unique feature, alongside Bitmoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Initially, Discover was envisioned as a platform for major media companies like National Geographic, ESPN, and CNN, aiming to garner respect within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

However, its current state is characterized by low-quality, clickbait content, described as "the worst clickbait known to man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Examples include a mix of serious topics like coronavirus updates next to "kissing tips" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Snapchat has increased investment in these Discover shows due to their success, particularly after a significant financial hit attributed to a tweet by [[impact_of_kylie_jenner_on_snapchats_business | Kylie Jenner]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Despite the investment, the content quality is often criticized:
*   Shows like "Five Minute Crafts" and "Slick Fades" (haircuts) are prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Much of the content is repurposed from other parts of the internet or collections of random Snapchat stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   The content is often "recycled from other parts of the internet and then reformatted badly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   The Dobre Brothers' show, for instance, features videos not originally shot for Snapchat and poorly reframed for the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   The "Phony Texts" series is cited as a low-effort example, consisting of fake iMessage conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

The lack of personalization in recommendations is also noted, with shows that have been watched still being difficult to find, and generic beauty tutorials continuing to be suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This has led to a perception that Snapchat has "no identity" and resembles a "BuzzFeed homepage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

## Advertising Strategy

Snapchat generates revenue through advertisements placed within its Discover content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. These ads are described as "frequent and just like haphazardly strewn about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Due to the short nature of Snapchat content, there are no natural pauses for ads, leading to their abrupt insertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This strategy aims to appeal to the widest audience imaginable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

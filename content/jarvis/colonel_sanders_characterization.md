From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The [[kfc_lifetime_movie_crossover | KFC Lifetime Movie Crossover]] entitled *A Recipe for Seduction* aims to characterize Colonel Sanders as an appealing figure to promote chicken sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The marketing strategy for the film was to portray Colonel Sanders as "hot now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Appearance and Profession
In *A Recipe for Seduction*, Colonel Sanders, whose given name is Harland Sanders, is introduced as a chef hired by the Mancera family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. He was formerly the head chef at a restaurant called "Le Petit Pomplemu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The character is played by Mario Lopez, whose hair was painted gray to depict the Colonel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. His age is portrayed as confusingly ambiguous, appearing either old or prematurely gray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Personality and Actions
Harland Sanders is depicted as a suave, romantic interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Despite being a chef, he acts somewhat unprofessionally, leaving food shipments unattended for an impromptu date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. When asked to tell his story, he immediately focuses on his "secret recipe" for chicken, rather than personal history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

He is presented as compassionate, handsome, ambitious, attractive, funny, a great cook, with a stable career and "cool hair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. He forms an "amazing connection" with Jessica, the film's protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

A recurring character trait is his strong aversion to being called "crouton," which implies a possible backstory or sensitivity to the term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Role in the Plot
Harland serves as the romantic foil to the villain, Billy Garibaldi III <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. He is initially confident and confronts Billy, refusing a monetary offer to leave Jessica alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Later in the movie, he is bound and gagged by Billy and Bunny (Jessica's mother), and needs to be rescued by Jessica, adopting a "damsel in distress" role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. Despite the dramatic kidnapping, he appears to give up easily given how loosely he is tied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

Ultimately, Colonel Sanders and Jessica get married a year after the events of the movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

Influencer marketing leverages individuals or organizations with established credibility and audience reach to promote products or services. This can range from direct sponsorships to brand partnerships with content creators.

## Direct Sponsorships: Scentbird Example

An example of direct influencer marketing is the sponsorship by Scentbird, a monthly subscription service offering new designer fragrances for both women and men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For $15 a month, subscribers receive a 30-day supply of scents like "Fortitude" by Robert Graham or "Luna Rossa" by Prada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Customers can also upgrade for extra products monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Promoters often provide a promo code for discounts, such as 30% off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Content Farms and Brand Partnerships

Content farms, like Blossom, represent a different facet of digital influence. They create "pointless content to harvest clicks for views," similar to "5 Minute Crafts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Blossom's video, "Is your food fake or real? Find out with these 16 easy tests at home!", achieved 100 million views on Facebook alone and went viral on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This video, described as "half fake," was reportedly the most viewed video on Facebook in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

These entities leverage their massive online reach to secure "grand partnerships" with brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. For example, Blossom, with its 51 million follower Facebook page, produces ads for various brands, including teeth whitening products and "health apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

### Case Study: Health App Commercial

One Blossom-produced commercial for a "health app" depicts a scenario where a man experiences chest pain during a date and uses the app to self-diagnose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The ad concludes with him relieved by the app's assessment and kissing his date, suggesting that using the app can lead to positive social outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. The ad promotes an app that allows users to ask health questions and diagnose themselves at the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

### Critique of Influencer Content and Trust

The content created by platforms like Blossom is often characterized as "completely fake or... extremely misleading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. For instance, claims about processed cheese not melting well or rice being mixed with plastic are unsubstantiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Similarly, the idea that baby food contains "ground up rocks" or that a magnet test indicates bad food is misleading, as essential minerals like iron are magnetic and beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

The objective of these content creators is primarily "clicks," not necessarily consumer awareness or accurate information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. This highlights the importance of consumers being "vigilant about what's in our feed" rather than solely what's in their food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

The YouTube channel 123 Go! is frequently criticized for its strange, unrelatable, and illogical video scripting and storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The channel, which gained 1.6 million subscribers since February, is perceived as the creators of *5-Minute Crafts* attempting to mimic *Troom Troom* by combining "weird life hacks" with characters and voice-overs, resulting in "the strangest," most "pointless YouTube channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Uncanny Valley of Language and Relatability

A central [[critical_commentary_on_video_tutorials | critique]] of 123 Go!'s scripting is its profound lack of relatability, despite videos explicitly claiming to feature "Relatable situations anybody can recognize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The content is described as the "most Unrelatable video I've ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, so bizarre it "constitutes at least a war crime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

A recurring issue is the "uncanny valley of language," where nothing "fits quite the way it's supposed to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Examples include:
*   Calling a clogged toilet a "piping mishap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, which is deemed "so incompatible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   A character's first reaction to a large spider being to grab bug spray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, or packing a suitcase to flee to a hotel, only to pack it near the "crime scene" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This scenario extends illogically beyond a simple joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   A character's dramatic reaction to a splash of water while washing dishes, prolonged for an "unnecessary" amount of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   A woman with false nails struggling to pick up a coffee cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, leading to questions about her experience with nails and the logical force applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Inconsistent Narration and Plot Progression

The "voice of God" narration in these videos is consistently criticized for making "no sense whatsoever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The tense frequently changes, with the narrator sometimes speaking as the character and other times speaking about the character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. For example, a character states, "Looks like I got more stuff than I could carry," followed by the narrator asking, "Do you think Olivia can do this all in one trip?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This leads to confusion about the narrator's role and who they are addressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, reminiscent of *Dora the Explorer* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

The plot progression is often nonsensical, with scenarios escalating into situations "no human is ever experienced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. A segment showing a character doing push-ups to "warm up those muscles" before carrying groceries from an *Enterprise* rental car is deemed completely unrelatable to the act of grocery shopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Unrealistic Pranks and DIYs

When discussing the channel's prank and DIY videos, described as a "copy of Troom Troom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, further issues with [[storytelling_and_narrative_styles_in_viral_content | storytelling]] emerge:
*   A prank involving cutting Play-Doh with an exacto knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> raises questions about the target audience, as it implies "kids with box cutters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   A "prank" involving mixing Sprite, soy sauce, and Coke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a> is criticized for its unappetizing nature and unrealistic execution; the smell alone would give it away, making it impossible for someone to drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. The visual description of the mixture as "that dark color" is also noted as an odd, vague descriptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   A "prank" involving swapping an attractive chocolate box for one filled with rotten bananas and carrots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a> is seen as impractical due to the obvious difference in weight and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, and the premise of waiting for someone to "take the bait" for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a> is considered absurd.

The overall [[storytelling_and_narrative_techniques_in_fabiosa_videos | storytelling]] in these videos is marked by a disconnect from reality, prompting questions about the characters' ages and motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, and the purpose of the strange scenarios. The setting often feels like a sound stage, further detaching the content from any semblance of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

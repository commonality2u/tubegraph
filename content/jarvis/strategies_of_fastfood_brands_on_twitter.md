Many fast-food brands on Twitter have adopted unusual habits to appear "hip and with-it" and appeal to a younger audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This approach often results in humor, but can also be very strange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Wendy's: The Pioneer of Roasting

Wendy's is considered a major player in this strategy, with their tweets often going viral and influencing other brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

Their strategy involves:
*   **Aggressive Roasting**: Wendy's gained significant attention for roasting both fans and competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. A notable exchange occurred when a user challenged Wendy's "fresh, never frozen" beef slogan, leading to Wendy's highlighting the user's forgetfulness about refrigerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   **Public Reaction**: This behavior led to widespread celebration, with titles like "25 Wendy's tweets that served a double shade burger in 2017" and "Wendy's social media team smells blood, pounces on wounded wildebeest McDonald's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Controversy**: While seemingly harmless, the act of a multi-million dollar corporation "dunking on a regular ass person" can be weird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Many of the tweets Wendy's replied to were deleted, making Wendy's appear to be harassing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. By 2018, people were actively begging Wendy's to roast them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **[[rise_of_meme_culture_among_fastfood_brands | Meme Status]]**: Wendy's has achieved [[rise_of_meme_culture_among_fastfood_brands | meme status]], engaging with viral trends such as the "surgery on a grape" tweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, streaming Fortnite to destroy in-game freezers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, and even releasing a mixtape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **[[brands_as_people_marketing_strategy | Brands as People]]**: This strategy positions Wendy's as a "quirky friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, despite being a corporation with thousands of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

## Burger King: Imitation and Brand Interaction

Burger King is another major brand adopting a similar strategy, often challenging Wendy's for dominance on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

Their approach includes:
*   **Customer Roasting**: Burger King also engages in "absolutely destroying their customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. For example, in response to a complaint about missing cheese on a burger, Burger King replied with "pro tip if you want cheese on your whopper use your words of the counters Burger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Awkward Meme Usage**: They awkwardly use Kardashian memes and have tweeted "absolute gibberish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
*   **Brand Interactions**: Other brands, like Netflix and Pop-Tarts, frequently interact in the replies of such brand tweets, creating an illusion of brands as friends at a "school lunch table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Feuds**: Brands also engage in "beefing," often inventing drama to attract attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Examples include a "rap battle" between Wendy's and Wingstop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>, and Burger King's one-sided beef with McDonald's, such as offering free Whoppers if ordered at a McDonald's using their app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

## Beyond Fast Food: Products as People

This [[brands_as_people_marketing_strategy | marketing strategy]] has extended beyond fast-food chains to various other products, embracing a [[brands_using_social_media_for_relatable_content | relatable content]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

*   **Pop-Tarts**: The Pop-Tarts Twitter account tweets in the first person, engaging in "relationship problems" humor, such as "beautiful kind of like my ex JK it's beautiful unlike my ex I was always too good for you bye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
*   **Hot Pockets**: Hot Pockets adopts the persona of a "stoner cousin," with tweets like "hot pockets without hot are just pockets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. The strategy seems to be designed to appeal to users who are "scrolling through their feed while high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.
*   **MoonPies**: This 100-year-old snack brand unexpectedly became a "certified memelord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>, sharing absurd tweets like "stick a moon pie in the microwave light a couple of candles and scream into a soft pillow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. They also engage in flirty exchanges with Wendy's and roast their fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

## Steak-um: The Meta Brand

Steak-um, an obscure frozen beef product, stands out for its highly self-aware and almost anti-corporate Twitter presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

*   **Self-Awareness**: Steak-um actively criticizes typical brand Twitter behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. In one instance, in response to Wendy's "national roast day," Steak-um challenged both Wendy's and MoonPies with "let's see if you can turn our frozen beef sheets in a roast beef you corporate cowards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.
*   **Anti-Corporate Stance**: Their tweets rarely focus on the product itself, instead offering meta-commentary on the nature of brand social media, such as "brand posts out-of-touch content critics stupid brand this meme is ancient brand post trending content critics stupid brand how do you do fellow kids brand post-ironic self-aware content critics stupid brands stop being aware and destroying the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.
*   **Cult Following**: Steak-um has garnered a cult following for its self-critical approach, even when mainstream media criticized it for being too self-aware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>.

## Why This Strategy Works

This [[marketing_strategies_and_viral_trends_in_social_media | marketing strategy]], making brands act like "sad Millennials," has proven effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.

*   **Relatability**: By adopting human-like personas and engaging in humor, brands become relatable to young people, particularly Millennials, who may feel isolated, burdened by debt, and seeking connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. They flock to brands on social media for "love, guidance, and attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
*   **Engagement**: This leads to increased [[impact_of_social_media_engagements_by_brands | social media engagements]], growing follower counts (e.g., Wendy's almost 3 million followers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>, and boosting business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. The entertainment value of these ads makes them more palatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.

## Potential Harms and Broader Context

While entertaining, this type of [[the_role_of_brands_in_social_media | brand behavior]] can have negative implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.
*   **Hiding Misconduct**: Companies could potentially engage in "shady" practices and hide behind their "cartoon mascot" personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. For example, some have pointed out that while Wendy's boasts about "fresh never frozen beef," they might also "slave forever potatoes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.
*   **Advertising as Culture**: Advertising is deeply ingrained in society, as seen in historical examples like the diamond engagement ring trend, which started as a 1930s advertising campaign and evolved into culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.
*   **Overall Impact**: While some might argue this type of advertising "poisons our culture," it is viewed as a less significant concern compared to broader societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.

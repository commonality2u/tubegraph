[[content_farms_on_facebook | Facebook content farms]] operate by constantly producing videos, often achieving high view counts shortly after posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A notable example of this phenomenon is the page "Dimmick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Dimmick's Operational Profile

Dimmick is a Facebook page boasting 12 million followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. They post approximately 10 times a day and have maintained this frequency for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The name "Dimmick" may be a play on "epidemic," suggesting the widespread nature of their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Content Strategy and Quality

Dimmick's self-proclaimed mission is "to create the best video content in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. However, their main page primarily features "inspirational/motivational quote memes" that are often confusing and potentially offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   "Be happy with what little you have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, which can be interpreted as nagging or invalidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   A confusing metaphor about a journey to heaven with "humanity as our passport" and "love as our visa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   A comparison of oneself to the sun and moon, incorrectly stating the moon shines on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Memes seemingly designed to guilt-trip children, such as "appreciate the food your mother cooks for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Direct threats like "careful what you tell people a friend today could be an enemy tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

The English used in these memes often suggests the writer is not a native speaker, a common trait for these [[content_farms_on_facebook | content farms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Crucially, none of these memes are unique to Dimmick; they are all plagiarized, identical across numerous other pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This mass [[social_media_platforms_and_content_imitation | content imitation]] is a significant aspect of their operation.

### Video Content
Dimmick's "videos" are often simple "pictures that move around a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. They tell stories, often with bizarre plots and morals:

*   **"A Blind Man's Love"**: This story describes a man who marries a beautiful girl, who then develops a "skin disease" (freckles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. After he loses his eyesight in an accident, their married life continues happily because he cannot see her "ugliness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The story culminates in his wife's death and his reveal that he was only pretending to be blind to spare her pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The morals presented are inappropriate, such as "sometimes it is good for us to act blind" or "ignoring the little harsh things in life can make your life easier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Colonel Sanders Motivational Story**: Another video, with 11 million views, purports to be a motivational story about KFC founder Colonel Sanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This story, however, is a plagiarized and fake [[viral_meme_pages_and_their_impact | viral meme story]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Health and Fact Videos**: The page also features videos with "random fact and health videos," such as "easy ways to treat rounded up or back," "eating chocolate is good for women," and "banana facts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Trusting a Facebook meme page for health advice is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## The Connection to Jersey Dimmick

The Facebook page's URL is `facebook.com/JerseyDimmick` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, leading to the discovery of playlists containing music videos by someone named "Jersey Dimmick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Facebook's Page Transparency feature reveals the geographic locations of page managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. For Dimmick, it shows managers in the US (7 people) and Kosovo (5 people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. For Jersey Dimmick, it shows managers in the US (3 people), India (1 person), and also Kosovo (5 people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This overlapping management confirms that both pages are run by the same individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Jersey Dimmick confirmed his ownership of the Dimmick meme page on Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Monetization and Scams

The operation monetizes through several channels:

*   **Exclusive Content Subscription**: Users can subscribe to "exclusive content" for $5 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **"Dimmick Fitness App"**: This app, unrelated to the content of the meme page in terms of iconography, uses the rapper's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Scam Practices**: The app, despite being free to download, immediately presents a paywall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. It falsely claims to offer a 7-day free trial with a yearly subscription; however, users are charged immediately upon sign-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Numerous negative reviews confirm that users were scammed out of money, often $100, due to the non-existent trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Developer responses to these complaints often link to a non-existent email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
    *   **App Content**: The app itself is poorly designed, with instant workout starts and confusing 3D models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Advertised smoothie recipes are missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

## Ethical Concerns and Hypocrisy

The Dimmick operation is a large [[content_farms_on_facebook | content farm]] employing at least five people in Kosovo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. While framed as a "side hustle" to finance a music career, it engages in widespread content plagiarism and outright scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

The most significant problem is the page's hypocrisy: it maintains a "highest moral stance" in its content while employing "sketchiest tactics known to man" and "outright scamming people out of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the [[corporate_humor_and_communication_on_social_media_platforms | corporate humor]] and [[marketing_strategies_involving_humor_and_memes | marketing strategies involving memes]] seen on other platforms.

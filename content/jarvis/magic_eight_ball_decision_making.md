A life hack suggests using a Magic Eight Ball to make every single decision, especially for those who are indecisive and ponder choices for hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The core principle behind this hack is "no more thinking, just shake the ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

The host of the video reveals that this "hack" is something they have personally practiced their entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Tools for Decision Making

The host showcased their personal collection of decision-making tools:
*   **Hello Kitty Eight Ball** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>
    *   When asked, "Are we the best of friends?" it responded, "Don't count on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Buzz Lightyear Eight Ball** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>
    *   When asked, "Am I the man?" it replied, "Sensors read no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Mr. Predicto** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
    *   This device is designed to predict things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. When questioned, "Mr. Predicto, are you having a good time?" it answered, "It is a strong possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Later, when asked if the peanut M&M hack was a success, it responded, "Yes, without question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, and later "The answer is unclear, try again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

This life hack is deemed a "success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

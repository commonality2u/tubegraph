[[Fabiosa and its content creation style | Fabiosa Better World]] is described as a content farm that appears to be generated by artificial intelligence aiming to create viral Facebook content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Its content ranges from "life hacks" to "ridiculous moral stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, with a particular focus on sensationalized narratives.

## General Narrative Characteristics

The stories presented by Fabiosa often lack a conventional [[Storytelling and narrative styles in viral content | narrative structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. They are likened to a dream where scenes shift illogically without clear transitions or explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This rapid pacing and lack of context are significant aspects of their [[Critique of video scripting and storytelling | storytelling style]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Extreme Situations and Sensationalism

[[Sensationalism in digital storytelling | Fabiosa videos]] frequently depict extreme scenarios and bizarre events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The use of over-the-top situations and character backstories is a key technique to evoke emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, even if these situations are illogical or manipulative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Case Study: "My mom-in-law gave me a concrete bath"

This story, initially seen in a shorter TikTok version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> and later in a longer Facebook/YouTube version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, exemplifies Fabiosa's narrative quirks:

*   **Implausible Premise**: The central event involves a mother-in-law attempting to encase the bride in concrete before her wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This is presented as an "attempted murder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Rapid, Illogical Transitions**: Within three hours of the wedding, the bride is nearly cemented, rescued, broken out, given a bizarre makeover (involving a fish tank and watermelon rinds), and then everything turns out "great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The original TikTok version provides only two seconds for the concrete bath scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Unanswered Questions**: The story leaves many questions, such as the mother-in-law's motivations, how the "concrete bath" was logistically achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, and why the mother-in-law would then participate in the bride's makeover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Details**: The bride's phone, which was supposedly dead, is used for a "pocket dial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. The story's events are often out of sync with the narration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Lack of Character Development**: Characters are often unnamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> and their motivations are shallow, relying on extreme situations for emotional impact.

## Case Study: "Women are made for washing dishes"

This [[Moral lessons and storytelling techniques | Adar Man-style video]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, titled with a sexist premise, is intended to be a tale of a woman overcoming workplace underestimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>:

*   **Exaggerated Harassment**: The new female hire is subjected to extreme harassment, including having a rat planted by the shop foreman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, tools replaced with purse items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, and being taped inside a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The stake for her enduring this is the threat of losing custody of her son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Plot Inconsistencies**: The protagonist, despite being a "car genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, initially fails to fix a car, leading to her firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The male mechanics are never shown working, only eating pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Manipulative Backstories**: The antagonist, "Bud," is given multiple severe ailments (sick daughter needing chemotherapy, appendicitis) to elicit sympathy and justify his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Every character in Fabiosa videos often has a "ridiculous sob story backstory" to create quick emotional manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Questionable Moral**: The implied [[Moral lessons and storytelling techniques | lesson]] is to "sacrifice yourself and your needs for the guy at work who harasses you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Lack of Naming**: The female protagonist, despite being central to the story, is only referred to as "lady brains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, and by the end, even her name is taken over by the male character's name, "Bud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Narrative analysis of fake stories | Fabiosa's storytelling]] relies heavily on [[Sensationalism in digital storytelling | sensationalism]] and dramatic, often illogical, scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. They prioritize shocking events and extreme emotional manipulation through exaggerated backstories over coherent plots or developed characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This approach aims to create quick, viral content, regardless of narrative consistency or believability from the [[Viewers perspective on family narratives in online videos | viewer's perspective]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The videos, particularly shorter ones from platforms like [[Content creation strategies on TikTok | TikTok]], often leave significant plot holes and unanswered questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

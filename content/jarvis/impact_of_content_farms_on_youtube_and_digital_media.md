These operations often lack original production quality, actors, or set pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Facts Verse

Facts Verse is presented as a prime example of a content farm operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

### Characteristics of Facts Verse
*   **Massive Reach** The channel boasts approximately 5 million subscribers on YouTube and 2 million on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Since its launch on September 16, 2015, Facts Verse claims to have gained over 1.6 billion viewers and 3.7 million subscribers on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **Content Format** Facts Verse primarily creates list videos and news story videos, frequently focusing on birth stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Content Quality and Accuracy**
    *   **Inaccurate "Facts"** The content provided by Facts Verse ranges from opinion to outright incorrect information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. For instance, a video claimed the loop on the back of a shirt would cause wrinkles if used to hang it, which is false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. Another video incorrectly stated that the iconic clock tower in a "spot the difference" puzzle was in Tokyo, Japan, when it was clearly London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Harmful Advice** Some content can be directly harmful, such as advising users to charge a flash drive with a phone charger box or plug anonymous USB drives found embedded in walls into their laptops, which could lead to viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Poor Research** The facts presented appear to be poorly researched, possibly sourced from subreddits like "Today I Learned" and "WTF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Visual and Thematic Content** The channel features grotesque thumbnails and triggering topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Mission Statement** Facts Verse states its primary goal as "to educate and entertain" their fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. However, their YouTube channel description contains only a message about copyright issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

### Content Plagiarism and Recycling
Facts Verse frequently lifts content directly from other sources, including other [[Content farming and mass production on YouTube | content farms]] and online forums:
*   A video titled "10 Things You Did Not Know What They Are" featured the exact same list found on Bright Side's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. This list was also found on Catfly.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.
*   Another video titled "Photos to Test Your Intelligence" used the exact same list of images found in a Lifebuzz article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.
*   Facts Verse also directly plagiarized a BuzzFeed list titled "18 Awful Lies Around Daily Use Objects That Will Make You Second-Guess Everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. While BuzzFeed's list also compiles content from Reddit, Facts Verse simply narrates it without significant curation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.

### Consequences for Digital Media

*   **Copyright Infringement** The reliance on "stealing other people's content" raises significant copyright concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Despite potentially facing copyright claims, these channels can still generate substantial revenue from monetizing stolen content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.

With the launch of Disney+ at midnight on November 12, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, the streaming service has brought back many nostalgic films and is introducing new original series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Among these new offerings are spin-offs like one for Star Wars' Boba Fett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> and a reboot of Lizzie McGuire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Most notably, Disney has rebooted [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical]] in a unique way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, different from how [[high_school_musical_3_plot_and_review | High School Musical 3]] attempted to introduce new characters to replace the original cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## High School Musical The Musical The Series (HSM TM TS)
The new series, officially titled [[high_school_musical_the_musical_the_series | High School Musical the Musical the Series]], is a mockumentary that takes place at the actual high school in Salt Lake City, Utah, where the original [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical]] movie was filmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Within the show's universe, [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical]] is a movie, and the school where it was shot had surprisingly never staged a production of *High School Musical the musical* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The series follows theater kids as they put on a showing of [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical]], making it a very meta experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

It is difficult to watch the show without having seen the original [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical]], as the original film is the entire premise of the series and is frequently referenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Character Parallels
The series introduces a new cast of talented teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, unlike the original [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical]] where Zac Efron did not sing in the first movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The new characters often mirror their original counterparts:

*   **Ricky**: An 18-year-old skater boy who dislikes musicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. He is the "Troy boy" of the series, destined to play Troy in the musical, despite never having seen [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Like Troy, he doesn't initially want to be in the musical but does so to get the girl, and is often late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Nini**: The "Gabriella" of the cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. She's a quintessential theater kid who has never had a leading role, having only played background parts like a tree or the back of a cow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Big Red**: Ricky's best friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. His name is casually used, and he's compared to Toby from *The Office* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **EJ Caswell**: The closest thing to a "basketball boy" in the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. He's Nini's new boyfriend, co-captain of the water polo team, and senior class treasurer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Gina**: An experienced theater professional who transferred to East High specifically for the musical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. She is seen as the "Sharpay" of the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Episode 1: Initial Comparisons and Plot Points
The first episode opens with the new drama teacher, Miss Jen, watching the [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical]] movie in the school parking lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This scene immediately sets the meta-tone of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The beginning of the show also mirrors the original movie's opening, with best friends skating to class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

A key plot point in the first episode is the strained relationship between Ricky and Nini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Ricky had suggested they "take a break" during the summer while Nini was at theater camp due to his fear of commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Nini then began dating EJ Caswell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Ricky, out of jealousy, decides to audition for the musical to get closer to Nini, despite his dislike for musicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

During auditions, Ricky bursts in late, mirroring Troy's tendency to stumble into situations late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. While Nini auditions, singing incredibly, the auditorium lights short out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Ricky and EJ use their phone lights to illuminate her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Ricky then auditions by singing Nini's song from Instagram, not a song from [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

The first episode concludes with Ricky and Nini being cast as Troy and Gabriella, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, upholding the [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical]] tradition of "unqualified" people getting the lead roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

## Overall Impression
The show is surprisingly good, especially considering reboots can often be disappointing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. [[high_school_musical_the_musical_the_series | High School Musical the Musical the Series]] successfully reboots the franchise for a new audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. It is genuinely funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, and the premise works well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. The cast is talented, and the show balances content for both kid and adult audiences, ensuring it appeals to long-time [[high_school_musical_movie_plot_and_review | High School Musical]] fans and new viewers alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. The show is self-aware and effectively uses its source material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

The episode-by-episode release schedule allows the show to breathe and foster a community around its viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. There is hope for at least one cameo from the original cast in future episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

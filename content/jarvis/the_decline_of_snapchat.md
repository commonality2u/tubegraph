Snapchat, once a trailblazer in social media, has faced a significant decline, losing its unique identity and struggling to compete with other platforms that have adopted its pioneering features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Loss of Core Identity

Originally, social media users expressed frustration when photos and videos from friends were mixed with content from publishers, creators, and influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:10]</a>. For many, friends represent relationships, not just content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:14]</a>. Snapchat initially offered a solution by focusing on ephemeral content shared among friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

However, the app's key innovations—disappearing photos, wacky face filters, and "stories"—were subsequently replicated by other social media platforms, most notably [[history_and_evolution_of_instagram | Instagram]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:01:05]</a>. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook reportedly attempted to acquire Snapchat, and upon refusal, [[history_and_evolution_of_instagram | Instagram]] proceeded to incorporate many of Snapchat's best features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:29]</a>. This widespread adoption of its core functionalities has left Snapchat struggling to define what makes it distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Despite employing leading experts in computer vision and machine learning for features like face filters, many users capture photos on Snapchat only to share them on other platforms like Twitter and [[history_and_evolution_of_instagram | Instagram]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:59]</a>.

## [[impact_of_kylie_jenner_on_snapchats_business | Kylie Jenner]]'s Impact

A notable turning point in Snapchat's perceived decline was a tweet from [[impact_of_kylie_jenner_on_snapchats_business | Kylie Jenner]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:28]</a>. Her statement about not opening Snapchat anymore was attributed to wiping out over a billion dollars in the company's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:30]</a>. While the entire stock drop might not be solely due to her tweet, it highlighted a significant shift in user engagement, with even [[impact_of_kylie_jenner_on_snapchats_business | Kylie Jenner]] herself reportedly no longer using the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Rise and Fall of [[snapchat_discovers_evolution_and_issues | Snapchat Discover]]

To compete with platforms like [[history_and_evolution_of_instagram | Instagram]] and [[influence_of_apps_like_tiktok_on_instagram | TikTok]], Snapchat leaned into [[snapchat_discovers_evolution_and_issues | Snapchat Discover]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:11]</a>. Initially intended to garner respect through partnerships with major media companies like National Geographic, ESPN, and CNN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:04:11]</a>, [[snapchat_discovers_evolution_and_issues | Discover]] has since transformed into a "magical place" dominated by "the worst clickbait known to man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:30]</a>. This shift is seen as an attempt to recover revenue, especially after the financial impact of the [[impact_of_kylie_jenner_on_snapchats_business | Kylie Jenner]] tweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:44]</a>.

Examples of content on [[snapchat_discovers_evolution_and_issues | Snapchat Discover]] include:
*   Sensational headlines juxtaposing serious news (e.g., coronavirus updates) with absurd content (e.g., kissing tips) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Channels featuring mundane activities like haircuts ("Slick Fades") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   Shows that are simply repurposed or low-effort content from other parts of the internet, often badly reformatted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Content Examples on Discover

#### Dobre Brothers Show
The Dobre Brothers, known for their YouTube content, also have a Snapchat show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:06:02]</a>. Their content, such as pranking a girlfriend by freezing her MacBook, is criticized for being unfunny and demonstrating a disconnect from reality, especially given their bio stating they "live life like there's no tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:07:01]</a>. The videos are often not shot for Snapchat's vertical format, leading to poor framing and zooming into irrelevant parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:27]</a>. The pranks often feature accomplices who feign surprise, revealing the staged nature of the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:08:14]</a>. The "destruction followed by replacement" prank format (e.g., destroying a laptop then buying a new one) is also critiqued for not addressing the loss of irreplaceable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:20]</a>.

#### Phony Texts
"Phony Texts" is described as one of the lowest-effort series on [[snapchat_discovers_evolution_and_issues | Discover]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:21]</a>. It consists of fake iMessage conversations with "fake people," using only text rather than animated or live actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:38]</a>. The narratives are often bizarre, featuring unrealistic scenarios like a man harassing a coworker with "serial killer" texts, only for it to be revealed as a ploy for a "sympathy date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:16:36]</a>. The content is interspersed with aggressive, frequent ads, often featuring celebrities like Kris Jenner for games like "Coin Master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Advertising on Discover
[[snapchats_advertising_and_content_strategies | Ads on Snapchat]] are frequent and "haphazardly strewn about" due to the short, fragmented nature of the content, lacking natural pauses for ad placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Loss of User Experience

The personalized experience on [[snapchat_discovers_evolution_and_issues | Snapchat Discover]] is lacking; recommendations do not change, and it's difficult to find shows that have already been watched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:09]</a>. This lack of personalization and the overwhelming presence of low-quality content contribute to the feeling that Snapchat has lost its identity, resembling a "BuzzFeed homepage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:30]</a>. For many, Snapchat was once a favorite app for sharing ephemeral memories and "goofs" with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:46]</a>.

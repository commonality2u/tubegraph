[[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]] franchise, despite being recognized as a "bad [[critique_of_the_bachelor_as_a_television_show | TV show]]" by its audience, reached a new low point during Matt James's season due to its handling of racial issues and controversies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Casting the First Black Bachelor

Traditionally, [[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]]'s lead is a [[contestants_and_relationship_dynamics | contestant]] from a previous season of [[overview_of_the_bachelor | The Bachelor]] or [[analysis_of_the_bachelorette_and_its_contestants | The Bachelorette]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. However, [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | producers]] broke this formula for [[narrative_analysis_of_matt_james_as_the_bachelor | Matt James]], casting him as the first Black Bachelor despite him not having been a [[contestants_and_relationship_dynamics | contestant]] on a prior season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. While this was a significant step, the show failed to adequately address the pressures [[narrative_analysis_of_matt_james_as_the_bachelor | Matt]] faced as the first Black Bachelor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Rachel Kirkconnell Controversy

A major controversy erupted during [[narrative_analysis_of_matt_james_as_the_bachelor | Matt James]]'s season when rumors and photos emerged of [[contestants_and_relationship_dynamics | contestant]] Rachel Kirkconnell attending an antebellum-themed sorority party in Georgia in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Celebrating the antebellum South, a period defined by slavery, was deemed a "bad look" and caused public outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Chris Harrison's Defense and Backlash
In an attempt at "damage control," long-time host Chris Harrison defended Rachel Kirkconnell's behavior in an interview with Rachel Lindsay, the first Black [[analysis_of_the_bachelorette_and_its_contestants | Bachelorette]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Harrison questioned whether attending such a party was "not a good look in 2021" versus 2018, implying a difference in social understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. He also suggested that "50 million people did that in 2018," employing an "everybody was doing it" defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

This interview sparked significant backlash, leading to Rachel Lindsay being harassed off Instagram for calmly explaining the flaws in Harrison's logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Similarly, [[narrative_analysis_of_matt_james_as_the_bachelor | Matt James]] also had to delete his Instagram posts due to harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

### Producer Responsibility
It was questioned whether the [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | producers]] knew about Rachel Kirkconnell's past before casting her, suggesting a potential pattern of casting individuals with "questionable history" for ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The handling of the controversy was criticized, noting that a similar incident with Hannah Brown attending an antebellum party was resolved without major [[producers_role_in_creating_drama_on_the_bachelor | drama]] by simply deleting the photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Matt James's Journey and the Aftershow

During the "After the Final Rose" special, hosted by Emmanuel Acho, [[narrative_analysis_of_matt_james_as_the_bachelor | Matt James]] discussed the pressures of being the first Black Bachelor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. He expressed that he broke up with Rachel Kirkconnell because they were "coming from different life experiences" and he didn't want to be the one to "teach her what it's like to be Black in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

Rachel Kirkconnell later explained that she didn't realize the significance of the antebellum photos until people discussed it online, which prompted her to learn why it was upsetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. Emmanuel Acho attempted to distinguish between "racist behavior" and "racially insensitive behavior," though it was noted that the distinction often doesn't matter to those on the receiving end of the behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

## Overall Critique

The season was criticized for its "bad" production, with [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | producers]] spending most of their time on [[producers_role_in_creating_drama_on_the_bachelor | petty drama]] rather than developing [[contestants_and_relationship_dynamics | contestants]]' characters or romantic connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This focus on [[producers_role_in_creating_drama_on_the_bachelor | drama]] led to harmful situations, such as a [[the_bachelor_contestant_stereotypes | contestant]] being baselessly accused of being an escort, which ruined her reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

The show's handling of the racial issues, including Chris Harrison's comments and the subsequent harassment of [[cultural_impact_and_fan_community_of_the_bachelor | Bachelor Nation]] figures, highlighted how [[role_of_producers_and_editing_in_the_bachelor | producers]] "pull strings" that place [[contestants_and_relationship_dynamics | contestants]] in "very rough situations for [[producers_role_in_creating_drama_on_the_bachelor | drama]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. This approach was ultimately deemed not to make "good TV" and contributed to the season being "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. The show's "extreme tone shift" from addressing "difficult race issues" to casually announcing the next [[analysis_of_the_bachelorette_and_its_contestants | bachelorette]] was also criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

The overall sentiment was that "messing with people's lives for entertainment has gone too far" and that there are "other ways to make [[critique_of_the_bachelor_as_a_television_show | television]] interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. As a result of these issues, Chris Harrison was eventually replaced as host for subsequent seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

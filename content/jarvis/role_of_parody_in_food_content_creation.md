From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

A growing trend in online food content involves preparing meals directly on kitchen countertops, often resulting in bizarre and seemingly unappetizing dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These videos are primarily created for views and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Countertop Cooking Phenomenon

The phenomenon began gaining traction with videos like "The Ultimate Nacho Hack," where nachos are blended into a ball with an ice cream scooper and eaten in a cone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. A similar video, "The Ultimate Spaghetti Trick," involves cooking spaghetti on a kitchen counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. These [[viral_food_hacks_on_social_media | viral food hacks]] follow a distinct formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>:
*   Food is cooked directly on the countertop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   The person filming or interacting behind the camera provides exaggerated, unmotivated reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, often feigning amazement at basic cooking steps or obvious observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   The "cook" makes outlandish claims, such as the method being "the easiest way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> or that there's "no mess" despite food being spread everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   The actions are presented as supposedly routine or traditional, like claiming "real Italians" make spaghetti on the counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

These videos often include bizarre ingredients or combinations, such as hot dogs mixed with mac and cheese on a counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, or a party dip with black beans, queso, jalapenos, and sour cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The implied audience for these dishes, such as "your kids will love this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, seems highly unlikely. The food is often presented in a way that suggests it will be [[the_ethics_of_wasting_food_for_viral_videos | thrown away after]] filming, indicating the content's primary purpose is not culinary, but shock value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Rick Lax's Influence

A common thread linking many of these "gross out food videos" is the [[influence_of_rick_lax_on_food_videos | Facebook magician Rick Lax]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Rick Lax Productions, his production outlet, is responsible for numerous shows and viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. Pages like Adley and Taylor Watson, which posted the ultimate nacho hack and spaghetti trick, are part of his production network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

## Parody and Public Reaction

Many of these videos are created as "scripted dramas, [[breast_milk_parody_and_its_implications_in_online_media | parody]], and [[humor_and_satire_in_reality_tv_reviews | satire]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. They often carry disclaimers stating they are "purely fictitious" and "for entertainment purposes only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

However, when these videos are shared on [[social_media_platforms_and_content_imitation | social media platforms]] without this context, they frequently go viral and generate widespread outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. A prime example is when the "Ultimate Spaghetti Trick" video was posted on Twitter without context, accumulating over 9 million views, 60,000 likes, and 45,000-50,000 retweets, almost all expressing anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. This outrage even led to "Prego" (a pasta sauce brand) trending nationwide in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>, and garnered reactions from celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

Rick Lax maintains that while he is "not a foodie or an expert," he objects to calling these recipes "gross" or "awful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. He clarifies that "good videos" in his context means "videos that perform well on social media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. One of the performers, Getty, even admitted about her recipes: "It's nothing that people should do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

Ultimately, these videos highlight a peculiar internet phenomenon where content designed as [[creating_parody_animation_channels | parody]] and satire achieves virality through the public's shock and outrage, rather than its intended humorous or fictional context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. While the creators may intend them as entertainment, the practical outcome is often public frustration and concerns over [[the_ethics_of_wasting_food_for_viral_videos | food waste]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

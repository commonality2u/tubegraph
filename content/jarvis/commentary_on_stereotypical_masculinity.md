The YouTube channel Five-Minute Crafts, known for its DIY content, launched a specific offshoot called "Five-Minute Crafts Men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This channel, along with others like "Five-Minute Crafts Kids," "Girly," "Family," and "Teens," targets extremely broad demographics, though the content across these channels is often "exactly the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The channel's content often attempts to portray or cater to [[Gender Stereotypes in Online Content | stereotypical masculinity]], though often with little relevance or practicality.

## Portrayals of Masculinity

The speaker, adopting a satirical persona named "Testosterone Johnson," initially frames his critique by claiming that typical "wimpy little crafts" are not for someone of his "masculinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This sets the stage for a critical examination of how the "Men" channel specifically attempts to address or misrepresent male interests and traits.

### "Handy Hacks for Men"
One video titled "22 handy hacks for men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, despite its title suggesting masculine practicality, features useless power drill hacks, such as attaching a toothbrush to a drill for cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This is critiqued as being wasteful and impractical, highlighting a superficial attempt to associate tools with male content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Exaggerated Male Behavior
Videos on the "Men" channel also feature segments depicting men "home alone" trying "funny hairstyles" and "having fun in front of the mirror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Another segment shows "normal male communication" involving men discussing changing tires or "simple joys" like throwing something into a trash can from two feet away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. These vignettes are presented as lacking context and failing to genuinely portray male enjoyment or communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Superficial Haircut Interpretations
A segment titled "these men's haircuts reveal the true personality of their owners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> attempts to categorize men's personalities based on drawings of famous people with different hairstyles. For example, long hair is associated with a "creative personality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The speaker finds this categorization "weird phrasing" and potentially demeaning to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## [[Misogyny in modern podcasting | Misogynistic Tropes]]

The "Five-Minute Crafts Men" channel frequently includes content that reinforces [[Gender Stereotypes in Online Content | gender stereotypes]] and [[Misogyny in modern podcasting | misogynistic views]].

### "How to understand a woman"
A recurring theme is the presentation of women as inherently incomprehensible to men. A clip features a book titled "How to understand a woman," followed by the statement, "women just don't make no sense and my right fellas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This reinforces a common [[Cultural stereotypes in media | cultural stereotype]] of women as illogical or difficult to understand, and men as sharing this common frustration.

### The "Wife Test" Experiment
Another video segment details a man who dates three women and gives each $5,000 to determine which one he should marry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **First woman:** Spends the money on herself (spa, hairdo, clothes) to be "beautiful for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Second woman:** Spends the money on presents for him, stating "I love you so much this is all for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Third woman:** Invests the money, earning $15,000 and returning the original $5,000, adding the profit to "our family budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

The segment concludes with the question: "Which woman do you think he married? text sexism - 69 69 69 - vote" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, and the answer, "of course the most beautiful one men are always men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The speaker critiques this entire scenario, calling it "bachelor shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> and noting that it implies "women just exist to please us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This narrative exemplifies harmful [[mens_insecurity_and_controlling_behavior_in_relationships | stereotypes about women's value]] being tied to their appearance or utility to men, and a [[the_concept_of_alpha_males_and_their_beliefs | cynical view of male decision-making]].

## Over-the-top "Manly" Solutions

The channel frequently includes "life hacks" that are either completely impractical, unnecessary, or directly harmful, under the guise of providing solutions for men.

*   **Tie-tying tutorials:** Despite being a genuinely useful skill, the channel repeatedly shows the "exact same clips" of how to tie a tie, which are often too fast and difficult to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Peanut butter hair hack:** A video suggests putting peanut butter in one's hair without explaining the purpose, leaving the speaker to discover from personal experience that it's messy and hard to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Impractical kitchen hacks:** "Fantastic kitchen hacks" include suggestions like not washing dirty dishes but eating out of something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, stacking fridge items with chopsticks instead of using Tupperware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, and struggling to get toast out of a toaster without burning oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The speaker notes that these hacks "pretend to be practical" but are absurd solutions to common problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

The extreme nature of these "hacks," juxtaposed with the implied male audience, contributes to the [[criticism_of_societal_and_cultural_stereotypes_in_comics | satirical commentary on societal expectations]] surrounding male competence and problem-solving.

## Intended Audience

Despite the branding and content attempting to target men, the reviews on the "Five-Minute Crafts" Facebook page show that the actual audience includes children, specifically a "little girl" who is "clearly lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. This further underscores the disconnect between the channel's superficial portrayal of masculinity and its actual reach.

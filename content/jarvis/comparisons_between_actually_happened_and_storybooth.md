YouTube channels like Actually Happened and Storybooth present animated stories, but a key distinction lies in the authenticity of their content and their methods of story acquisition.

## Storybooth: User-Submitted Authenticity

Storybooth is described as a website and YouTube channel where children actually submit stories, which they then narrate themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53"></a>. An example of this authenticity is seen with a young girl named Aquila, who narrated her own story, with links back to her channel, creating a positive experience for all involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58"></a>. This approach emphasizes genuine, personal narratives directly from the storytellers.

## Actually Happened: Claims vs. Reality

Actually Happened describes itself as a "digital platform that gives people the chance to have their personal stories turn into animations and share it around the world," with the only criterion being that the story "must be true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37"></a>. This self-description is almost identical to Storybooth's model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46"></a>.

However, despite its claims, Actually Happened's content is considered "totally fake" and "super dishonest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34"></a>.

### Lack of Submission Platform
Unlike Storybooth, Actually Happened has "no platform to speak up" and "no website" for story submissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18"></a>. The only apparent way to submit stories is by emailing "welcome@brightside.me," an email address used across all channels owned by the Sole Publishing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22"></a>.

### Fabrication and Plagiarism of Stories
Actually Happened's stories are characterized as "vague, generic, provably false or stolen from the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32"></a>. They are fictionalized and/or plagiarized stories "made up by a corporation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16"></a>. Specific examples include:
*   **"I broke up with my girlfriend because of potatoes"**: This oddly specific narrative was found to have been posted on the "Today I F***ed Up" subreddit three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00"></a>.
*   **"I became a criminal but was suddenly caught"**: This story is vague, generic, and hides under the guise of anonymity, lacking any verifiable proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15"></a>.
*   **"I rebelled at school bands but it went too far"**: This story describes a school prank involving a swimming pool in a library and a viral social media campaign with 500 students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55"></a>. This specific scenario has no record on the internet and would have likely been widely reported if true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41"></a>. The story was found on Reddit, where many stories are also fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50"></a>.

### Emotional Manipulation
Actually Happened frequently incorporates dramatic elements such as "divorce and mental breakdowns and depression and disease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03"></a>. The channel uses "people in very vulnerable situations as clickbait," which is seen as "emotionally manipulative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11"></a>. An example is the video "My mom woke up from a coma and it's terrifying," which is believed to be a fake story, despite its emotionally charged nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00"></a>. This manipulation leads viewers to expend emotional energy and offer condolences for fictional narratives, simply to boost comment metrics for the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45"></a>.

### Connection to Sole Publishing
Actually Happened is identified as "another channel started by the 5 minute craftspeople or the bright side people," known as Sole Publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53"></a>. This company is known for abusing the YouTube algorithm by favoring quantity over quality and outright plagiarizing other creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01"></a>.

An email obtained from Sole Publishing for a "scriptwriter" job reveals their intent:
*   **Purpose**: To help their channel (later identified as Actually Happened) reach 1 million subscribers faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13"></a>.
*   **Requirements for scripts**:
    *   **Believability**: Stories "ought to sound like they're told by a real teenager and be as close to real life as possible without creating a sense that they're fake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56"></a>.
    *   **Topicality**: Find subjects that are "understandable, relatable and interesting to as larger number of teenagers as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13"></a>.
    *   **References**: Use "stories of real people that they shared on various social media platforms" as references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21"></a>.
    *   **Structure**: Scripts should be "a real story with the beginning, the development events and an outcome to ensure the viewer doesn't become bored" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28"></a>.
    *   **Language**: "Lively colloquial English" with "excellent quality of English" so the "American viewer should feel that your central characters are native English speakers," despite the company potentially being based in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37"></a>.

The email directly links the scriptwriter job to finished Actually Happened videos, confirming Sole Publishing's ownership and involvement in creating these fictional stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55"></a>.

## Conclusion
The fundamental difference between Actually Happened and Storybooth lies in [[authenticity_of_animated_story_channels | authenticity]]. While Storybooth features genuine, user-narrated stories, Actually Happened actively fabricates or plagiarizes narratives, hiring scriptwriters to create "believable" yet fictional content for commercial gain, often through [[dramatization_and_editing_in_reality_tv | emotional manipulation]]. This practice leads to a [[critique_of_fake_animated_stories | critique of fake animated stories]] and raises questions about [[user_submitted_stories_and_their_authenticity | user submitted stories and their authenticity]].

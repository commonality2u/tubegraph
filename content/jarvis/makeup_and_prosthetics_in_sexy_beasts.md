*Sexy Beasts*, a Netflix dating show, utilizes elaborate makeup and prosthetics as its central conceit. The series features singles wearing "beast" faces, aiming to test if genuine blind date chemistry can form without superficial judgments based on physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Concealing Identity
The core function of the makeup and prosthetics is to conceal the contestants' true faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. While the face is hidden, contestants' eyes can still be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. After a selection is made, the "beast" masks are removed to reveal the contestants' actual appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. Notably, all participants on the show are described as "normal regular everyday models" who are "very attractive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## The 'Beast' Definition
The show's definition of what constitutes a "beast" is "very loose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This results in a wide range of creature designs, from "cute pandas" to "boiling trolls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The show features a variety of characters, including:
*   A witch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>
*   A statue man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>
*   A dolphin girl named Nina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>
*   A scarecrow man with "stitched cheeks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>
*   A mantis man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>
*   A rhino man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>
*   A "cute wolf guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>

The quality and nature of these costumes lead to varying degrees of comfort for viewers. Some masks are described as "too uncanny" or "too real" when they appear too close to humanoid forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. Examples of discomfort-inducing designs include:
*   The scarecrow man with a mouth that appears "sewn together" and an unsettling chin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   A girl with "exposed bone and blood," whose costume makes her "way harder to look at" than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   A character described as an "unfortunately faced lady with a permanent frown" due to her "boily face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

## Impact on Dating and Perception
The intention behind the masks is to remove physical attractiveness from the initial dating equation, prompting the question of whether one "could fall in love with someone based on personality alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. However, the varied and sometimes unsettling nature of the costumes can still influence perception. For example, the "unfortunately faced lady" is eliminated first, with her appearance potentially contributing to this outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. This raises questions about whether the show truly differs from [[sexy_beasts_format_and_concept | superficial dating]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.

## Production Quality
Despite some of the unsettling designs, the makeup work itself is acknowledged as "really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>. The team behind the original British version of *Sexy Beasts* on BBC Three also returned to work on the Netflix adaptation, performing "a great job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

[[YouTube videos that exploit and emotionally manipulate the children who watch videos on our platform]] are described as "vapid and exploitative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. These tactics create a negative experience for advertisers, whose messages may fall on deaf ears, and for viewers in their formative years, who are likely to internalize false information and harmful ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Such methods are often used by large corporations to extract advertiser dollars from the viewing habits of children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

## Characteristics of Exploitative Content

### Common Channel Traits
Exploitative YouTube channels often share several characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:
*   **High Volume Production**: Channels like Bright Side and [[Content Farming and Mass Production on YouTube | 5-Minute Crafts]] post 10 to 15-minute videos three times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Rapid Growth**: Bright Side, for example, gained 16 million subscribers in about a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Clickbait Thumbnails and Titles**:
    *   Channels like [[Content Farming and Mass Production on YouTube | 5-Minute Crafts]] use ridiculous Photoshopped images that do not appear in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   Bright Side uses outright lies or [[Criticism of sensationalist content on YouTube | fear-mongering sensationalist tactics]], suggesting "somebody's out to get you" or advising viewers to "call the police immediately" for mundane situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    *   Titles are often machine-generated and nonsensical, such as "11 witty texts from the geniuses of flirting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> or "8 things that only children born in the year 1990 will find humorous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Content Padding and Lack of Substance
*   **Extended Video Lengths**: Videos often contain only two minutes of content within a ten-minute video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Slow Pacing and Pauses**: Narrators speak very slowly with many pauses, extending the watch time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Riddles with Blank Space**: Riddle videos may include 20-second pauses between riddles, resulting in several minutes of blank space to pad watch time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Devoid of Substance**: Many videos are "devoid of substance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, such as a video listing "10 things you should never Google" which simply advises against Googling things that might scare you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Unsatisfying Answers**: Riddle answers often introduce new, unstated information or admit that the answers are "too diverse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### Content Appropriation
*   [[Fair use and copyright issues on YouTube | Bright Side]] frequently appears to [[ethical_concerns_about_content_appropriation_on_youtube | steal content]] from other creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Parallel Thumbnails and Concepts**: Videos by Bright Side and other channels (e.g., The Infographic Show) sometimes share exactly the same thumbnails and similar content, suggesting direct copying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. A reverse image search revealed Bright Side photoshopped stolen thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

### Disturbing Content
Despite claiming to "always look on the bright side of life and stay positive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, Bright Side frequently features dark topics:
*   **Death and Survival**: "Five riddles you must solve to stay alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Violence and Suicide**: Riddles discuss a man shooting himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, a man committing suicide by jumping off a train after regaining sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, and a man wanting to shoot another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Stalker-like Scenarios**: Text message examples include "Can I follow your home today?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Targeting Children
*   Comments on a Bright Side video titled "This math trick will guess your age" show that a significant portion of their audience consists of 10-year-olds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
*   There is a "moral imperative to be responsible with content that children will see" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, especially given the potential for children to internalize false information and harmful ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The focus is on constructive criticism to examine the systems being taken advantage of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

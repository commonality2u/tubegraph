From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The concept of "alpha male pickup artists" is presented as a prevalent online phenomenon, with new "alpha males" constantly appearing to share their worldview with impressionable followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This perspective suggests that women may not like alpha males because they cannot be controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Critiques of Alpha Male Ideology

Critics suggest that the entire "alpha male" concept is a scam designed to exploit vulnerable followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The advice given by these figures is seen as potentially [[the_harmful_effects_of_trying_to_be_an_alpha_male | harmful]], possibly scaring women away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. A fundamental counter-argument is that women are not all the same and cannot be "trained like dogs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The narrator notes that much of the content discussing women is [[misogyny_in_modern_podcasting | misleading]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Zay Double Edge: An Exemplar of Alpha Male Teachings

One prominent online figure, Zay Double Edge (also known as ZayDbe), exemplifies this ideology. He authored a book titled *Stop Getting Left on Red, Get Nudes Instead: Rules, Tips and Strategies to Become an Elite Texter* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Core Beliefs and Advice

Zay Double Edge's teachings include several key principles:

*   **Initial Relationship Detachment**
    *   In the beginning stages of a relationship, a man should not take any woman seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   A "real woman" should "almost beat you up" before you take her seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   Relationships should be viewed as a "game" that is fun; otherwise, a man might start hating women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

*   **Perceived [[misconceptions_about_women_and_manipulative_behaviors | Female Manipulation]]**
    *   Zay describes a "woman's top manipulation strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, where women post indirect pictures on social media (e.g., empty wine glasses) to show they are moving on or with another guy, aiming to make a man feel he lost something good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   This is seen as a "test" to gauge how weak a man is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. A "strong dude" should not react, and if he remains silent, she will return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. If she is truly done, she won't try to manipulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

*   **[[Gender Stereotypes in Online Content | Masculinity]] and Control**
    *   The average American guy is depicted as a "simp" who is "programmed" to be so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   "Real men" do not let women dictate what a real man is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, and they should "die on principles," regardless of whether they are right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Historical figures like MLK, Malcolm X, and Osama Bin Laden are cited as examples of men who "died on principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   Men should not express their feelings when pressured by a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, as this is seen as buckling and being a "beta male simp mangina" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
    *   When a woman is born, she is seen as already a "princess" on the "highest of the pedestal," while a man must make himself a prince or king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
    *   Men should "thrive in discomfort" and "live on the edge" to feel like a man and find happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. The "microwave age" is blamed for men being scared and unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

*   **Views on Women's Nature**
    *   Women are described as "emotional beings" who feel deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   Heartbreak for a woman hurts as much as grieving over a death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   Women "break like glass" and "never really fully recover" after heartbreaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   A woman's past "matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Men who say it doesn't are "beta males" with a "captain save her mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
    *   Women are "programmable" by the men in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    *   Women have a "unique ability to be in tune with the emotional and spiritual world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
    *   A woman's attraction level is measured by "how compliant she is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. If she complies, her "feminine nature will make her like you" because "she doesn't have free will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

*   **Signs of Being "Thirsty"**
    *   Complaining about one's love life, especially about women choosing "bad boys" over "good guys" like oneself, signals "thirst" and is a "cry for help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This is interpreted as wanting "pity sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
    *   Failing to succeed with women even after "learning game" (pickup strategies) indicates thirst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
    *   Not knowing what questions to ask a woman implies a man is so thirsty for sex that he doesn't care who she truly is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

*   **[[Advice on masculinity and selfperception | Core Masculinity Principles]]**
    *   Never ask a man for a favor with an empty hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Asking for more free advice is "beta male" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
    *   Never tolerate disrespect from anyone, even preferring death over disrespect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. A "female can't teach you" this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
    *   Always be alert and aware of your surroundings, never walking with your head down, as this makes one vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the narrator decides against adopting the "alpha male" lifestyle, citing its difficulty, the perceived dislike from women, the need to deny emotions, the constant worry about being robbed, and the implied necessity of "dying on principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The alternative offered is to be oneself and not [[challenging_relationship_dynamics | manipulate]] others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

The MTV show [[discussion_of_the_mtv_show_yo_momma | *Yo Momma*]], which premiered in 2006, is explored as a "blast from the past" by hosts. The show's premise revolved around "yo mama" joke battles, primarily hosted by [[role_and_presentation_of_wilmer_valderrama_on_yo_momma | Wilmer Valderrama]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Initial memories of the show include [[role_and_presentation_of_wilmer_valderrama_on_yo_momma | Wilmer Valderrama]]'s presence and a "Room Raiders" type segment used to gather material for the joke competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## [[role_and_presentation_of_wilmer_valderrama_on_yo_momma | Wilmer Valderrama]] as Host
[[role_and_presentation_of_wilmer_valderrama_on_yo_momma | Wilmer Valderrama]]'s role as host is noted as "interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. The show appeared to be an attempt by [[role_and_presentation_of_wilmer_valderrama_on_yo_momma | Wilmer Valderrama]] to redefine his image after the success of *That '70s Show*, projecting a "cool guy" vibe with leather jackets and jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. He was presented as an "American heartthrob," with women fanning themselves upon his appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. However, his past dating history, particularly with Demi Lovato and Lindsay Lohan when they were 17, is highlighted as a problematic aspect that should have been rebranded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

## The Show's Format and Authenticity
The show attempts to portray itself as an impromptu "back alley dance thing" with "illest trash talkers" found on the streets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. In reality, it was a full Viacom MTV production with casting calls and filming permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. A notable [[critique_on_the_format_and_execution_of_yo_momma | critique of the format]] is that [[role_and_presentation_of_wilmer_valderrama_on_yo_momma | Wilmer Valderrama]] never delivered the rules of the competition, always outsourcing this task to another person named Sam, who had no other role on the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. The show's rules were largely non-existent until the very end, making it a "free-for-all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## [[analysis_of_humor_and_jokes_used_in_yo_momma | Analysis of Humor and Jokes]]
The show's humor primarily relies on "yo mama" jokes. Contestants are judged on originality, delivery, quickness, and "sting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

### Common Themes
A recurring prediction is that almost all jokes will focus on a mother being "so fat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. Other common themes include a mother's age or stupidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.

### Absurdist Humor
Some jokes are noted for their absurdism and departure from typical "yo mama" tropes, such as "Yo mama's breath stink so bad she put a Tic Tac in her mouth, it crawled out and filed a restraining order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>. Another example is "your mom is so fat that she was born on January 1st and 2nd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:00">[22:59:00]</a>, which, despite a potentially deeper meaning of transcending time and space, was not delivered as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>. The phrase "boiled quarters" also becomes a strangely memorable, if nonsensical, joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35:00">[29:35:00]</a>.

### Problematic Elements
Several jokes are identified as problematic due to their offensive content:
*   **Racial and Cultural Insensitivity**:
    *   A joke stating "your hair is so fake it says made in China on the back" is considered a "hate crime" and something that would be cancelled in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.
    *   A contestant's repeated focus on jokes about "black hair" is questioned for its poor taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.
    *   The joke "you're so black you make Wesley Snipes look..." is immediately shut down as not permissible for the speaker to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. This highlights a [[cultural_sensitivity_in_tiktok_videos | cultural sensitivity]] issue.
*   **[[discussion_on_toxic_dynamics_and_bullying_in_reality_tv | Toxic Dynamics and Bullying]]**:
    *   The show features a contestant, Jordan, who is seen as an "industry plant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>, potentially a writer for the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>, and represents "rich kids who think they are tough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. His character is consistently disliked for his persona and perceived appropriation of AAVE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.
    *   Jordan reappropriating another contestant's "gorilla" joke and receiving a better reception is seen as unfair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.
*   **Homophobia**:
    *   The show features a "ghetto Spider-Man" with a Louis Vuitton "members only" jacket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>. The reaction to this character by [[role_and_presentation_of_wilmer_valderrama_on_yo_momma | Wilmer Valderrama]] and a subsequent "say it loud, I'm black and proud" moment is labeled as problematic and "f***ed up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>. This points to a larger [[discussion_on_the_consequences_of_homophobic_content_and_representation_in_media | discussion on the consequences of homophobic content and representation in media]]. The host explicitly asks to "Please do not touch my black f***ing dude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>.

## Overall [[critique_on_the_format_and_execution_of_yo_momma | Critique]] and Legacy
The show is perceived as trying to be "hip and cool and urban" by incorporating elements like b-boy stances and a consistent "fish out of water white dude" character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. Watching the show back reveals it was clearly "meant to only be enjoyed in 2006," indicating that its humor and cultural relevance did not age well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. The show is recognized as being number one in terms of "fat-phobic shows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. Ultimately, the show's "crusty" nature and reliance on outdated humor are noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>.

Fictional influencers represent a unique and evolving phenomenon in the digital landscape, distinct from traditional influencers who merely curate an idealized version of their real lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. These are characters literally written by a team of writers, who pretend to be influencers but do not exist in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This emerging genre, particularly prevalent on platforms like TikTok, raises questions about transparency and the [[impact of fabricated stories on audience perceptions | impact of fabricated stories on audience perceptions]].

## The Architects: Forefront Production Company

A significant portion of the [[fictional_influencers_on_tiktok | fictional influencers on TikTok]] are managed by a production company called Forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. This company, founded by a USC screenwriter, currently manages 22 fictional stories and aims to build a "Marvel Cinematic Universe" of fake people and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. They employ a "TV pilot approach," where some stories succeed and others fail, with the goal of creating a larger interconnected narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

## Case Study: The Saga of Sydney

One prominent fictional influencer is a character named Sydney, who claims to work for a dating app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. Sydney's TikToks include dating advice and self-help content, intertwined with an "insane storyline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. Her character arc includes living in her sister's shadow, working a minimum wage job, and residing on her sister's couch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.

A major plot point involves Sydney discovering her sister's fiancé is cheating on her through her "work" at the dating app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. This discovery leads to a dramatic confrontation, filmed and posted to TikTok, where the sister chooses the cheating fiancé and kicks Sydney out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. In a bizarre twist, Sydney then finds a new roommate: the mistress of her sister's fiancé <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.

### Interconnected Narratives: The "MCU" of Fake Influencers

The fictional narratives often cross over, creating an intricate "MCU crossover arc" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. After being suspended from her fictional dating app job, Sydney faces financial hardship, leading her to compete for the billion-dollar estate of another fictional character, Butler Darren's boss, Mr. Bucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>. Butler Darren is presented as a fictional billionaire's assistant whose storyline involves finding a girlfriend for his boss and having an affair with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This competition includes other characters from the Forefront universe, such as Much Joy (a fictional billionaire's daughter, or rather, her identical twin) and Trixie (Much Joy's evil twin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>.

## The [[impact_of_fabricated_stories_on_audience_perceptions | Impact on Audiences]]: Transparency and Deception

The most significant [[impact of fabricated stories on audience perceptions | impact of fabricated stories on audience perceptions]] stems from the lack of clear disclosure about the fictional nature of these influencers. It is "not clear if everyone is on the same page about whether or not this stuff is real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

For instance, when Sydney posted a TikTok about dating app red flags, many viewers likely believed it was real dating advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. This content was subsequently picked up by internet news sites and even the *New York Post*, none of which clarified that the influencer or the story was fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. This demonstrates how easily fabricated narratives can disseminate as real news, influencing perceptions, even if the content itself is "completely harmless in this scenario" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

### Hidden Disclosures and Audience Engagement

While some [[fictional_influencers_on_tiktok | fictional influencers on TikTok]] do include "fictional" in their bios, it's often placed subtly, like "50 spicy 50 sweet 100 fictional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. Hashtags like `#fictional` are sometimes used, but frequently appear "sandwiched in between these other hashtags" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>, making them easy to miss. The content creators have "benefited from not doing that for a very long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

The nature of TikTok's "For You Page" algorithm means users often encounter these videos without actively seeking them out, thus not realizing their fictional status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Viewers can be fooled, or they might "play into the world" in the comment sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This dynamic suggests that while some viewers remain "intrigued after realizing it's fake," many are initially "hooking people in who think it's real at first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>.

Despite the often "worst acting" and "worst writing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, which seems intentional, the stories are designed to draw viewers in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## Ethical Concerns

The approach of these fictional influencers, particularly when they appear in contexts like dating advice, raises ethical questions. It "feels dishonest and like this weird ethical gray area" when content presented as real information is, in fact, entirely fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. Unlike Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) which are explicitly presented as games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, these fictional influencer accounts operate more as a "lifestyle," blurring the lines between reality and fiction for unsuspecting audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

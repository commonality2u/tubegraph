From: [[jarvis]] <br/> 

The quality of animation in various [[overview_of_animated_story_channels | animated story channels]] often reflects their operational models, particularly the prevalence of "content farms" prioritizing quantity over artistic merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This analysis focuses on the perceived production values of prominent channels like [[critique_on_my_story_animated | My Story Animated]] and [[analysis_of_fake_animated_story_channels | Actually Happened]], contrasting them with an implied standard set by more legitimate channels.

## Production Quality Overview

Many [[clickbait_animation_channels | clickbait animation channels]], including [[critique_on_my_story_animated | My Story Animated]], are characterized by "lazy production quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This low quality is generally attributed to the channels themselves, as a "money grab" by "content farm[s]," rather than the individual animators who produce the stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. Such channels aim to "pump out a ton of like low quality content" to attract viewers and advertising revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

## Comparison Between Channels

### My Story Animated vs. Actually Happened
[[critique_on_my_story_animated | My Story Animated]] is described as a "copy of a copy," being a direct imitation of [[analysis_of_fake_animated_story_channels | Actually Happened]], which itself copied the premise of `Storybooth` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A key distinction highlighted is that [[critique_on_my_story_animated | My Story Animated]] has "somehow figured out how to invest even less in production quality" than [[analysis_of_fake_animated_story_channels | Actually Happened]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Specific Animation Observations
*   **Inconsistency and Art Style**: An example noted is a coffin appearing in a "different art style" within an animation, suggesting it was not part of the channel's "animation tool kids" and possibly "googled" and inserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Lack of Frame-by-Frame Drawing**: It is observed that the animation is not drawn "frame-by-frame," implying the use of a "library or a toolkit of some kind" for asset assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Mismatch with Narrative**: In one instance, the animation for a mailman character "is not great but it also doesn't match the story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Character Design Consistency**: A critique is made regarding the minimal difference between a character's child and adult self, where "the only difference between her child self and her adult self is the length of her legs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Additionally, two characters described as "plain girl" and "cute guy" look "exactly the same" in the animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Animation Errors**: Specific animation issues include a character's arm being stuck in an unnatural position throughout a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

## Outsourcing and Its Impact
The videos are frequently outsourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. The creator of the review commissioned an animated story from Fiverr for approximately $100 and 20 minutes of effort, demonstrating the low cost and quick turnaround that likely contribute to the "crazy margins" of these content farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. The Fiver-commissioned animation received a positive assessment for its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.

## Conclusion
The analysis suggests a consistent pattern of low-effort, templated animation across many [[overview_of_animated_story_channels | animated story channels]], particularly those identified as content farms. This approach sacrifices detail and consistency for rapid production and cost efficiency, fitting their model of distributing probably [[critique_of_fake_animated_stories | fake stories]] to attract viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The creator also demonstrates the potential to create a [[creating_parody_animation_channels | parody animation channel]] with similar methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

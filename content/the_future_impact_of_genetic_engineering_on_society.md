The early 21st century is witnessing a genomics revolution, with profound implications for the future of human society. Developments in genetic understanding, embryo selection, and gene editing technologies are poised to reshape human health, longevity, and potentially even cognitive abilities, while also raising significant societal and ethical questions. This article outlines the potential future impacts as discussed by Steve Hsu.

## Current Landscape: Embryo Selection

The groundwork for future genetic engineering is already being laid with current practices in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and [[embryo_selection_and_genetic_prediction | embryo selection]].
Millions of families globally undergo IVF, often producing multiple embryos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. This presents the "embryo choice problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>. Companies like Genomic Prediction are already working with IVF clinics to genotype embryos and provide risk assessments for various conditions. For example, an embryo might be identified as an outlier for breast cancer or cardiovascular disease risk, allowing parents to select other embryos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. This technology is already demonstrating tangible benefits, such as a potential increase of four disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by selecting from 10 embryos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:23:00">[36:23:00]</a>.

The adoption of IVF is already significant, with one in ten babies in Denmark born through IVF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>, and 3-5% in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:46">[01:29:46]</a>. This existing infrastructure provides a pathway for more advanced genetic interventions.

## The Advent of Gene Editing

Beyond selection, direct gene editing using technologies like CRISPR is anticipated to become viable for complex human traits. Hsu predicts that within approximately 10 years, CRISPR technologies will be ready for "massively multiplexed edits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:08:00">[41:08:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>. This would allow for navigating the "high-dimensional space" of genetic traits as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>. The pace of this development is expected to coincide with a better understanding of the causal genetic variants for various traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:22">[01:40:22]</a>.

## Potential Transformations

The combination of improved genetic understanding and editing capabilities could lead to significant transformations in human life.

### Extended Longevity
Genetic engineering holds the potential to dramatically extend human lifespan. Current polygenic predictors for overall health suggest that a "one in a billion" type person might naturally live to around 120 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:17:00">[42:17:00]</a>. However, with genetic engineering to reduce risks for major diseases, it's speculated that humans could potentially be engineered to live much longer, perhaps even 300 years naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:50:00">[54:50:00]</a>. This is compared to successes in animal breeding, such as chickens bio-engineered to lay almost an egg a day, versus an egg a month in the wild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:10:00">[43:10:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:22:00">[43:22:00]</a>.

### Cognitive Enhancement
One of the most controversial and "frustrating" areas, due to societal sensitivities, is the potential for [[human_enhancement_and_intelligence_augmentation | cognitive enhancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00"></a>. The collection of genomic data linked to cognitive measurements is lagging due to these fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. Hsu predicts that with around one to two million well-phenotyped genomes, a reasonably accurate IQ predictor (with a standard error of perhaps 10 points) could be developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. While concerns about pleiotropy (genes affecting multiple traits) exist, the high-dimensional nature of genetic influence means engineers could potentially "drive around" undesirable trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

### Advanced Reproductive Technologies
The ability to generate a large number of embryos for selection or editing could be significantly enhanced by new technologies.
*   **Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) for Gamete Production:** Technology to revert adult cells (e.g., skin cells) into iPSCs, and then into egg cells, has been largely mastered in rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>. Startups are currently working on human applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:34">[01:38:34]</a>. This could theoretically allow for the creation and selection from tens of thousands of embryos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:36">[01:39:36]</a>.
*   **Iterated Embryo Selection:** This involves selecting preferred embryos and then using them to generate a new batch of embryos for further selection, before implantation. This is considered plausible, though less actively researched currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:55">[01:40:55]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>.
It's also noteworthy that young egg donors can already produce a surprisingly high number of eggs per cycle, sometimes 60 to 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:41">[01:35:41]</a>, providing a large pool for selection even with current methods.

### Novel Applications
Beyond health and core traits, genetic information could enable other applications:
*   **Predicting Facial Appearance:** By mapping the genetic basis of facial parameters used in recognition algorithms, it may become possible to reconstruct a person's future appearance from their embryonic DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:51:00">[50:51:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:23:00">[51:23:00]</a>.
*   **Genetic Verification in Dating:** DNA could be used to verify self-reported traits on dating apps, such as height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:16:00">[56:16:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:00:00">[57:00:00]</a>.
*   **Genomic Matchmaking:** Parents might be advised on mating based on how their genomes complement each other for desired traits in offspring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[57:05:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:47:00">[57:47:00]</a>.

## Societal and Ethical Considerations

The advancement of genetic engineering brings forth complex societal and ethical debates.

### Inequality and Access
A major concern is the potential for increased societal inequality, leading to a "Morlocks and Eloi" scenario where only the wealthy can afford these enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:57:00">[54:57:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:20:00">[55:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. This could result in a bimodal distribution of traits in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:30">[01:43:30]</a>.
Possible responses include integrating these technologies into national healthcare systems, as seen with IVF in Denmark and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>, or implementing policies to redistribute access, perhaps allowing more aggressive edits or more embryos for below-average families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:18">[01:45:18]</a>.

### Regulation and Global Dynamics
Regulating these technologies will be challenging, especially as they become increasingly based on data ("bits") that can be easily transferred globally, similar to how [[ai_scalability_and_breakthroughs | AI scalability and breakthroughs]] are impacting industries. As clinics adopt on-site sequencing, reliance on centralized labs will decrease, making it harder to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:04:00">[49:04:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01:00">[50:01:00]</a>. Countries may choose divergent paths, some banning the technologies and others providing universal free access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>.

### Shifting Public and Political Perceptions
Public and political attitudes towards genetic engineering are complex and can shift. Hsu notes an irony: while many contemporary "wokeists" oppose these technologies, early 20th-century progressives, including figures like Margaret Sanger, were proponents of what would now be termed eugenics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>. In contrast, in China, the term for eugenics ("healthy production") is viewed positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. This highlights the culturally and historically contingent nature of these debates. Hsu argues that the goal of having healthy, long-lived people should be broadly desirable and that these technologies could help address existing inequalities if applied thoughtfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:45">[01:42:45]</a>.

## The Pace of Progress
The scientific and technological advancements in genomics are occurring rapidly. While the full societal impact will unfold over decades, the foundational technologies for [[advancements_in_genomics_and_ai | embryo selection]] are already in use, and advanced gene editing is on the near horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:08:00">[41:08:00]</a>. The future AI, when looking back at the 21st century's genomics revolution, will find the papers proving these possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>. The coming years are expected to bring these "fun times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a> with both immense potential and significant challenges for society.

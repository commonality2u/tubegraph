Antarctica, often envisioned as a frozen wasteland, holds tantalizing clues to a vastly different past, potentially even a lush and green environment during the existence of the human species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This possibility is supported by findings like ancient fossils, confirming that 90 million years ago, a dense rainforest thrived where miles of ice now dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>. The central question, however, is whether this verdant period coincided with human habitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.

## Enigmatic Ancient Maps

Adding to the mystery are ancient maps that depict Antarctica free of ice, a continent our civilization supposedly only discovered in 1820 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. For example, the Oronteus Finaeus map from 1531 illustrates Antarctica and includes mountains on its edges, consistent with geological observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. The map's legend claims it reveals regions previously "hidden in darkness," suggesting it was based on much older, decaying source maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>. This contradicts the notion that these early mapmakers merely added a fantasy continent to balance the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>. The precision of longitudes on these ancient maps further hints at a civilization capable of exploring and mapping the Earth during the last ice age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.

## Theories of Earth Crust Displacement

The concept of a once-temperate Antarctica was significantly explored by Charles Hapgood, whose book *Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings* investigates these anomalous maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>. Hapgood proposed the "Earth crust displacement" theory, suggesting that the entire outer crust of the Earth could occasionally shift, moving continents like Antarctica into different latitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. While mainstream academia often critiques this theory by citing Antarctica's frozen state for millions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>, the idea of a comet impact initiating such a shift has been considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>.

While still not entirely dismissed, the focus has shifted towards the [[the_younger_dryas_impact_hypothesis_and_its_effect_on_civilization|Younger Dryas impact hypothesis]] as a more scientifically robust explanation for ancient cataclysms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. However, the mystery of Antarctica's past remains a key area of [[speculations_about_ancient_civilizations_and_their_advanced_knowledge|speculations about ancient civilizations and their advanced knowledge]].

## Contemporary Observations and Agreements

A friend who traveled to Antarctica observed that the mountains appeared "eerily pointy and foursided" and that there were "way more Mountain than he thought it would be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>. More intriguingly, there's a widely acknowledged international pact among countries with claims to Antarctica, agreeing not to dig for or remove any minerals. This has led to [[secret_knowledge_and_conspiracies|speculations about secret knowledge and conspiracies]] that they are "clearly protecting or preserving something that may or may not be under" three miles of ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

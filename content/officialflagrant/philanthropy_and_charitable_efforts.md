MrBeast (Jimmy) believes that money is a means to grow a company and help people, finding it "a little bit more fun" to operate this way than to focus solely on profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>. His core philosophy revolves around constantly reinvesting and giving away money to improve his content and assist others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Origins of Giving
Jimmy started giving away money at age 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. His approach began when he was 18, and after making a few thousand dollars in a month, he wondered what would happen if he just gave it all away and tried to make a bit more the next month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This strategy has continued every month since, scaling from thousands to millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. He gives his money away to the point of considering himself "poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Charitable Initiatives
Jimmy's charitable efforts include:
*   **Initial Support for Crew**: Initially, he focused on "hooking up the boys" (his crew) with money from challenges when they had little to no savings, before expanding to help others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Food Pantry**: He runs a food pantry, learning new things about its operation every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:55">[02:00:55]</a>. This initiative is part of his long-term goal to establish charities and businesses run by homeless individuals when he becomes a billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:14">[02:01:14]</a>. He emphasizes the impact on individuals who, despite working, may struggle to afford basic necessities like food, and how free food can free up funds for rent or bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:51">[03:06:51]</a>.
*   **Medical Assistance**: He plans to fund a video to help a thousand people regain their eyesight, driven by the realization that many only lack vision due to financial constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:57">[01:35:57]</a>.
*   **Spontaneous Acts of Kindness**: Jimmy frequently helps people off-camera, such as giving money to homeless individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:40">[03:07:40]</a>.

## Personal Fulfillment from Giving
MrBeast describes the emotional impact of his charitable acts:
*   **Pizza Delivery Guy**: Tipping a pizza delivery guy $10,000 resulted in a profound emotional reaction where the man cried and expressed gratitude for being able to spend a day with his children, something his demanding work schedule prevented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:58">[03:04:58]</a>. Jimmy states that this experience "feels better than any car," shirt, or expensive pants, and even "still better than when I give people a million dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:37">[03:05:37]</a>.
*   **Chasing Happiness**: He admits to "chasing" the feeling of making people happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:46">[03:05:46]</a>. He likes it when people smile and are happy, stating it "just makes me feel good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:28">[03:07:28]</a>.
*   **Critiques and Perspective**: While some online [[Social commentary on public figures and culture | critics]] accuse him of only being philanthropic for the camera, he dismisses these comments, stating that if you're not getting hate, "you're just irrelevant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:04">[03:09:04]</a>. He is "numb" to such negativity, focusing on his own fulfillment from his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>.

## Business and Philanthropy
MrBeast aims to integrate charitable efforts into his [[Future plans and business ventures | business ventures]]. He initially hoped his Beast Burger line would be plant-based due to its goodwill potential, and it remains his "long-term goal" to transition it to fully plant-based options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:22">[01:51:22]</a>. He believes that consumers will support his brands because they know he reinvests the money to help others rather than buying luxury items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:57">[02:18:57]</a>. He argues that if consumers have a choice between a "horseshit" Hershey's chocolate bar (whose profits go to "some rich guy") and a "great" Feastables chocolate bar (whose profits go to his employees and are ultimately given away), they should choose Feastables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:12">[02:19:12]</a>.

## Political Aspirations
MrBeast has expressed [[The influence of billionaires in politics | political aspirations]], considering a run for president around age 40 or 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>. His proposed campaign strategy would involve giving away all his money to become a billionaire with "literally 0 in my bank account," positioning himself as unbuyable and dedicated to "what's best for people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>. He envisions ignoring lobbyists and living off the presidential salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. This approach mirrors his current philosophy of distributing wealth rather than hoarding it.

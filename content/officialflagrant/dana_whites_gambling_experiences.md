Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) promoter Dana White is a known enthusiast of high-stakes gambling, particularly Baccarat, and maintains a competitive "war" against casinos like Caesars Palace. His approach to gambling reflects his business philosophy: taking on major challenges and seeking to defy expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:01">[01:38:01]</a>.

## Gambling Philosophy

White sees gambling as being "right up there with everything that I love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:35">[01:45:35]</a>. He views it as a war, especially against large casino corporations, where each night is a battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:13">[01:49:13]</a>. He loves the challenge of going "toe-to-toe with the biggest casino company in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>.

His loyalty extends to the casinos he plays at, noting that he is "very fortunate" and "take[s] care of people" including dealers, ensuring they are on his "team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:12">[02:07:12]</a>.

## Preferred Game: Baccarat

White's game of choice is Baccarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:37">[01:47:37]</a>. He describes the Baccarat room at Caesars Palace as "packed wall to wall with Chinese people" who are "absolute degenerate Baccarat players" with "good gambling vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:40">[01:47:40]</a>. He learned the game by watching them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:35">[02:05:35]</a>.

Baccarat is statistically the closest game to a 50/50 chance, with better odds than Blackjack, yet casinos allow higher bets (up to $300,000 per hand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:10">[01:55:10]</a>. This allows him to reach his nightly winning target quickly, sometimes in just three hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:45">[01:55:45]</a>. Casinos dislike this style of play as it means quick wins and departures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:23">[02:01:23]</a>.

## High Stakes and Strategies

White sets a daily win limit of $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:26">[01:53:26]</a>. If he hits this, he leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:31">[01:53:31]</a>. When he loses, he's willing to go "guns a-blazing" and use his entire credit line, which is $6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>. He has lost $6 million in a single night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, but maintains that he can shake it off and return to work the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:31">[01:54:31]</a>.

He tracks his wins and losses by year. Since January 1st, he claims to have won $16.5 million from Caesars Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:58">[01:49:58]</a>, having only lost twice during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:15">[01:51:15]</a>. Even with a $6 million loss, he would still be up $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:01">[01:55:01]</a>.

> White keeps his "day" at a $1 million limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:26">[01:53:26]</a>. He has been "clipping them from anywhere from $800 [thousand] to a million a night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:41">[01:53:41]</a>. When he loses, he goes through his whole $6 million credit line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>.

## Casino Relationships and Superstitions

White frequently plays at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, where he has a special room built for him within the high-limit area, equipped with a TV, a gaming chair, and a dining table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:12">[01:46:12]</a>. He praises Caesars for treating big players well and not "sweating the money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>. He also uses his points for Christmas gifts for his employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>. He enjoys the challenge of playing against the Corano family, who own Caesars, and appreciates their "classy" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:19">[01:50:19]</a>.

He is very superstitious, especially about the "vibe" of the casino and the dealer's attitude. He dislikes "shitty" dealers with bad attitudes who "want you to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:56">[02:06:56]</a>. He prefers to play in places where "everybody's on my team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:33">[02:07:33]</a>. He has also observed that Chinese gamblers are very superstitious about things like animals on shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:46">[02:05:46]</a>.

He recounts a negative experience at a casino in Niagara Falls, where he was promised a $1 million credit line but was denied further credit after losing $300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:39">[01:58:39]</a>. He advises that if one wants to gamble, it's best to fly to Vegas because of the competition and better treatment for players, including discounts on losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:18">[01:59:18]</a>. Casinos in Vegas will drop a player's limits if they consistently win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:37">[02:01:37]</a>, rather than outright banning them unless cheating is involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:33">[02:03:33]</a>.

## Other Gamblers

White mentions that [[dave_portnoys_experience_with_barstool_sports | Charles Barkley]] is also a gambler and won $650,000 at a Power Slap event after-party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:05">[03:37:05]</a>. He also notes that influencer Aiden Ross gambles high stakes, being "up a million, he's down 750, he's up a million five" within a Power Slap weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:01">[02:04:01]</a>. White dismisses rumors about Bruno Mars's gambling debts, stating that Mars "prints money" and that such rumors are often exaggerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:23">[02:04:23]</a>.

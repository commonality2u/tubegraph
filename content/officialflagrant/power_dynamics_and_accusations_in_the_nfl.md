Recent events involving NFL team owners have brought to light significant power dynamics and accusations within the league <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.

## The Case of Dan Snyder and the Washington Commanders

Dan Snyder, the owner of the Washington Commanders (formerly the Redskins), has been a contentious figure for about 20 years, with the team performing poorly since he took over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>. Snyder faces multiple accusations, including allegations of racism and sexual misconduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>. A congressional hearing is currently underway against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>.

Many believe Snyder is detrimental to the league, prompting other owners, who are typically tight-knit, to consider removing him due to the financial costs associated with his controversies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>.

## Allegations and Owner Collusion

In response to attempts to oust him, Snyder reportedly threatened to expose dirt on numerous other NFL owners, including [[Jerry Jones and the NFL | Jerry Jones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. An allegation against [[Jerry Jones and the NFL | Jerry Jones]] surfaced shortly after Snyder's threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. This suggests a "if I go down, we all going down" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>. The idea that a "super ethical billionaire does not exist" and that "everybody got dirt" is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.

If an owner is "fucking up the bag for everybody," then other owners might collude to get them out, even if it means snitching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

## The Commissioner's Role

The NFL [[Corporate and governmental power dynamics in the United States | commissioner]], Roger Goodell, has reportedly used his power to control the media in order to pressure Dan Snyder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>. For example, during a Thursday night football game, a commentator openly listed Snyder's scandals, which is unusual for NFL broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>. This tactic is believed to be the [[Corporate and governmental power dynamics in the United States | commissioner]]'s way of publicly urging Snyder to sell the team to avoid a more contentious removal process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>.

> Previous cases like Donald Sterling (NBA's Clippers) and the owner of the Carolina Panthers show that team owners can be forced to sell their franchises due to sexual misconduct allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications of NFL Owner Power

The discussions highlight that NFL owners wield significant power and primarily focus on financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. In contrast, NFL players are seen as having no power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. The situation with Snyder exemplifies how the league's hierarchy operates when controversies threaten financial stability and public image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

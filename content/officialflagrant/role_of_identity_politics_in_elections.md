## Democratic Party's Perception and Strategy

The perception of the Democratic Party is that it has been taken over by leftists focusing on [[identity_politics | identity politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:44">[01:37:44]</a>. This perception suggests that the party prioritizes "fringe groups" over the concerns of everyday working Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:44">[01:37:44]</a>. Regardless of the reality of their policies, the public's [[influence_of_media_and_perception_on_political_outcomes | perception]] portrays Democrats as "pretentious weirdos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. A key criticism is that Democrats are perceived as being "weird" and labeling anyone who questions this "weirdness" as a "Nazi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

Examples cited for this perception include:
*   Allowing transgender athletes who identify as women to compete and win against cisgender women in sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   Drag queens reading books to children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:05">[02:21:05]</a>.

This approach often leads to a backlash where people vote against what they perceive as "weirdness," especially when the party doesn't acknowledge or explain these stances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:54">[02:21:54]</a>.

> "The Democrats need to acknowledge that they're the party of acceptance, but sometimes they're accepting things that are a little out there for people, so they need to do a little explaining." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:12">[02:22:12]</a>

### Shift from Working Class to Identity Politics

An argument is made that traditional Democrats, influenced by political donors, deliberately shifted away from a working-class movement towards [[identity_politics | identity politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

#### The Bernie Sanders Effect
In 2016, Bernie Sanders led a popular movement focused on the working class and wealth inequality, without a racial component or other [[identity_politics | identity politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>. This "Democratic socialism" approach was so popular that traditional Democrats reportedly sought to undermine it by labeling his supporters ("Bernie Bros") as "sexist and racist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:26">[02:28:26]</a>. This strategy made the movement "radioactive" and prevented people from moving in that direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

This led the Democratic Party to pivot away from the working class, resulting in a loss of their support, including union backing, as seen in recent elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The party then focused on constantly appeasing "intersectionality folk" and various oppressed groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The challenge with this approach is that appeasing one group can disadvantage another (e.g., affirmative action helping some minorities but disadvantaging Asians), leaving the Democrats "frozen" and unable to satisfy any group fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This was evident in the Israel-Palestine conflict, where many traditional Democratic voters abstained or voted against the administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:03">[03:01:03]</a>.

### Voter Behavior and Campaign Focus

The **2024 election** demonstrated complex voter behavior in swing states, with many voters casting ballots for Democrats down-ballot but for Donald Trump for president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This suggests voters were not rigidly tied to one party's [[election_polarization_and_celebrity_endorsements | identity]] but rather made individual choices based on specific issues or dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

Kamala Harris's campaign heavily focused on abortion rights, despite widespread public support for these rights, voters often separated this issue from their presidential vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Many voted for abortion rights measures but still chose Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This indicates that focusing solely on one issue, even a highly supported one, without addressing other concerns can be detrimental to a campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Trump, in contrast, masterfully navigated the abortion issue by taking credit for overturning Roe v. Wade (appeasing anti-abortion voters) while also stating he would not impose a federal ban (giving hope to abortion-rights supporters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

### Internal Party Dynamics

Some observers attribute the Democrats' struggles to issues within their own party structure, specifically the superdelegate system in primaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This system allows party insiders to override the popular vote, preventing candidates who genuinely reflect the people's desires from emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This leads to a disconnect between the party's chosen candidates and the broader electorate, hurting their chances in general elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

> "The Democratic primary is shockingly not Democratic. It's not Democratic and it goes back to their pretentiousness. It's this hey we know what you guys need we know what's right. You guys are [\h__\h] dumb. Let's us handle this and we'll figure it all out." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>

In contrast, Republicans, without a superdelegate system, are forced to listen to the people's choices, even if the party establishment initially opposes them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)

The conversation extends to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, particularly in education. While acknowledging that these programs aim to uplift disenfranchised people, concerns are raised about their execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. For example, lower admission requirements for Black/Latino medical school applicants are discussed. While understanding the aim to connect with diverse patients, the concern is raised if it compromises the quality of care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

The perception is that DEI programs sometimes benefit wealthy "nepo baby" Black people who don't need the help, while disenfranchised poor white people are not afforded similar opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. It is suggested that focusing on socioeconomic status over race as a primary factor for assistance would be more equitable and broadly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

> "If it was socioeconomic over racial, if it's a tiebreaker, sure, poor white kid, poor black kid, give it to the poor black kid, I guess. But like a poor white kid not getting to take advantage does seem like..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>

The hosts humorously suggest that if programs focused purely on socioeconomic status, the "smartest race" might become apparent through merit, potentially leading to unforeseen social shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### Influence on Media and Campaigns

The power of left-wing media is highlighted, specifically its ability to create and push narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This influence can be used to control public perception and [[political_messaging_and_voter_engagement | voter engagement]], even if the underlying reality is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The podcast itself experienced this, as some people labeled them a "right-wing podcast" just for having Donald Trump as a guest, regardless of their actual views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>. This underscores the power of [[impact_of_media_narratives_on_elections | media narratives]] and how they shape [[influence_of_media_and_perception_on_political_outcomes | perception]] in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

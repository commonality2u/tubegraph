Reflecting on his fighting career and future endeavors, Israel Adesanya emphasizes the importance of visualization, authenticity, and continuous personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. He discusses the profound impact of his wins and losses, how he navigates fame, and his aspirations beyond the octagon.

## Career Milestones and Mindset

### Visualizing Success
Adesanya is a strong believer in visualization as a tool for manifesting success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. He recounts visualizing every aspect of a fight, from the knockout to the post-fight press conference, often doing so in the shower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This practice helps him feel the happiness of victory before it happens, and he hopes to share that feeling with everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This deep immersion allows him to enter a "flow state" where everything just happens naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

Before a significant fight in Miami, he wrote "April 8th Miami 2023: The greatest comeback in sporting history, written by me" on his mirror, affirming it daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>. This practice, combined with microdosing mushrooms for "primal self" connection, helped him tap into a deeper level of focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>.

### The Aftermath of Victory: Managing Emotions and Fame
Following a significant win, Adesanya's initial reaction was to seek solitude rather than immediately engage with media or public appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. He chose to spend days in his room, strategically "farming" social media metrics to leverage his increased visibility for future business opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. Upon returning home, he prioritized spending time with his dog, Toothless, as a way to [[Personal insights on lifestyle and managing fame | ground himself]] and return to his reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.

### Dealing with Public Perception and Authenticity
A significant aspect of Adesanya's journey involves shedding a "people-pleaser" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>. He recognized this tendency as a coping mechanism from his youth in New Zealand, where he sought acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a>. Now, he prioritizes [[Personal insights on lifestyle and managing fame | protecting his energy]] and is comfortable saying "no" without explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>. He views unsolicited requests for photos or autographs as an "entitlement," choosing not to reward stalking behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:29">[02:58:29]</a>.

His documentary, "Style Bender," offers a vulnerable, 360-degree view of who he is, including moments he might "cringe" at, but ultimately feels are "real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a>. He prefers meeting people who have no preconceived notions of him, allowing for more genuine interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>.

## Evolution as a Fighter

### Learning and Adapting
Adesanya has a strong commitment to constant evolution as a fighter. He consciously chose mixed martial arts (MMA) over kickboxing or boxing to prove himself as the "best fighter in the world," which required him to learn grappling and put his ego aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:51:00">[49:51:00]</a>. He openly discusses how previous losses to Alex Pereira pushed him to become a better fighter and athlete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:56">[02:25:56]</a>. He also shares insights from sparring with teammates, emphasizing the need for intense pressure during training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### The Importance of a Strong Team
His relationship with his coaches, particularly Eugene Bareman, is pivotal. Bareman's compliments are meaningful because he is a man of few words, and his emotional moments before fights resonate deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Adesanya highlights how Bareman, like a good coach, sometimes criticizes him publicly to motivate the whole team, but also knows when to pull back to avoid crushing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:30">[03:05:30]</a>. He also expresses immense gratitude for his teammates, acknowledging their hard work and contributions to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

### Spiritual and Mental Preparation
Adesanya emphasizes the spiritual aspect of his fights, particularly in his preparation for his rematch with Pereira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. He tapped into his Nigerian roots and heritage, even bringing a ceremonial chief staff (Uka) to weigh-ins, to connect with his "primal side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. He believes that the "flow state" he achieves in fighting is akin to spirituality or magic, where the brain releases chemicals that enhance performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>. This mental fortitude allows him to be "prepared to die" in the octagon, knowing that if he's ready to die, he's ready to kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>.

## Future Aspirations and Legacy

### Transitioning Beyond Fighting
Adesanya projects having "less than 20 fights left" in his career, but clarifies this is a ballpark figure, as he and Volkanovski are among the most active UFC fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:30">[02:56:30]</a>. He expresses a strong desire to transition to other ventures after fighting, including potentially acting, motion capture, voiceovers, and running his own production company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:30">[02:53:30]</a>. He has already turned down major motion pictures to prioritize his fighting career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:30">[02:53:30]</a>. He even has aspirations in music, stating he is "rapping this year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

### Impact on the Sport
Adesanya hopes that his career and the success of fighters like him will elevate the UFC to a status comparable to the NFL, where being a UFC fighter is a prestigious, full-time job that doesn't require additional work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>. He wants to see future fighters making "millions a fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. He believes in constantly taking on the "hardest guys" and challenging himself, valuing the experience over simply winning or losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:40">[02:55:40]</a>.

### Personal Growth and Family
Beyond fighting, Adesanya looks forward to starting a family and being a great dad, drawing inspiration from friends who are already raising children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:10">[01:49:10]</a>. He reflects on his own parents, who, despite not initially believing in his dream, always supported him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a>. Their confidence and support, combined with his own evolving self-awareness, have shaped his journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>.

## Final Thoughts
Adesanya sees his life as a continuous story, constantly being written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. He remains grateful for his journey, acknowledging the transformation from where he started to his current position as a champion and public figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:56">[02:02:56]</a>. His experiences, both in and out of the cage, have forged a unique path of self-discovery and resilience.

The [[USIsrael relationship and Middle East conflicts | Israel-Palestine conflict]] is an ongoing geopolitical issue, with the United States closely involved as an ally of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. Recent developments suggest a significant shift in dynamics within the region and the approach of key leaders.

## Current State of Affairs

*   **Netanyahu's Position** Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is currently in a precarious position, facing more risk than Russian President Putin during the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:29">[02:20:29]</a>. This is attributed to Israel being a functioning democracy with public transparency and calls for re-election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:32">[02:20:32]</a>.
    *   While there is support for Netanyahu, it is largely from a "narrow far-right support" base, whereas most of the country has adopted a moderate stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:51">[02:20:51]</a>.
    *   Initially, the conflict may have unified the country, but protests are now resuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:59">[02:20:59]</a>. This creates a small window of full support, and the longer it lasts, the riskier Netanyahu's position becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:14">[02:21:14]</a>.
    *   It was a [[Political discourse and criticism | political opportunity]] for Netanyahu to consolidate power amid existing divisiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:38">[02:21:38]</a>.
*   **Hamas and Palestinian Support** As a result of the conflict, Hamas has gained increased popularity and stronger support in both Gaza and the West Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:49">[02:21:49]</a>.
    *   It's emphasized that Palestinians and Hamas terrorists are distinct entities, despite media often using the terms interchangeably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>.
    *   Initially, news reports from October 2023 would cite "Hamas authorities" for casualty figures, but by March 2024, reports validated "Palestinian health authority" data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:18">[02:22:18]</a>. This validation of Hamas as a "valid government organization" is seen as tricky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>.
    *   Hamas has been the appointed political power in Gaza since 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:01">[02:23:01]</a>. Their growing popularity in the West Bank is particularly notable, as the West Bank has historically been supported by a US-backed Fatah government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:38">[02:23:38]</a>.

## U.S. Diplomacy and Implications

*   The U.S. administration, including the President, Vice President, and National Security head, invited Israel's opposition leader to the U.S. due to difficulties communicating with Netanyahu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
*   Biden and Netanyahu are currently "at odds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.
*   The U.S. advised Israel against planned airstrikes, urging them not to repeat American mistakes post-9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:22">[02:21:22]</a>.
*   The U.S. reclassified Hamas as a terrorist group in 2024 (after declassifying them in 2019), leading to a withdrawal of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:02">[02:19:02]</a>. However, this move alienated European allies like Turkey, France, and Spain, who continued to fund Hamas, leading to a "bound up" Biden administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:31">[02:19:31]</a>.

## Future Outlook

*   **Political Asylum:** It is predicted that both Ukrainian President Zelensky and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu may seek political sanctuary/asylum in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>. The U.S. "cannot let Zelensky die" as he represents democracy in Europe, and Putin is known to target opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:55">[02:25:55]</a>.
*   **Stalemate and Two-State Solution:** It's likely that a ceasefire will be called in Israel, leading to a prolonged period where a new normal emerges and a two-state solution returns to the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:54">[02:23:54]</a>.
    *   Both Zelensky and Netanyahu have made promises they cannot fulfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:31">[02:24:31]</a>. Zelensky cannot win the war to restore Ukraine's pre-war boundaries, and Netanyahu cannot "cleanse" Hamas or occupy Palestinian lands without exacerbating resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:35">[02:24:35]</a>.
    *   The next best outcome for these leaders is a prolonged stalemate, shifting global attention to a "different disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:27">[02:25:27]</a>.

> [!info] Proxy Wars and Geopolitical Shifts
> The U.S. strategy involves constant rotation of Special Operations groups for "active training in real-world conflict" through proxy wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:16">[02:28:16]</a>. This includes involvement in Somalia, Mogadishu, Colombia, and Peru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:22">[02:28:22]</a>. The presence of the "biggest kid in the playground" (U.S.) can unintentionally stoke more conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:18">[02:29:18]</a>. The U.S. will engage in these conflicts to protect its interests and train its forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>.

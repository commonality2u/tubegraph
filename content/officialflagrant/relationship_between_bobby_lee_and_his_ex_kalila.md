Bobby Lee and his ex-partner Kalila maintain a friendly relationship following their separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Despite no longer being together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, they remain very close friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, with Bobby stating that he will "always help her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Kalila is considered by Bobby to be in his "intimate circle" of friends, alongside his mother and brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## Post-Separation Dynamics

Discussions indicate Kalila was in the process of moving out of their shared home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, there's a playful suggestion that she might not actually move out because it's a "nice house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The conversation also touched upon the legal aspects of their separation, specifically regarding California's common-law marriage laws. Bobby asserts that there is no common-law marriage in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, which is affirmed by a quick search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He notes that rights for unmarried people living together only apply in situations where they share financial responsibilities, such as paying a mortgage together; if one person pays the mortgage, the other has fewer rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

## Reflections on Relationship Dynamics

Bobby has expressed a historical attraction to "poor" women whom he could "save," wanting to be their "knight in shining armor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> and ensure they were "security" and "couldn't go anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This perspective highlights a desire to be the provider and retain control in a relationship.

Bobby's struggles with addiction and sobriety also played a role in his relationship with Kalila. During a trip to Mexico, when Bobby was advised not to drink alcohol, a friend gave him a non-alcoholic drink to prevent a relapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Despite this, Bobby ended up getting drunk on his own, unbeknownst to his friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. This incident led to a significant low point, with Bobby throwing up and having feces on his hands in his hotel room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. He later admitted that this moment was a turning point, making him realize he "knew it was over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a> and that he "can't continue" with his addiction if he didn't want to "lose everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. This period of his life led to a renewed commitment to sobriety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

The hosts also touched on Bobby's overall [[relationship_dynamics_and_open_relationships|relationship philosophy]], noting his growth in being more open and connected. He has been more responsible and connected in his life, particularly after turning 50, a change he attributes to a fear of death after the passing of fellow comedians Bob Saget and Louie Anderson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>. This new chapter in his life is marked by a desire for freedom, joy, fun, and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>.

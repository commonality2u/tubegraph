From: [[officialflagrant]] <br/> 

Senator Bernie Sanders is presented as one of the few politicians who has "hasn't traded conviction for convenience" and has decades of experience fighting for working people against a system he believes was "built to screw you over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. He advocates for the dignity of working people, universal healthcare, and highlights that the system is not broken, but designed to favor the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Influence of Wealth and Corporations

Sanders' political views, particularly his opposition to [[the_influence_of_billionaires_in_politics | billionaires]], were significantly shaped by personal experience. As a young boy, he was deeply impacted by the Brooklyn Dodgers' move to Los Angeles in 1958, driven by "corporate greed" and disregard for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This event made him realize that entities so important to a community could be privately owned and moved for profit, affecting his political perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

He extends this criticism to modern professional sports, noting that teams owned by [[the_influence_of_billionaires_in_politics | billionaires]] often demand public funds for stadiums, threatening to relocate if not met, while "breaking the hearts of kids" and offering only low-paying, part-time jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:41">[03:32:41]</a>. As mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Sanders attempted to establish a municipally owned baseball team to prevent such issues, though the effort was ultimately unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:47">[04:28:47]</a>. He questions why cities fund stadiums without receiving equity in the teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

Sanders points out the vast wealth inequality in America, where 60% of people live paycheck to paycheck, facing immense stress over rent, healthcare, and unexpected expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. He highlights that America spends twice as much per person on healthcare as many European countries that guarantee free healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>, and that 68,000 people die annually due to delayed or avoided medical care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. He also notes the underpayment and lack of respect for childcare workers and public school teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>, contributing to a system where top university graduates are drawn to Wall Street over education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

### The Uber Capitalists' Mindset

Sanders believes there's a "new breed of uber capitalists" who see themselves as "superior human beings," entitled to their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>. He describes their philosophy as "to the victor go the spoils," where they believe their intelligence and hard work justify their immense fortunes while others struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. This mindset, he argues, diminishes democracy and suggests the wealthy have a right to rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>. He contrasts this with some ultra-wealthy individuals who decide to give away their money before or at death, suggesting an implicit admission that accumulating such vast wealth is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.

## Campaign Finance and Lobbying

A major driver of DC corruption, according to Sanders, is the "broken and corrupt campaign finance system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>.

### Citizens United and Super PACs

The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision ruled that advertising is a form of free speech, allowing [[the_influence_of_billionaires_in_politics | billionaires]] and corporations to spend "unlimited sums of money" on political ads through Super PACs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>. This creates a system where a single individual can contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to influence elections, as exemplified by Elon Musk's reported $270 million contribution to help [[patrick_bet_davids_perspective_on_political_figures_and_american_politics | Donald Trump]] get elected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>.

This financial leverage makes it "very hard for any Republican to sustain to stand up and authentically speak their mind" against powerful interests, as Super PACs can fund primary challenges to remove politicians who don't align with their agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:46:00">[23:46:00]</a>. Sanders experienced this within the Democratic party, noting how the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC, funded by [[the_influence_of_billionaires_in_politics | billionaires]], spends millions to defeat candidates who oppose military aid to Israel, often by making the candidate "radioactive" with negative ads unrelated to the actual policy issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>. He views this as "duplicitous" and undermining the democratic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>.

### Lobbying and Political Influence

Lobbyists, often former members of Congress, maintain close relationships with current politicians and their staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. They offer to "help you write legislation" and organize fundraisers, using their connections and financial power to influence policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

The pharmaceutical industry serves as a prime example:
*   It made \$100 billion in profit last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.
*   There are 1,500 paid lobbyists from drug companies in Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>.
*   Drug prices in the US are 5-8 times higher than in Canada or Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   Drug companies charge exorbitant prices even for easily manufacturable drugs, leading to preventable deaths in poorer countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>.
*   Until recently, the US was the only major country where Medicare couldn't negotiate drug prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

Sanders notes that while [[patrick_bet_davids_perspective_on_political_figures_and_american_politics | Trump]] recently signed an executive order to lower drug prices, its effectiveness is questionable, and Sanders' office plans to introduce legislation to ensure Americans pay no more than people in other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

### Political Stock Trading

The issue of politicians trading stocks while in office is also acknowledged as a form of perceived corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. While Sanders doesn't own stock and isn't sure how prevalent insider trading is among politicians, he acknowledges instances like [[patrick_bet_davids_perspective_on_political_figures_and_american_politics | Donald Trump's]] comments influencing stock prices, which make the public feel that insiders have an unfair advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

## Democratic Party Establishment

Sanders criticizes the Democratic Party establishment for being "out of touch with reality" and ignoring the struggles of working-class people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>. He states they often convey that the "status quo is working" and only propose minor changes, which he argues is "unsustainable" and leaves people feeling unheard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:34">[01:36:34]</a>. This detachment, he believes, pushes voters towards figures like [[patrick_bet_davids_perspective_on_political_figures_and_american_politics | Donald Trump]] who at least acknowledge that the system is broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>.

He recounts the "hatred" he and his supporters felt from the Democratic establishment during his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, despite having large, diverse rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:20">[01:43:20]</a>. He describes a clash between the establishment, composed of older, wealthier individuals, and his movement's younger, working-class, diverse supporters, with the establishment unwilling to "open the door" to them, even if it means losing elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:47">[01:43:47]</a>. Sanders clarifies that the "Bernie Bros" narrative was a "myth" created by the Democratic establishment with the help of corporate media to dismiss his movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>.

## Solutions and Vision

Sanders advocates for ending Citizens United to curb the influence of money in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a>. Within political parties, he suggests rules that disincentivize Super PAC support, such as matching funds for every dollar a Super PAC spends against a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>.

He emphasizes the need for a national discussion about societal values beyond wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:01">[01:49:01]</a>. He believes the goal should not be to become a [[the_influence_of_billionaires_in_politics | billionaire]], but to ensure everyone has a "decent standard of living" without worrying about basic needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:10">[01:52:10]</a>.

His vision includes:
*   **Universal Healthcare:** Expanding Medicare to cover everyone, eliminating out-of-pocket costs, deductibles, and premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>. He argues that this is achievable, citing European countries that do so while spending less per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.
*   **Revolutionizing Education:** Making education, from childcare to graduate school, tuition-free, especially for essential professions like doctors, nurses, and engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>. He advocates for fostering creativity and excitement in learning rather than rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>.
*   **Taxing the Wealthy:** He believes in very steep taxes on the ultra-rich, stating, "I happen to believe that we should not have [[the_influence_of_billionaires_in_politics | billionaires]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:34">[01:56:34]</a>. He asserts that America has "enough money in this country to do any goddamn thing you want to do" by redirecting funds from tax breaks for the rich and excessive military spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.
*   **Promoting Public Service:** Shifting cultural values to respect and reward professions that offer societal utility (e.g., teachers, nurses, construction workers) rather than solely focusing on financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a>. He asks, "who's doing more important work?" between a Wall Street trader and a kindergarten teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:05">[01:53:05]</a>.

Sanders believes that true change requires greater public participation and challenging the notion that individuals are powerless against powerful interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>. He is working to enlist and train new progressive candidates to run for office at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:22">[01:44:22]</a>.

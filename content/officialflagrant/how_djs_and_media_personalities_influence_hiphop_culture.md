DJs and media personalities play a significant role in shaping and influencing hip-hop culture, often acting as gatekeepers, trendsetters, and narrative drivers. Their platforms, ranging from traditional radio to expansive digital media, grant them unique power within the industry.

## The Power of Media Personalities

Figures like DJ Akademiks demonstrate the immense influence media personalities wield in hip-hop. Akademiks, referring to himself as "the ultimate prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a> and a "media personnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, emphasizes that artists should "never beef with the media" because the media ultimately controls the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:01">[01:59:01]</a>. He asserts his ability to amplify narratives, making an album "detrimental" if he chooses to portray it as "mid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>.

Akademiks highlights his "slow game" approach, observing the trajectory of artists' careers over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:43">[02:41:43]</a>. He has claimed to have [[impact_of_rap_beefs_in_hip_hop | negatively impacted]] a rapper's career, citing Meek Mill as an example, though they are now on good terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:34">[01:35:34]</a>.

Another example of this influence is Charlamagne Tha God, who gained significant recognition when [[Drake and media narratives | Drake]] mentioned him in his song "Back to Back," cementing him as "part of history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:04">[02:21:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:21">[02:53:21]</a>.

## Shaping Perceptions and Narratives

Media personalities can directly influence public perception. Akademiks notes that his content can lead to assumptions about his supporters, making him "deal with that perception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:03">[02:26:03]</a>. He cautions against losing control of one's narrative, as seen with Andrew Tate, stating, "you never let your mouthpiece get still" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:42">[02:14:42]</a>.

The ability to control a narrative is crucial, especially when facing controversy. Akademiks explains that if a public figure is "canceled," they become "what people say you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:37">[02:06:37]</a> because they lose platforms to explain themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:21">[02:06:21]</a>.

## The Role of Internet Creators

The rise of internet creators and streamers has shifted the landscape, as rappers now flock to them for platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>. However, there remains a "cool factor" to music that streamers currently lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:01">[01:54:01]</a>.

Akademiks suggests that artists like 6ix9ine, despite being a spectacle and financially successful through non-music ventures like playing FIFA for pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:39">[01:40:39]</a>, cannot maintain their cultural impact solely through vlogging. To truly influence culture, 6ix9ine needs to return to music, as his initial impact was unique and new within that realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:12">[01:49:12]</a>.

## Impact on Artist Behavior and Career Longevity

Media scrutiny and influence can affect how artists present themselves and manage their careers. The Atlanta rap scene, for example, faces a crackdown from the District Attorney, leading artists to be careful about what they rap about, as lyrics can be used against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. This impacts the kind of music artists like [[the_controversy_and_influence_around_lil_baby_and_his_music | Lil Baby]] can release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.

The desire for fame can also lead to problematic behavior, as seen with women seeking clout by associating with celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:41">[01:44:41]</a>. Akademiks emphasizes the importance of professional security over "homie security" for artists and media figures, as friends can become liabilities when dealing with public situations and potential threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:37">[03:33:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## Criticisms and Challenges

Despite their influence, media personalities face scrutiny and pushback. Akademiks notes that his jokes can be taken out of context and weaponized, leading to accusations of hatefulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:49">[02:18:49]</a>, highlighting the delicate [[media_portrayal_and_influence_of_public_personalities | connection between hiphop culture and public perception]] and the potential for misunderstanding when humor is not perceived as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:02">[02:19:02]</a>.

The rise of "counterculture" groups, fueled by distrust of mainstream narratives, also challenges media personalities. Akademiks acknowledges the frustration of these groups who feel lied to by mainstream media, leading them to reject official narratives about events like George Floyd's death or the financial dealings of politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:09">[02:22:09]</a>. However, he cautions that such a stance can become a personality trait, leading to "shitty behavior" that cannot be excused, even if rooted in trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:04">[02:24:04]</a>.

Akademiks also criticizes the lack of information sharing among rappers regarding their deals, leading to new artists signing similar unfavorable contracts as older artists. He suggests that a collective approach could empower artists to negotiate better terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:27">[03:07:27]</a>. He highlights that executives, like Scooter Braun who acquired Taylor Swift's masters, are often the ones truly accumulating wealth, underscoring the financial power dynamics at play within the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:03">[03:11:03]</a>.

He points to Taylor Swift as a "visionary" who understands how to leverage her fanbase and create an "experience" around her music, selling millions of physical albums rather than relying solely on streaming, which ultimately gives her more power in negotiations with streaming companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:51">[03:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>. This contrasts with rappers who, due to fears of leaks and a focus on immediate streaming numbers, are less able to replicate such long-term strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:45">[03:15:45]</a>.

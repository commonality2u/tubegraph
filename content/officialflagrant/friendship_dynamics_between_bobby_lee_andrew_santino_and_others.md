## Core Friendships

### Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino
The relationship between [[Bobby Lee]] and [[Andrew Santino]] is marked by deep affection, despite their frequent on-air jabs and competitive banter. [[Bobby Lee]] considers [[Andrew Santino]] one of his best friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. This sentiment is mutual, with [[Andrew Santino]] acknowledging [[Bobby Lee]]'s love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. Their bond is described as akin to "army veterans" in a shared "war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

Their dynamic is often comedic, featuring:
*   **Improvised Scenarios**: They frequently engage in hypothetical acting scenes, often with comedic twists.

Similarly, a serious scene about an asteroid turns into listing favorite movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.
*   **Playful Jealousy**: There's a running gag about [[Andrew Santino]]'s annoyance if [[Bobby Lee]] gets recognized more or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. [[Bobby Lee]] claims [[Andrew Santino]] "hates it" when people recognize him and not [[Bobby Lee]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Support and Sobriety
[[Andrew Santino]] has been a significant support for [[Bobby Lee]] in his journey towards sobriety.

This act, while initially causing [[Bobby Lee]] to get angry, was an attempt to save him from relapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. [[Bobby Lee]] later relapsed on his own in the hotel room, leading to a memorable, messy incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

[[Bobby Lee]] is currently seven months sober <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

He sometimes feels like an "ethnic sidekick" or "wacky neighbor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. Despite the teasing, there's an underlying respect, with [[Bobby Lee]] acknowledging Akash's efforts to reach out via text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

### Circles of Friendship

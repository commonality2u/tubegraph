Dave Portnoy's pizza reviews have had a significant and sometimes transformative impact on local businesses, particularly small, independent pizzerias. What began as an organic process has grown into a phenomenon that can drastically alter a business's daily operations and public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>.

## The Popularity and Credibility of Reviews

The pizza review series gained immense popularity, even leading to hyperbolic claims of "shutting down the city in Toronto" due to its influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>. A key factor in their impact is the perceived honesty and organic nature of the reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. Portnoy states that he gives honest reviews, even if a place is bad, which helped establish his credibility as a "credible pizza" critic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>.

The reviews especially "took off in New York" because they authentically showcased the city's unique characters who would spontaneously interact during the reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>. This unscripted interaction adds to the appeal, giving viewers a "real feel of New Yorkers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.

## Direct Business Impact

The most immediate and tangible effect of a positive review is a significant increase in sales. If a pizza place receives a score "above an eight," it can lead to them "run[ning] out dull by noon" the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>. This rapid sell-out is described as "amazing" and "great" for the businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

The reviews have spawned a "pizza tour" phenomenon, where people, including those from out of town, follow Portnoy's recommendations to visit the reviewed pizzerias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. People use the Barstool app to guide them to places Portnoy has visited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>.

Portnoy enjoys seeing "mom and pop" shops potentially "blow up" after a good review, recognizing the "American success story" aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:29">[01:09:29]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations and Reviewer's Approach

While the reviews are generally positive in intent, Portnoy acknowledges that he has changed his approach to negative reviews. He now refrains from "trash[ing]" a place by giving extremely low scores (like a 2.4), even if he thinks the pizza is terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. This shift is partly due to the fact that all pizza places now recognize him, making it harder to be completely harsh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>.

Despite the potential for a "god complex" due to his ability to impact livelihoods, Portnoy maintains a grounded perspective, attributing it to his background and the fact that he didn't achieve significant financial success with Barstool until his late 20s or early 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. He still feels uncomfortable cutting lines, remembering his past experiences waiting in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.

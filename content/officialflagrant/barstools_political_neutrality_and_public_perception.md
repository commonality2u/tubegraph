Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy has frequently discussed the perception of Barstool's political stance, asserting its neutrality while acknowledging how external factors, particularly media interactions and past content, shape public opinion.

## Striving for Apolitical Stance
Portnoy states that Barstool tries to remain apolitical, citing the "Michael Jordan quote" that "Republicans buy sneakers too" to illustrate their business-first approach to content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The primary goal is to make money, and delving into politics risks alienating portions of their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. He describes Barstool as primarily a comedy site, aiming to make people laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.

Despite this intention, Portnoy admits that his own appearances and interviews can lead to Barstool being perceived as politically affiliated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>.

## Impact of Political Interactions
Portnoy's interview with Donald Trump is a key example of how his personal actions influenced Barstool's public image. He noted that the interview disarmed Trump, who initially didn't know much about Portnoy, by starting with a compliment about a past interaction, making Trump view him as "friendly fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. During this interview, Portnoy claims to have been the only person to get Trump to admit he made a mistake with tweeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

However, the interview contributed to the perception of Barstool as politically aligned:
> "If you go on Fox, you're Hitler. It's a matter of what you say on Fox, if you're going to Tucker Carlson, they perceive you as Hitler." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>

Portnoy clarified that he would go on any platform, including CNN, if invited, because his goal is to grow Barstool's audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.

### Personal Political Views
Portnoy emphasizes that his own political views do not fit neatly into traditional left or right categories. He states he "hates the extreme left" and "hates the extreme right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>. He also openly stated he would not vote for Trump again due to his divisiveness, and holds a negative view of President Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.

He holds strong progressive stances on certain social issues, for example, being pro-choice:
> "I would never tell a woman what to do with their body. I think it's insane that you would ever try to overturn that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18:00">[27:18:00]</a>
Despite these views, he receives "nothing" in support from the political left, who he feels "just want to rip [his] throat out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a>. This phenomenon has led him to understand sentiments expressed by figures like [[the_role_of_media_and_politics_in_shaping_public_perception | Elon Musk]], who feel the left is making them "hate the left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>. He recognizes the risk of being "totally winged" if he only accepts embrace from one side, which could alienate middle-ground or left-leaning fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[28:08:00]</a>.

## Media Perceptions and Misinterpretations
Barstool's growth and changing [[us_political_dynamics_and_influence_of_media | US political dynamics and influence of media]] have led to their content sometimes being taken out of context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:52:00">[36:52:00]</a>. Portnoy asserts that many criticisms stem from people who haven't actually consumed Barstool's content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

### Past Controversies
Several incidents have contributed to external perceptions:
*   **The "N-word" Clip:** A clip of Portnoy singing a song containing the N-word during a Ja Rule and Ashanti announcement in 2017 resurfaced during the Black Lives Matter movement years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>. Portnoy admits he wouldn't do it again but maintains there was "no hate in it" and that he wasn't caught doing it privately, but rather put it out himself without hearing criticism for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>.
*   **Colin Kaepernick Discussion:** An old clip discussing Colin Kaepernick's protests was cut to make Portnoy appear racist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:18:00">[24:18:00]</a>. Portnoy clarifies that the full conversation acknowledged Kaepernick's right to protest police brutality and the need for change in how police interact with the African-American community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>. He distinguishes peaceful protest from looting and fund hijacking, stating:
    > "Looting is bad, at any time. Anytime there's silent protest, let it go. That's what this country's built on." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32:00">[24:32:00]</a>
*   **Harvey Weinstein Hypothetical:** A discussion about the Harvey Weinstein scandal, prefaced by calling him a "scumbag" deserving of jail, was clipped to imply support for willing "trades" between Hollywood agents and young actresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:00">[32:40:00]</a>. Portnoy argues the discussion was a hypothetical about consensual trades, not a defense of Weinstein's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:48:00">[32:48:00]</a>.
*   **AOC and Unions:** Portnoy's long-standing rivalry with *Deadspin* led him to mock their failed unionization effort, which was then seized upon by AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) as an "anti-union" stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>. Portnoy had to issue a formal apology to the National Labor Relations Board, stating Barstool employees could form a union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_media_and_politics_in_shaping_public_perception | The role of media and politics in shaping public perception]]
Portnoy argues that Barstool is often targeted by publications like *Business Insider* due to its perceived political alignment and influence. He believes these outlets, which he calls "trash," aim for "salacious headlines for clicks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. He notes they often target figures like Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, and Trump, suggesting they go after people they perceive as politically aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>. He claims *Business Insider*'s model is known for clickbait, and that they often rely on vague accusations and a lack of due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

He attributes this targeting to fear of influence:
> "If politicians are seeing the amount of like power you actually have to like sway public opinion and they don't have a way to control you, they have to make you radioactive." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>

Despite these challenges, Portnoy maintains that Barstool's foundation, built "brick by brick" through hard work and being transparent, allows them to withstand controversies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:49">[01:28:49]</a>. He believes that people who truly know him understand his genuine intentions and multifaceted views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>.

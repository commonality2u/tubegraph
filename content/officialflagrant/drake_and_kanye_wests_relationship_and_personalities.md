It is suggested that [[Kanye West]] is currently "using the black community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This perspective implies that [[Kanye West]] leverages the community for his own benefit, much like a "side chick" who gains attention during a main relationship's turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.

**Controversial Statements and Backlash**
[[Kanye West]]'s controversial statements, such as his comments regarding George Floyd's death, are highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. These statements often lead to significant backlash, including his cancellation by Adidas, which he initially believed wouldn't happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Despite public outrage, some individuals, particularly those who distrust mainstream narratives, view [[Kanye West]] as a "hero" for challenging the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. The podcast hosts recall roasting [[Kanye West]] during a previous episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

**Mental Health and Desire for Control**
The consensus is that [[Kanye West]] is dealing with mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.

**Business Relationships and Financial Impact**
Concerns about [[Kanye West]]'s financial stability and business relationships, including his banking issues with JP Morgan, are discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:31">[02:26:31]</a>.

MrBeast, also known as Jimmy, has discussed a variety of ambitious future plans, ranging from political aspirations to expanding his business empire and evolving his content creation strategy.

## Political Aspirations

MrBeast finds the idea of being president appealing when he is around 40 or 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. He believes a strong campaign strategy would involve becoming a billionaire, then giving away all his money to declare, "I can't be bought," with "literally 0 in my bank account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. His goal would then be to "just do what's best for people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> and ignore lobbyists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>, as the presidential salary of $400,000 per year would be enough for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>. He thinks he could win by his mid-40s due to his ability to "get people's attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. He acknowledges that this idea of becoming president after giving away all wealth has been compared to [[Trumps reflections on his presidency and future aspirations | Donald Trump's rhetoric]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.

## Business Ventures

MrBeast plans to continue his work on YouTube for the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>. Beyond that, he envisions a future where he primarily runs his various companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>. He enjoys both creating content and running businesses, finding the latter "a lot of fun" and generally easier than constantly striving to "break the internet every week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>.

He currently operates several successful ventures:
*   **Beast Burger**
    *   Has opened its first physical location, generating approximately $30,000 per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>.
    *   He aims to eventually make Beast Burger entirely plant-based, moving towards 3D-printed or synthetically grown meat options that taste identical to traditional meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:28">[01:51:28]</a>.
*   **Feastables (Chocolate Bars)**
    *   Are now available in every Walmart, performing exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>.
    *   The branding alone drives significant sales, with over $100,000 in sales on a recent day just from being in a fraction of Walmart stores, without any prior promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:38">[02:17:38]</a>.
*   **Mobile Game Company**
    *   He intends to start a mobile game company, attracted by the "infinite scalability" of software, which avoids the logistical challenges of managing physical inventory like burgers and chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:48">[01:50:48]</a>. He believes this is his next major focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:11">[01:51:11]</a>.

MrBeast has been offered around a billion dollars for his YouTube channel and all his companies, an offer he finds "enticing" but is reluctant to accept if it means working for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:23">[02:55:23]</a>. He believes his collective ventures could be worth 10 to 20 billion dollars in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:48">[02:56:48]</a>. He predicts that within the next year, several YouTubers will become billionaires through their companies, which will cause larger industries to take their influence seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>. His ultimate goal is for his companies to be so successful that he only promotes his own products on his channel, effectively acting as a "Super Bowl ad every video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:21">[02:17:21]</a>.

## Content Strategy and Evolution

MrBeast plans to maintain his focus on YouTube, which he sees as the dominant platform for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:13">[02:20:13]</a>. He believes YouTube will continue to grow, and his goal is to remain the "biggest YouTuber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:36">[02:21:36]</a>. He constantly adapts to YouTube's algorithm changes, stating that he trusts Google's platform-building capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:50">[02:21:50]</a>.

He anticipates diversifying his content to appeal to a broader, potentially older audience:
*   **Collaborations**: He plans to feature more well-known figures like The Rock in his videos to attract a wider demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>.
*   **Episodic Content**: He aims to create episodic content, such as a Netflix show that fills a stadium with 10,000 people and eliminates 10% each episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:18">[02:58:18]</a>. This format is better suited for platforms like Netflix, which excel at long-form, multi-episode series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:40">[02:58:40]</a>.
*   **Animations**: He wants to make short animated films, similar to Pixar, with "funny ass ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:12">[02:59:12]</a>. One concept involves a "Saw-level story" where 100 YouTubers compete on an island with real weapons for ownership of the island, with a "dark" tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:28">[02:59:28]</a>.
*   **Antarctica Video**: He plans to go to Antarctica with [[Logan Pauls ventures in WWE and entrepreneurship | Logan Paul]] and Casey Neistat to climb an unclimbed mountain and be the first to do a podcast there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:02">[03:16:02]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of continuous innovation in content to stay relevant, contrasting it with creators who "milk it till it dies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:16">[03:44:16]</a>.

## Philanthropic Goals

MrBeast intends to continue his philanthropic efforts, learning how to run initiatives like his food pantry from a young age so he has "decades of experience" when he accumulates more wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:14">[02:01:14]</a>. He hopes to start new charities and businesses, potentially hiring and running them with homeless individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:18">[02:01:18]</a>. One planned video involves helping a thousand people regain their eyesight, driven by the fact that many can't see "because they just don't have money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:57">[03:15:57]</a>. He finds personal satisfaction in helping others, stating it "feels better than any car, feels better than any shirt or any expensive pair of pants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:37">[03:05:37]</a>. He believes this goodwill distinguishes his brand, encouraging people to support his products over others because his earnings will be reinvested into his employees and charity rather than personal luxuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:43">[02:18:43]</a>.

## Team and Channel Future

MrBeast has a plan for his channel's future after his death: his core team members (Carl, Chandler, Chris, and potentially Nolan and Tariq) will place their hands on his tombstone, and the last one to take their hand off will inherit the entire channel and company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This event is expected to be filmed publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

He has trained a CEO to effectively "be him" in terms of running the company, prioritizing coachability, shared values, and obsessiveness in his hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. He continues to house his company heads in his new home to foster constant communication and creative alignment, ensuring they understand his vision as a "creative extension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. Despite the growth, he affirms that he must always be in the videos himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>.

MrBeast has pre-scheduled "hide me in" videos that will be released years into the future, with the next one, "Hide me in 10 years," set to go live in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:38">[03:28:38]</a>. He also has one scheduled for when he's 69 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:03">[03:30:03]</a>.

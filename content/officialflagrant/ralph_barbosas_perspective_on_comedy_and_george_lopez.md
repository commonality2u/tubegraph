Ralph Barbosa discusses his relationship with established comedians like George Lopez, reflecting on generational differences in [[comedy_and_standup | comedy]] appreciation and the evolving landscape of the [[comedy_industry_insights_and_career_reflections | comedy industry]].

## Early Encounters with George Lopez
Ralph Barbosa recounts a surprising phone call from George Lopez, where Lopez introduced himself, prompting Barbosa's initial startled reaction [00:00:00]. This conversation stemmed from a perceived "beef" that Barbosa clarifies he didn't view as such [00:00:53]. Barbosa had released an edited video, a "director's cut," inspired by *Carlito's Way*, which he found humorous [00:01:07].

The reason for the video was that as Barbosa began touring, people would often tell him he was "the next George Lopez" [00:01:22]. His pre-existing response to such comparisons, even before this specific incident, was often dismissive of established comedians [00:01:27]. He generally found it amusing that audiences assumed he looked up to figures like George Lopez [00:02:00].

## Generational Differences in Comedy Appreciation
Barbosa, being 26, explains that he didn't grow up watching George Lopez [00:02:08]. Even when he did see Lopez's [[comedy_and_standup | comedy]], he "didn't get it" [00:02:21]. He found Lopez funny but wasn't compelled to watch his specials or shows [00:02:40].

He draws a parallel to the experience of older generations discovering [[comedy_and_standup | comedy]]:
> "[[comedy_and_standup | Comedy]] you need [[comedy_and_standup | comedy]] within the context of time because this is how I felt about Pryor because I saw Eddie first so everybody would tell me oh my God Pryor's the truth he's the greatest ever and I grew up on Eddie so when I saw Pryor I was like nah he's not [\h__\h] with Eddie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>

The discussion highlights how [[comedy_and_standup | comedy]] evolves. While George Lopez's early specials were groundbreaking for Mexicans seeing their experiences reflected on platforms like HBO [00:03:36], younger comedians like Barbosa have grown up with decades of diverse [[comedy_and_standup | comedy]], making earlier material seem less fresh [00:03:54]. Barbosa found Lopez's frequent use of phrases like "Latinos, you know us" to be "the corniest line in the world" [00:04:37].

The analogy is made to hip-hop, where older rap might seem "simple" to younger listeners who are accustomed to later developments [00:05:01]. George Lopez's impact was significant because "nobody was talking to them Mexican comedian" [00:05:51], enabling future comedians like Barbosa to be "a comedian that's Mexican" rather than solely a "Mexican comedian" [00:06:01].

## The "Beef" with George Lopez
George Lopez contacted Barbosa after a podcast segment where Lopez made disparaging remarks about Barbosa [00:06:24]. Barbosa was "starstruck" by the call [00:06:56]. Lopez apologized, explaining he was "in the heat of the moment" during a conversation with Steve Trevino [00:07:22]. Lopez extended an offer of help if Barbosa ever needed it [00:08:06]. Barbosa noted that many online felt Lopez should issue a public apology, but Barbosa disagreed, believing a private apology was more genuine [00:07:50].

It's suggested that Lopez's initial reaction stemmed from being constantly compared to younger comedians [00:10:32]. Lopez had previously stated on his podcast that he doesn't help other comedians [00:11:20], indicating a general stance rather than specific animosity towards Barbosa [00:11:28].

## General Philosophy on Comedy and Mentorship
Barbosa holds respect for comedians but doesn't idolize them before meeting them personally [00:09:51]. He is open to taking advice from anyone [00:09:34]. He observes that established comedians, like George Lopez or Dave Chappelle, can react negatively when new talent is praised in front of them, as they prefer to hear about their own funniness [00:14:26].

## The Impact of Social Media
Barbosa acknowledges that his success, including touring, is largely due to [[comedy_industry_insights_and_career_reflections | social media]] and YouTube [00:41:00]. He initially disliked platforms like Instagram and TikTok but became more motivated to post content after a "Don't Tell [[comedy_and_standup | Comedy]]" taping [00:40:27]. He believes the internet allows talented people to be seen quicker, bypassing traditional gatekeepers [00:41:11]. He appreciates the "raw feeling" of [[comedy_and_standup | comedy]] clips online compared to heavily edited specials [00:41:58].

## Aspirations and Personal Reflections
Despite his growing fame, Barbosa expresses a desire for a career where he could "make a living doing stand-ups you can do the clubs and make a living and just nobody even knows who you are" [00:44:34]. He finds being recognized publicly challenging due to his preference for solitude and past experiences of being "talked [\h__\h] to" in his family and at the barbershop [00:45:28]. He jokingly likens his approach to [[comedy_and_standup | comedy]] to that of a drug dealer â€“ operating low-profile, making money, and not being too flashy [00:48:48].

His recommended piece of [[comedy_and_standup | comedy]] is his 20-minute set with "Entree Knows" on HBO [00:50:13].

DJ Akademiks believes that [[kanye_wests_controversies | Kanye West]] is currently using the Black community [00:00:02, 03:59:23]. He describes this as a form of manipulation, akin to how a "side chick" gains attention when there are issues with a "main chick" [04:00:54]. Even when Kanye is without anyone, the Black community is still treated as the "side chick," made to feel special but ultimately used to serve his "ultimate goal" [04:00:54, 04:43:00].

## Allegations of Exploitation and Control
Akademiks asserts that [[kanye_west_controversies_and_public_behavior | Kanye West]] has an "innate urge to try to create a cult" and achieve "complete control" over his followers, rather than being primarily motivated by money [04:08:08, 04:12:00, 04:13:00]. He points out that Kanye has already "controlled the rap game" [04:18:00].

Akademiks cites instances of Kanye's controversial public behavior as evidence of his manipulative tactics:
*   Kanye's claim that George Floyd died from fentanyl, not a knee on his neck [03:59:33].
*   His subsequent flip-flop, admitting that a knee on the neck could be fatal after facing consequences like Adidas canceling their partnership [03:59:33, 04:03:00]. This situation highlighted for Kanye "what it could cost" [04:03:00].

## Response to Controversies
Akademiks discusses how Kanye's actions have drawn both support and criticism, particularly from those who feel lied to by mainstream narratives. When Kanye suggested that George Floyd died from fentanyl, he became a "hero" to certain "anti-establishment" groups [02:21:46, 02:22:03]. However, Akademiks draws a line, stating that while he shares a distrust of mainstream media regarding certain issues, he doesn't extend this to factual matters like George Floyd's death or antisemitic tropes [02:22:32, 02:23:06].

Akademiks also notes that when news related to Kanye's financial and business relationships (like JP Morgan discontinuing services or Good Music's separation from Def Jam) came out, the timeline of these events was often disregarded to fit a convenient narrative of punishment for his public statements [02:26:31, 02:27:28, 02:28:10]. This, he argues, is a common issue with "counterculture folks" who "don't look into the details that don't work for them" [02:35:50, 02:37:34, 02:38:10].

## Kanye's Mental State
Akademiks explicitly states his belief that [[kanye_wests_controversies | Kanye West]] is dealing with mental illness [03:59:16]. He implies this is widely recognized, stating, "I think we all know that though" [03:59:20].

## Comparison to Other Influencers
Akademiks contrasts Kanye's influence with others, including [[how_djs_and_media_personalities_influence_hiphop_culture | Charlamagne Tha God]]. He recounts how [[charlamagne_on_kanye_west_and_adidas | Charlamagne's]] joke about [[kevin_durant_brooklyn_nets | Kevin Durant]] and Kanye's mental state drew backlash because Charlamagne is expected to deliver "serious takes" [03:21:21]. This differs from comedians who can use humor to tackle sensitive topics [02:08:04]. Akademiks criticizes [[kevin_durant_brooklyn_nets | Kevin Durant]] for only making a "keyboard warrior" comment instead of using his "actual power" to help Kanye [03:32:44, 03:32:57].

Akademiks ultimately views Kanye as having unique "influence where companies were responding to her [Taylor Swift's] letters" [03:15:13].# DJ Akademiks' Views on Kanye West's Impact on the Black Community

From: [[officialflagrant]] <br/> 

Vivek Ramaswamy defines the "deep state" not as a group of individuals, but as a systemic issue, a "machine" or "system" where unelected bureaucrats wield significant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. He prefers the term "managerial class" over "deep state" or "shadow government" because the latter sound conspiratorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This "managerial class" refers to the hired middle management bureaucracy designed to administer what creators build, with the intention of serving constituents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## The Managerial Class: A Detailed View
According to Ramaswamy, the balance of power has vastly shifted towards this managerial class across various sectors, including corporate America, universities, and particularly the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. He argues that elected officials in government have almost nothing to do with what actually impacts most people's everyday lives, compared to this permanent machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This system is "fundamentally agnostic to the political party of who's on top as long as they're going to keep the party going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The core problem is the "dissipation of accountability," as the managerial class lacks accountability to constituents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

He likens the situation to a "principal-agent problem" in corporate law, where the hired agent (management) eventually behaves in ways that benefit themselves, like private jet use at the owner's expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. He further explains how large asset managers like BlackRock aggregate public money from 401K accounts and pension funds, then, acting as "shareholders," impose policies that are in their own interest, not the actual capital providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Critique of Political Opponents
Ramaswamy asserts that politicians like Nikki Haley and Joe Biden are "products of the deep state," representing a philosophy where "whatever it takes to accumulate an added ounce of money and power is what we're going to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This includes projecting American power abroad, creating American weakness, fighting foreign wars, and establishing a domestic surveillance state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. He criticizes Haley for advocating policies like tying social media accounts to government-issued IDs to use the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>, which he sees as a form of [[social_credit_systems_and_surveillance_states|social credit system]]. He describes Haley as the "modern avatar" of the post-9/11 "Dick Cheney George Bush Patriot Act Iraq war fuming Republicans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions: Dismantling the Bureaucracy
Ramaswamy's proposed solution is to "dismantle" the bureaucracy, using a "jackhammer" or "chainsaw" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. He plans to lay off 75% of the federal bureaucracy over his first term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. The first four agencies he would shut down are the FBI, ATF, CDC, and the US Department of Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. He acknowledges this involves risk, but prefers the risk of "cutting some muscle" over "not cutting enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
Ramaswamy calls the FBI the "Failed Bureau of Investigation," arguing it has been "rotten since its inception" and failed its basic law enforcement functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. He cites its historical actions, such as collecting tapes of Martin Luther King and threatening him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, and its current pursuit of political opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. He specifically mentions the FBI's alleged role in influencing election processes and instigating January 6th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

His plan involves:
*   Sending home 20,000 "back office bureaucrats" who constitute the typical managerial class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.
*   Moving the 15,000 "cops on the front lines" or "investigative agents" to other agencies like the US Marshals or the DEA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. He notes the US Marshals are more effective at combating child sex trafficking rings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   Moving financial crime enforcement to the US Treasury's FinCEN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

### Department of Education
The Department of Education was created in the post-desegregation era to prevent southern states from siphoning money from predominantly Black school districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. However, Ramaswamy contends that it has since become a "rot of itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>, focusing on enforcing "equality" through affirmative action, racial quotas, and the modern DEI agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

His solution is to:
*   Abolish the Department of Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.
*   Return its $80 billion budget directly to the states and parents, empowering parents to choose where their children attend school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.
*   Shift vocational training functions to the Department of Labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

## Philosophical Underpinnings
Ramaswamy's views are rooted in the idea of recapturing the essence of the American Revolution, which he states was fought on the principle that "we the people still decide who governs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. He believes that for most of human history, the idea that people would speak their minds, cause a government accountable to them, or have an equally weighted vote, was considered "nutty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. The managerial class, he argues, operates with a "benevolent conceit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>, believing that people are "idiots" and cannot be trusted to make good decisions for themselves, thus justifying their interventions to "save humanity" from itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of honesty and free speech, especially in times of crisis, arguing that "the government doesn't trust the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, leading to a "squandered" two-way relationship of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. To heal the country, he suggests government leaders must disclose truths, admit lies, explain why they lied, and outline how they will prevent future deceit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. Similarly, he believes the media needs to acknowledge their own falsehoods and commit to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

He promotes **individual accountability** and self-reliance, comparing the current situation to a "nation of sheep" that "breeds this managerial class of wolves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. He believes this is a "1776 moment," a time for a "modern Declaration of Independence" from both external shackles of the managerial class and internal limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

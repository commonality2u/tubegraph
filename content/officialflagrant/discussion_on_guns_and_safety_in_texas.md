The interviewee, who hails from Texas, frequently discusses his perspectives on gun ownership and personal safety, highlighting a stark contrast with other regions like New York and California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. His views are deeply rooted in his upbringing and experiences in Texas, where gun culture is prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Personal Gun Ownership and Philosophy
The speaker states he always carries an onion and a firearm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He describes driving in Texas with two ARs (assault rifles) in the car – one in the passenger seat and one in the back seat – along with a pistol on his left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. He feels incomplete without a gun, even stating he would leave his wallet before his firearm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. His personal checklist includes wallet, cell phone, and gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. He even goes to church with his gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Sense of Security
The speaker emphasizes that his **safety** becomes dependent on carrying a gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. He recalls feeling like a "superhero" after shooting a gun at a range because his baseline is usually without a gun, and having one made him feel "incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Justification for Carrying
His rationale for constant armament stems from perceived threats and the need for self-preservation. He references an incident in "Chi-Raq" (Chicago) where a man died, and the opposition stole his casket and body from the funeral, reinforcing his belief that "ain't out here friendly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

He recounts an instance at a "land party" (parties held on large rural properties) where he pulled out a large AR-15 with a drum magazine to de-escalate a situation with drug-addled individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. He explains that he prefers not to fight and would rather use the gun as a deterrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. He describes the intimidating appearance of his AR-15, which he says "came from the aliens" and has "titties on that muff" and "bullet drums" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Regional Differences in Safety Perception
While in Texas, the speaker feels safe due to his ability to carry firearms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. However, upon arriving in New York, he notes the difference, humorously implying he "snuck in all the guns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. He specifically mentions feeling less safe and stressed in California, believing that "everybody's out to get me" there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Controversial Views on Deterrence
The speaker shares a conversation with someone in California who believed that more widespread gun ownership would be beneficial because "some bodies might die, but it's okay because examples have to be made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This philosophy suggests that violence can serve as a deterrent, preventing future conflicts, akin to dynamics observed in prisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Other Aspects of Texas Life and Violence
*   **Hog Hunting:** He describes hog hunting in Texas, where wild hogs are considered a nuisance that destroys land and crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. The government allows killing them "however you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. The speaker engages in this activity using firearms, sometimes leaving the killed hogs for other animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
*   **Family Background:** His mother and her partner dealt drugs, and his mother was an "enforcer," demonstrating a need for toughness in their environment in Palacios and Bay City, Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:03">[02:43:03]</a>. Women in these areas faced significant dangers, including being "picked up off the tracks, beat the fuck up and raped under the bleachers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:33">[02:44:33]</a>. This background further underscores the perceived necessity of self-defense and toughness in certain Texas communities.

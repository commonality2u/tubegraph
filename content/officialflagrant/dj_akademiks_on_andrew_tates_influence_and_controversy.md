DJ Akademiks discusses his views on [[andrew_tates_social_media_strategy_and_mlm_scheme | Andrew Tate's]] influence, content, and the controversies surrounding him, including his content strategy and his conversion to Islam.

## Tate's Content and Image
Akademiks notes that when it comes to [[andrew_tates_social_media_strategy_and_mlm_scheme | Andrew Tate]], the issue wasn't necessarily what he was saying, but *how* he was packaging it, stating Tate packaged it "better than anybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Akademiks mentions observing the "Tate Brothers" on a Rumble show, where they discussed misperceptions of misogyny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:57">[01:37:57]</a>. He highlights that Tate was trying to make it seem as if the things he was saying were not jokes but real ideologies, which he believes was Tate's mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:04">[02:05:04]</a>.

Akademiks considers Tate a smart and funny individual who is also thoughtful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:54">[02:05:54]</a>. Tate's rise to fame was meteoric due to his "salacious" content and unique packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:11">[02:07:11]</a>. Akademiks suggests that if Tate had reduced the salaciousness of his content by 20-40%, his rise might not have been as fast, but he still would have risen due to being an engaging and entertaining speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:40">[02:08:40]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Figures and "Cult" Ideology
Akademiks likens [[andrew_tates_social_media_strategy_and_mlm_scheme | Andrew Tate's]] innate urge to create a "cult" to that of other musicians like Kanye West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. He emphasizes that for such figures, the goal is "complete control," not necessarily money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. He contrasts Tate's goal of controlling thinking and ideology with Nicki Minaj, who he says merely seeks unconditional love from her fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. He also recalls XXXTentacion believing millions would commit suicide if something happened to him, which Akademiks connects to a desire to control an audience and project an image of indispensable importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.

## Tate's Ban and Loss of Narrative Control
Akademiks believes [[andrew_tates_controversial_presence_and_hospitalization | Andrew Tate]] was banned because of his influence on "impressionable minds" and his assertion that his content was "real," providing a blueprint for a certain lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:20">[02:05:20]</a>. He argues that Tate's miscalculation was losing control of his narrative by being banned from major platforms like YouTube and Twitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:56">[02:05:56]</a>. When canceled, individuals are at the "whim" of others, unable to articulate their views freely, as seen in Tate's interview with Piers Morgan where he faced an "onslaught of questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:04">[02:06:04]</a>.

Despite being banned, Akademiks acknowledges Tate's intelligence in continuing to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:54">[02:13:54]</a>. He points out that Tate has embraced a "decentralized platform" strategy by appearing in interviews with many other influencers, effectively reaching his audience even without his own channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:06">[02:14:06]</a>.

## Manosphere and "Red Pill" Ideology
Akademiks discusses the "manosphere," "red pill," and "alpha male" ideologies, acknowledging that while he doesn't subscribe to them, some of their points align with his own thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:42">[01:50:42]</a>. He mentions figures like Kevin Samuels, who aimed to make people more realistic about expectations in relationships, especially regarding women seeking millionaires due to social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>.

However, Akademiks advises his audience to be realistic, as the "high value man" concept applies to only 1% of men, making it an unrealistic goal for most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:52">[02:03:52]</a>. He criticizes the idea that treating women poorly makes a man an "alpha," considering it insecure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:21">[02:39:21]</a>.

## Tate's Conversion to Islam
Akademiks notes that [[andrew_tates_social_media_strategy_and_mlm_scheme | Andrew Tate's]] conversion to Islam is a "smart move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:03">[02:11:03]</a>. He explains that many of Tate's ideals and philosophies align with more traditional, less tolerant aspects of Islam, making it difficult for "liberals" to criticize without appearing to attack an entire religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:05">[02:12:05]</a>. Tate himself stated he chose Islam because it is the "last religion that exists," contrasting it with Christianity's perceived "tolerance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:34">[02:12:34]</a>.

Despite being the "most searched person on the internet" at one point, Tate's conversion to Islam didn't receive widespread news coverage because his platforms were stripped away, limiting his ability to control the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:34">[02:13:34]</a>.

## Perspective on "Cancel Culture" and Comedy
Akademiks acknowledges that "cancel culture" benefits content creators like those on "Fresh and Fit," as people who get canceled often appear on their platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. He differentiates between intentional comedy and perceived offense. He states that artists and musicians have the "privilege" to address radioactive topics through art or comedy in a way that allows people to digest them without being canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:59">[02:07:59]</a>. He argues that if content is framed as comedy, people will be more accepting, even of controversial jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:11">[02:08:11]</a>.

He highlights that he doesn't get the "luxury" of being perceived as joking when he makes controversial statements, unlike comedians who can use humor as a defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:54">[02:18:54]</a>. He believes that sometimes the mainstream narrative is correct, and people should not reject it purely out of distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>.

## Interactions with [[hasan_piker_and_andrew_tate_debate | Hasan Piker]]
Akademiks references [[hasan_piker_and_andrew_tate_debate | Hasan Piker]] as someone who has taken a political side, leading to both immense support and vitriol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:19">[02:30:19]</a>. He praises Hasan's ability to "bust balls" and make jokes, affirming that Hasan defends the right to joke without being canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:32">[02:30:32]</a>. Akademiks emphasizes that avoiding a definitive political stance allows for the "glorious luxury" of being a human being, sometimes leaning right, sometimes left, and expressing these through comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:01">[02:31:01]</a>.

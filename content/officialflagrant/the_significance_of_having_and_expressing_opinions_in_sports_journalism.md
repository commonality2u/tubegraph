Sports journalism, like any field, has evolved significantly. While today's landscape allows nearly anyone to express an opinion, there was a time when the right to voice an opinion had to be meticulously earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Earning the Right to an Opinion
In earlier eras of journalism, especially in the newspaper industry, expressing an opinion was a privilege reserved for columnists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the modern age of social media, where "everybody can have an opinion" without necessarily having worked through the rigorous journalistic hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

[[Stephen A Smith and his sports journalism career | Stephen A. Smith]] recalls working through nearly 10 promotions in his career before being granted a columnist position by the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. He was the 21st Black person in American history to be given that title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This long journey underscores the importance of respecting those who "came before you to pave the way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

When granted the columnist role, [[Stephen A Smith and his sports journalism career | Smith]] felt a sense of freedom, being able to express his true feelings beyond just reporting facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. He always had opinions, even when he was just a reporter, finding ways to "sting" a little by inserting subtle critiques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Once unleashed, he was "spitting out opinions left and right," covering various athletes like Allen Iverson, Larry Brown, and Tracy McGrady <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## The Dynamics of Trust and Confidentiality
A crucial aspect of sports journalism, especially when expressing strong opinions, is maintaining [[The dynamics of trust and confidentiality in sports journalism | trust and confidentiality]] with sources and athletes. [[Stephen A Smith and his sports journalism career | Smith]] states that journalists "all know 75% more than what we reveal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. He personally doesn't reveal "80% of the stuff that I know" to build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. If everything were disclosed, no one would trust a journalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

[[Stephen A Smith and his sports journalism career | Smith]] adheres to a "code" (or "bro code") that transcends race and applies universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This code dictates that personal lives are off-limits unless they directly impact performance on the field or court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. For example, if a player is visibly impaired due to substance use during a game and it affects their play, [[Stephen A Smith and his sports journalism career | Smith]] might critique their performance in a way that hints at the underlying issue without explicitly stating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. He will not report on private affairs or drug use unless it's a direct, unignorable detriment to their professional performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

He acknowledges that GMs or coaches might leak information about opposing teams, hoping he'll publish it to instigate wars between teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. His primary concern, however, is the veracity of the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. If it's truthful, he will use it, but he draws a clear line at gossip or personal attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

## Relationships with Athletes
[[Stephen A Smith and his sports journalism career | Smith]]'s opinions are "fact-based" due to his nearly 30 years of covering the NBA and his extensive network of contacts, including coaches, players, owners, and player personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. He would directly confront players, even telling them face-to-face if their performance was "garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

He famously had an eight-month period where he didn't speak to Allen Iverson because Iverson disliked an article [[Stephen A Smith and his sports journalism career | Smith]] wrote, which criticized Iverson for taking too many liberties and needing to "get his act together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The rift stemmed from Iverson's frustration after a friend was murdered, which led to his famous "practice" rant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Their reconciliation was facilitated by Iverson's late friend, Rob, who arranged a meeting at a nightclub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Another notable confrontation involved Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson. In 2003-2004, after Randy Ayers took over coaching the 76ers and was ultimately fired, [[Stephen A Smith and his sports journalism career | Smith]] went on TV to express his views on Robinson's handling of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. This led to a heated exchange in the locker room in Denver, where [[Stephen A Smith and his sports journalism career | Smith]] responded to Robinson's insults by saying he felt the "exact same way" about Robinson's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Years later, [[Stephen A Smith and his sports journalism career | Smith]] regretted his behavior, recognizing that as the journalist, he should have been the professional and the "grown-up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. He later apologized to Robinson's son, ensuring their father's past issues would not influence his commentary on the son's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

## [[The Role of Social Issues and Politics in Sports | Social Issues and Sports Opinions]]
[[Stephen A Smith and his sports journalism career | Stephen A. Smith]] believes [[The role of social issues and politics in sports | sports are an escape]] from a "messed up world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. He acknowledges that people get frustrated when politics and social issues "infiltrate" sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. However, he argues that "society has always infiltrated sports" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>, citing historical figures like Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Curt Flood, and Jackie Robinson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. These athletes used their platforms to address real-world issues, demonstrating that they "still have to live in the society once the game stops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>.

[[Stephen A Smith and his sports journalism career | Smith]] defends athletes like Colin Kaepernick, who protested without disrupting the game itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>. He concludes that it is beneficial when societal issues infiltrate sports because it reminds everyone that while "life can be beautiful and it can be a game," it's ultimately "about life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>.

Napoleon Bonaparte, a prominent French General, is regarded by some as the "greatest of all time" among military leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:11:00">[53:11:00]</a>. His approach to warfare and his views on history have left a significant mark.

## Concept of "Total War"
Napoleon is credited with inventing the concept of "Total War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:07:00">[54:07:00]</a>. This involved using the entire country's resources for the war effort, including industry shifting to wartime production (e.g., car makers producing tanks and bullets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:15:00">[54:15:00]</a>. This contrasted with earlier, more "gentlemanly" forms of warfare where surrenders involved formal meetings and sword exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:26:00">[54:26:00]</a>. Napoleon's philosophy was to fight ruthlessly, advocating for killing everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:38:00">[54:38:00]</a>.

It is suggested that the application of total war tactics by Napoleon led to a significant increase in war casualties compared to previous eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:41:00">[54:41:00]</a>.

## Views on History
A notable quote attributed to Napoleon states, "History is a set of lies agreed upon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. This perspective suggests a skepticism towards historical narratives, particularly regarding ancient history, where details might be "made up" or romanticized by omitting "boring stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.

## [[the_portrayal_of_historical_figures_and_events_in_media_such_as_napoleon | Portrayal in Media]]
The film *Napoleon* by Ridley Scott is mentioned, with a preference for its 4.5-hour director's cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:20:00">[53:20:00]</a>. This suggests public interest in [[the_portrayal_of_historical_figures_and_events_in_media_such_as_napoleon | Napoleon's story]] and its cinematic interpretations.

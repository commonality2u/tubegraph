Sobriety, while a journey of profound personal growth, presents unique challenges and often becomes a source for humor among comedians. The path to [[Addiction and Recovery | recovery]] involves confronting past behaviors and navigating social dynamics, sometimes finding levity in the struggles and support systems.

## The Path to Sobriety

Comedian Bobby Lee has been open about his journey to sobriety, mentioning being "seven months sober" at the time of this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. He even jokes about not remembering the exact date of his sobriety, contrasting it with the common experience of those in recovery who often "remember the date" of their first rehab or sobriety milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. His friend Andrew Santino humorously points out that Bobby only knows his sobriety length because Andrew told him it was seven months, highlighting a dynamic of support and lighthearted teasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Navigating Social Situations

A significant challenge in sobriety, especially for a comedian on tour, is navigating social situations where alcohol is present. Bobby recounts an incident in Mexico where others were telling people not to give him alcohol due to his "disease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:44">[01:48:44]</a>. Andrew actively prevented Bobby from drinking at an open bar, giving him a "weird sprite thing that had no liquor in it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:52">[01:38:52]</a>. Bobby expresses his frustration at the time, stating, "I'm already in the disease so I'm gonna get it anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:08">[01:47:08]</a>, even getting angry at Andrew for not supporting his desire for alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:35">[01:58:35]</a>. Andrew's firm stance was "not gonna support it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>, showcasing a true friend's commitment to Bobby's well-being.

Despite Andrew's efforts, Bobby admits to relapsing in Mexico, getting drunk on his own in the hotel room and creating a chaotic scene involving vomit and even fecal matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:30">[02:09:30]</a>. This low point, where Bobby felt "things just slipping away," ultimately led to him getting "real serious" about his sobriety and deciding he "can't continue" because he didn't "want to lose everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:47">[02:12:47]</a>.

## Humor as a Defense Mechanism and Tool

For Bobby, humor has become a significant coping mechanism and a foundation for his career. His therapist suggested that his "weird sense of humor" developed as a "defense mechanism" due to "so much trauma in [his] life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>. He has successfully channeled this into a career, noting that if stand-up comedy wasn't available, he might not have thrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:59">[02:02:59]</a>.

His friends also use humor to address his sobriety, often poking fun at him but with an underlying tone of support. Andrew playfully notes that Bobby is "almost as funny when you're sober" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>. This use of humor in addressing serious topics aligns with [[The role of humor and storytelling in truthtelling | the role of humor and storytelling in truthtelling]], allowing difficult subjects to be discussed in a relatable and engaging way.

## Personal Growth and Connection

Bobby emphasizes that his recent sobriety at age 50 has led to a new chapter of "joy and fun and responsibility and connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. He's making an effort to meet with people, going to lunches and dinners, something he previously avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:44">[02:28:44]</a>. This newfound responsibility and connection highlight the transformative power of sobriety, even if it comes with playful jabs from his friends about his age and past behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>.

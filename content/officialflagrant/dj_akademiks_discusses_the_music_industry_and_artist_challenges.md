[[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | DJ Akademiks]], making his second appearance on the *Flagrant* podcast, delved into various aspects of the [[music_industry_insights | music industry]] and the challenges faced by artists, including the impact of cancel culture, evolving business models, and legal issues affecting rappers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Impact of Cancel Culture and Media Influence
[[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Akademiks]] noted that [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | nobody benefited more than the Fresh & Fit podcast from cancel culture]], suggesting that more people get "cancelled," the more they appear on such platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. He also discussed how his own experience with attempted "cancellation" made him realize what "real cancellation" was for others, acknowledging that he can still use his bank account and is on social media, even if [[independent_artist_challenges_and_music_industry_dynamics | shadowbanned]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

He highlights the power of media, stating that an artist should "never beef with the media" because the media will win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Akademiks]] explains that his portion of the media operates on respect and ego; if disrespected, he ensures he doesn't give the benefit of the doubt and takes things personally, potentially impacting careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. He states that he is very cognizant of his impact on artists' careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>.

## Artist Feuds and Critiques

### Lil Baby
[[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Akademiks]] addressed his ongoing "beef" with [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Lil Baby]], stating that [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Lil Baby]] "dissed" him twice on his album "unprovokingly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. He believes [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Lil Baby]] is "scared of what [Kanye] got going on" and is trying to create a "smoke screen" by targeting [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Akademiks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Akademiks]] clarified that he cannot technically be a "snitch" because he does not engage in "street sh**" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. He maintains that [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Lil Baby's]] latest album was "mid" (mediocre), lacking "one bonafide hit" despite [[music_industry_insights | 18 months of hits leading up to it]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:06">[02:11:06]</a>.

### Kanye West
[[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Akademiks]] believes [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Kanye West]] is currently dealing with mental illness and is "using the black community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. He sees [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Kanye's]] ultimate goal as creating a cult and having "complete control" rather than being solely about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. He mentions that [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Kanye]] was once the "most searched figure" on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:21">[02:13:21]</a>.

### 6ix9ine
[[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Akademiks]] discusses [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | 6ix9ine's]] career shift, noting that he seems to have "given up on rap" and is now more involved with YouTubers like SteveWillDoIt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:22">[01:37:22]</a>. He argues that [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | 6ix9ine]] "can't be 6ix9ine off YouTube; you have to be 6ix9ine in music and culture" to maintain his level of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:59">[01:39:59]</a>. He states that [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | 6ix9ine's]] music career is effectively "done" because his label has "blackballed" him from playlists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:06">[01:41:06]</a>.

## Legal Challenges and the Atlanta Scene
A significant portion of the [[discussion_on_hiphop_culture_and_industry_dynamics | discussion focused on the legal troubles of Atlanta rappers]], particularly [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Young Thug]] and [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Gunna]], who are facing RICO charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Akademiks]] explained that the District Attorney in Atlanta, a Black woman, is cracking down on rappers because they believe artists are funding crime and contributing to rising crime rates by bragging about illegal activities in their lyrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:21">[02:25:21]</a>. He notes that the DA's actions are popular among Atlanta residents frustrated with crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:06">[02:12:06]</a>.

## Evolution of the Music Industry
[[evolving_music_genres_and_market_trends | Akademiks]] drew a contrast between the music industry's response to piracy and the movie industry's. He said the movie industry "enriched the experience of going" to the cinema to combat illegal downloading, while the music industry "copped" by shifting to streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:56">[03:12:56]</a>. He argues that relying solely on streaming dilutes value, as money is distributed among "hundreds of thousands of artists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:31">[03:13:31]</a>.

He highlighted [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Taylor Swift]] as a visionary in the [[music_industry_insights | music industry]], praising her strategy of re-recording songs to own her masters and creating collectible physical albums (CDs, vinyls, cassettes) with exclusive content to incentivize sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:51">[03:11:51]</a>. [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Swift's]] approach leverages the "experience" rather than just the music, conditioning fans to buy. He contrasts this with [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Drake]], whose albums, if leaked, would be significantly affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:39">[03:15:39]</a>.

## Financial Dynamics in Hip-Hop
[[independent_artist_challenges_and_music_industry_dynamics | Akademiks]] expressed frustration with older rappers who complain about their deals but don't share information with newer artists about negotiating better terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:30">[03:07:30]</a>. He likened the rap game's signing deals to a "Ponzi scheme," where artists are encouraged to sign others to their own labels to make money, rather than focusing on the money owed from their own deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:28">[03:09:28]</a>. He advises that if someone wants "the money," they should aspire to be an executive like Scooter Braun, who bought [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Taylor Swift's]] masters and managed [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Justin Bieber]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:14">[03:11:14]</a>.

[[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Akademiks]] noted that [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Meek Mill's]] career is past its peak, and he is now trying to pivot to being a label owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:25">[03:25:25]</a>. He warns that if artists wait too long to focus on their labels for income, they waste their "best years" without fully benefiting from their labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:25">[03:25:25]</a>.

## Personal Brand and Safety
[[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | Akademiks]] emphasized the importance of professional security over "homie security" for public figures, citing instances where untrained friends might be a liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:03">[03:34:03]</a>. He now prefers to hire armed police for security, especially when traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:50">[03:46:50]</a>. He also uses fake names when checking into hotels and tries to travel less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:26">[03:51:26]</a>. He stated that he finds joy in his work and doesn't plan to "tap out" of the game even if he achieved a net worth of $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:50">[03:50:50]</a>. He says he intentionally dresses casually while wearing expensive jewelry to maintain a relatable yet successful image, especially for his target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:50">[04:42:50]</a>.

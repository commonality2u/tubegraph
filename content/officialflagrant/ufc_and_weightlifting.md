Weightlifting and physical conditioning are crucial aspects of a fighter's career, with various approaches and physical outcomes discussed, particularly in the context of the [[ufc_and_mma_culture | UFC]].

## Fighter Physiques and Training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>
Some individuals naturally build muscle in certain areas more easily than others. For example, Al, despite not lifting weights, has very muscular arms, while his legs "will not grow at all" even with consistent squats and deadlifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

A notable example of a unique physique in combat sports is [[jon_jones_and_the_dynamics_of_heel_vs_face_in_combat_sports | Jon Jones]], who despite working out "hard" with powerlifting, deadlifting, and squats, has "tiny calves" that are "almost non-existent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. His physique is described as having "the perfect frame for fighting" because he only possesses muscle "where he needs it," such as shoulders, arms, and thighs, with his long reach also being a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

## Steroid Testing in Combat Sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:11">[02:21:11]</a>
The effectiveness of steroid testing in combat sports organizations, including the [[ufc_and_mma_culture | UFC]], varies by commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:18">[02:21:18]</a>. Nevada's athletic commission is considered "very strict" and "the best" at conducting tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>. Historically, fighters like Alistair Overeem and Brock Lesnar, known for their immense physiques, competed in eras where testing was either nonexistent or "very lightly" enforced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:54">[02:21:54]</a>.

## Weightlifting for Anti-Aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:02">[02:17:02]</a>
Weightlifting is emphasized as a primary method to "stop aging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:02">[02:17:02]</a>. It is recommended to lift heavy things to maintain muscle tissue and prevent the normal deterioration associated with aging, such as difficulty with stairs or opening jars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:08">[02:17:08]</a>. This can include bodyweight exercises like chin-ups, push-ups, and squats, as the body itself provides sufficient resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:44">[02:17:44]</a>. The goal is to make the body accustomed to lifting to preserve function and stave off typical aging processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:04">[02:18:04]</a>.

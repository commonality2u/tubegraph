LeBron James and JJ Redick have collaborated on a new podcast, "Mind the Game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>. The podcast aims to offer in-depth, nuanced basketball analysis, targeting both casual and hardcore fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:14">[01:31:14]</a>.

## Origin of the Collaboration
JJ Redick has known LeBron James for approximately 24 to 25 years, having first met when they were around 15 or 16 at a USA Basketball Camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:52">[02:10:52]</a>. While they have always shared a mutual respect, they are not close personal friends who would socialize off the court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>. The idea for the podcast came to fruition after Redick and James met in December with their respective teams, where a conversation "got the ball rolling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Podcast Content and Style
"Mind the Game" is designed to be a basketball enthusiast's dream, featuring "two basketball nerds geeking out over basketball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:24">[01:31:24]</a>. It distinguishes itself by not "watering down the game" for a broader audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:17">[01:31:17]</a>. The podcast incorporates graphics and detailed explanations of plays, which were particularly helpful in the first episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. According to Redick, the on-screen graphics help viewers "understand what you guys are talking about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:04">[02:13:04]</a>.

The hosts discuss specific plays and technical aspects of the game, referencing plays from LeBron's career, with both individuals knowing the exact plays being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:57">[02:13:57]</a>. This approach results in "way less fluff" compared to typical sports commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:05">[02:14:05]</a>.

## Impact and Reception
JJ Redick stated that he immediately recognized the podcast would be a hit, even within the first 15 to 20 minutes of recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:06">[02:12:06]</a>. He believes the podcast is "truly changing the way basketball is analyzed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>. The show sets a new precedent for sports analysis by featuring players who have competed at a high level and can communicate their opinions unapologetically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:42">[01:38:42]</a>. This approach fills a "void" in sports media, providing content for those who seek in-depth analysis rather than just "hot takes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:16">[01:40:16]</a>.

The co-host expressed that the podcast raises the "level of intellect of the audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:09">[02:13:09]</a>. He also noted that [[Lebron James vs Michael Jordan debate | LeBron James]] is "awesome" in this podcast setting, as it offers a different perspective from his usual press conference appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:30">[02:13:30]</a>.

## Future of the Podcast
"Mind the Game" plans to continue releasing episodes, with the initial recordings including multiple parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>. The creators recommend watching the YouTube video versions to fully grasp the visual explanations and graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:57">[02:12:57]</a>.

[[logan_pauls_boxing_career | Logan Paul]] has openly discussed his unreciprocated payment from his exhibition boxing match against Floyd Mayweather, alongside other aspects of the controversial event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Unpaid Fight Earnings
[[logan_pauls_boxing_career | Logan Paul]] asserts that Floyd Mayweather never paid him for their exhibition boxing match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. He states Mayweather owes him "millions," estimating the amount to be over $2 million and likely just under $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Paul claims Mayweather knows how to conveniently allocate money to appear as an expense and engages in "under the table" or cash deals, using Paul's name and likeness without consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Mayweather is reportedly being sued in New York for allegedly taking $10 million cash from ticketing or rights, without providing Paul his percentage cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Paul indicates his lawsuit would be the second for the same event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. He speculates that Mayweather might be "on his way" to being broke if he doesn't continue exhibition fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Fight Performance and Aftermath
The fight was seen as something that "never should have happened," yet [[logan_pauls_boxing_career | Logan Paul]] lasted eight rounds against Mayweather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Paul claims he "pieced him up a little bit" and landed an overhand right that hurt Mayweather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. He also states he popped Mayweather's eardrum during the fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

### Perceived Victory and Rounds Won
Despite the lack of an official decision in the exhibition, [[logan_pauls_boxing_career | Logan Paul]] and his brother, [[public_perception_and_controversies_surrounding_jake_paul | Jake Paul]], debated how many rounds Logan won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. [[public_perception_and_controversies_surrounding_jake_paul | Jake Paul]] immediately after the fight declared Logan won "eight rounds to nothing," suggesting Logan beat "the greatest fight of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. Logan himself believes he won at least three rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, although others in the discussion argued he won only one or even zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

### Mayweather's Fighting Style
[[logan_pauls_boxing_career | Logan Paul]] was most surprised by how slow Mayweather was during the fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. He noted that Mayweather's punches did not hit hard, and once he observed Mayweather's speed in the first round, he knew he wouldn't be knocked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Mayweather, known for his defensive style, is not primarily recognized for hitting hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Paul also mentions that Mayweather was surprised by his reach, commenting in his corner that it was hard to hit Paul with a jab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Mistaken Identity
One theory for why the fight happened is that Mayweather might have confused [[logan_pauls_boxing_career | Logan Paul]] with his brother, [[public_perception_and_controversies_surrounding_jake_paul | Jake Paul]], who had previously beaten Nate Robinson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. The idea suggests Mayweather sought retribution against the "older brother" after [[public_perception_and_controversies_surrounding_jake_paul | Jake Paul]]'s victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

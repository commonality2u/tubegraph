## Desiring a Female President
Cummings states that she would "love a female president" and believes it would be "fire" and "great for our country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. She clarifies that when she says "female," she doesn't "divide them up" and considers "female is female," even noting that a "trans female" president would be "fire" and "very progressive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>. She emphasizes that "the future is female" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

## Comedic Perspective on a Female President's Conduct
Cummings reveals she was working on a comedy bit about a female president, specifically focusing on not wanting the leader to be seen "sucking dicks" while in office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>. Her concern is that international leaders might "look down upon that" and perceive the U.S. as weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>. She suggests that during the four years of a presidency, such activities could be "outsourced" to a husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>.

She also jokes that a female president "should never be in a subservient position" but then contradicts herself by saying she "should though, that's fine, everybody's happier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. A "lesbian president" would be "perfect" because "everyone would know" she isn't in such a position with a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

Cummings adds further comedic points, such as a female president not having "balls on her chin" for four years, or not having her period during her term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

## Concerns about Female Leaders
Cummings expresses a desire for the "perfect" female president, fearing that a "bad one would be the worst thing ever because no one would ever want one ever again and like it would be such a setback" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>.

She also brings up the topic of [[challenges_in_comedy_for_women|women in comedy]] and their portrayal. Comparing female comedians to male comedians, she notes that men often use podcasts to discuss "their depression and like their anxiety attacks," while women like her still need to prove they are funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:17">[01:43:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:47">[01:43:47]</a>. Cummings humorously calls it "sexism" that men "bragging about being weak" makes her "sick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:33">[01:44:33]</a>. She claims her specials are "all about how men and women are different" and that "sexism bought me a mansion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:57">[01:44:57]</a>.

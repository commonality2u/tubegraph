## Tapping into Primal Self and Cultural Roots
A fighter describes visualizing his wins, knockouts, and post-fight press conferences, feeling immense happiness during these visualizations. This mental practice helps him manifest success, acting as a "vessel" in a "flow state" where things just happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He uses his imagination as a tool for manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Six weeks prior to a fight, he engaged in practices to connect with his primal self, including taking mushroom chocolates and meditating in the shower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This microdosing helped him "tap into himself" and connect with his "dog in me" to reinforce his self-belief in victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:51">[02:11:51]</a>. He emphasizes that the goal is not merely to win, but to prove to himself that he can overcome his opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:34">[02:13:34]</a>.

Leading up to a fight against an opponent deeply connected to his own culture, the fighter felt the need to tap into his own cultural roots and spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>. He specifically brought a *Ukha*, a chief staff made from a horse's tail, to a weigh-in as a symbol of his royal family heritage (his prefix "Adesanya" means "king") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:12">[03:09:12]</a>. He believes that understanding and connecting with African history, which highlights rulers and the wealthiest men in history, empowers him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:06">[03:10:06]</a>. This practice is seen as a way of connecting to his "Primal self" and will be continued in future endeavors due to its perceived success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:51">[03:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:56">[03:11:56]</a>.

## The Flow State and its Spiritual Dimension
The fighter views the "flow state" (being "in the zone") as a spiritual experience, equating science with spirituality or magic yet to be understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:24">[03:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:32">[03:12:32]</a>. He notes that during this state, specific chemicals are released in the brain, creating a heightened sense of awareness and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:40">[03:12:40]</a>.

He recounts a specific instance during a fight on "Fight Island" where he took a nap on a chair while getting his hands wrapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:15">[03:19:15]</a>. During this nap, he experienced something akin to a "Lion King" or "Black Panther" scene, where he was told to "remember who you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:36">[03:20:36]</a>. Waking up, he felt like a "sleeper agent" activated into a different zone, which profoundly impacted his performance in the subsequent fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:47">[03:20:47]</a>. This experience, combined with the belief of those he cares about, solidifies his own self-belief, allowing him to perform at his best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>.

This perspective highlights the deep connection between [[role_of_mentality_and_meditation_in_sports | mental and meditative practices]], cultural identity, and peak athletic performance, suggesting a spiritual dimension to achieving success in sports.

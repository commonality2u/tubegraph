[[logan_pauls_thoughts_on_influential_figures_in_entertainment | Logan Paul]] identifies himself as "the real Maverick," "the crown prick of Pokemon," and "the most hated man in wrestling," acknowledging the public personas he has cultivated and the strong reactions he elicits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Shift Towards Authenticity
Paul believes that politics, and entertainment as a whole, are approaching an era where authenticity will "reign supreme" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>. He states that he is 100% himself, and this transparency is a "blessing" because whether people like or dislike him, it's based on his true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. He contrasts this with 95% of celebrities who "fake every single thing," leading the public to like a character or music, but not knowing who the person truly is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

Having met many famous individuals, Paul notes that while some, like Drake, are "incredible human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>, others maintain a "facade" and are not enjoyable to be around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>. He suggests that those who have "been in the grind" often show respect to others in similar fields, understanding the effort involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>.

## The Evolving Value of Influencers
Paul discusses the changing perception of online content creators. He notes that early on, being a YouTuber wasn't as respected as being an actor or singer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. However, the "playing field is kind of level" now, with digital entrepreneurs gaining increasing recognition and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>. He predicts a "complete shift" in how the public perceives fame once influencers are involved in multi-billion dollar companies and earn more than traditional actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.

He recounts a time when he had to "beg big Brands to pay" him a few thousand dollars because they didn't understand the power of digital reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. Now, brands are eager to connect with younger audiences, a key demographic that influencers can reach directly and rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.

## Work Ethic vs. Talent
Reflecting on his own success, Paul humbly states that his "work ethic makes up for [his] lack of talent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. He clarifies that he is not an "incredible singer" or "incredible actor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>, but he works very hard and is "smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. He suggests that he and his brother, [[controversial_moments_and_public_persona_of_jake_paul | Jake Paul]], play off being "stupid" for public consumption, which allows them to "over-deliver" and ensures people underestimate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Humility
Paul states that he has been "humbled multiple times," especially in his boxing career where he has a one-and-one record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:10">[01:38:10]</a>. He attributes his current "grounded" state partially to his "big cancellation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>, which forced him to confront his actions and avoid the pitfall of feeling "justified in their success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>. He believes that more good celebrities exist than bad ones, estimating an "80/20" split where most top-tier individuals he meets are "awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

Paul acknowledges that certain traits or childhood traumas can lead individuals to "crave validity from strangers," which, when combined with fame, can "inflate" their ego and make them believe they are the person they wish they were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.

## Drive and Purpose
Despite feeling "numb to success and failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>, Paul is driven by his love for what he does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:17">[01:59:17]</a>. He emphasizes that being numb doesn't mean he doesn't care, but rather that he is not "affected by the highs or the lows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:22">[01:59:22]</a>. He cares about outcomes but learns from "shortcomings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:45">[01:59:45]</a>, using them as stepping stones for future endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a>.

His ultimate goal is to be the "biggest entertainer in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:05">[01:55:05]</a>. At 26, when he fought [[logan_pauls_allegations_against_floyd_mayweather | Floyd Mayweather]], he realized he had achieved that goal, recognizing it as the "most entertaining thing happening" globally at that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:40">[01:55:40]</a>. This led to a "what now moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:25">[01:58:25]</a>, prompting him to reflect on his future pursuits.

Paul continues to create constantly, "recording snapping videos and pictures," even if he doesn't always release them publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:37">[01:56:37]</a>. His criteria for releasing content are based on his "taste" and whether it will entertain, add value, or provide distraction for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:05">[01:55:05]</a>. He aims to make people "feel good or bad," as indifference is the worst reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:30">[01:50:30]</a>.

## Impact of Social Media
Social media's ability to connect people and amplify sentiments means that even vocal minorities can make things trend, sometimes leading to movements with merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:29">[03:05:29]</a>. This connectivity also means that "alienated people" who previously lacked a voice can now find community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:48">[03:05:48]</a>, as exemplified by the existence of the Flat Earth community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:16">[03:06:16]</a>. Paul states, "if you don't have Community now that's tough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:56">[03:05:56]</a>.

However, this has also led to a "fractured" media landscape, where individuals can find highly specific content that satisfies their every need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>. This raises questions about who will be the unifying figures that bring people together, like a "Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson type" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:11">[03:03:11]</a>, in a world where mass appeal is becoming rarer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>.

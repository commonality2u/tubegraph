The world of [[comedy_and_standup | standup comedy]] and comedians has recently faced scrutiny, particularly in the wake of the incident involving Will Smith and Chris Rock at the Oscars. This event has highlighted broader concerns about the safety and respect afforded to performers, the role of humor in public discourse, and the evolving [[controversies_and_dynamics_in_standup_comedy | dynamics within the industry]].

## Comedians as "Under Attack"

Following the on-stage slap of Chris Rock by Will Smith, some comedians expressed a sentiment that they are now "under attack" and need to be prepared for physical altercations during performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This perspective suggests that performers might need to "dress prepared for violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. One comedian even likened this situation to "the Ukrainians of America," emphasizing a perceived state of vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Comedian Experiences with Violence
The idea of comedians facing physical [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_standup_comedy | challenges]] is not unprecedented. One comedian recounted being punched on stage during his first show in Harlem, while making fun of an audience member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:28">[01:27:28]</a>. He noted that there was no stage, putting him directly in front of the audience, and he was fortunate that security intervened before he could react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>. This experience led him to empathize with Chris Rock's shock in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:56">[01:41:56]</a>.

## The Will Smith and Chris Rock Incident

The incident at the Oscars occurred after Chris Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, referencing "G.I. Jane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Jada Pinkett Smith has publicly shared that she suffers from alopecia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>.

Initially, many, including some viewing the broadcast, thought the slap was fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:37">[01:42:37]</a>. However, Chris Rock's shift in energy indicated it was real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. Will Smith proceeded to win Best Actor that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>, and was allowed to remain at the event despite the assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:34">[03:34:34]</a>.

### Chris Rock's Reaction and Career
Chris Rock did not retaliate physically, a decision some attribute to his professionalism and concern for his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. It is suggested that acting professionally in that moment would be seen favorably by Hollywood executives, while a physical reaction might lead to him being perceived as having "issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">[01:47:48]</a>. This contrasts with figures like Antonio Brown or Floyd Mayweather, who are perceived as "free" to act as they wish because they are not "beholden" to organizations like the NFL or sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:20">[09:40:20]</a>.

> [!info] "Ego Death" Tour
> Chris Rock's new tour is titled "Ego Death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. Some argue that being slapped and not retaliating goes against the idea of having an ego, particularly if he cannot even make jokes about Will Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. However, others contend that he *can* make jokes about Will Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:26">[01:23:26]</a>.

### The Audience and Hollywood's Stance
A notable aspect of the incident is the reaction of the Hollywood audience. It was argued that "nobody in that room was rooting for Chris Rock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:57">[01:55:57]</a> because many had been the target of his jokes over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:01">[01:59:01]</a>. Hollywood figures, described as living in "Hollywood bubbles" and lacking a sense of humor, reportedly "loved the fact that Will got up and slapped the bully" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. Figures like Samuel L. Jackson and Denzel Washington were seen dapping up or comforting Will Smith after the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:50">[03:19:50]</a>.

### Justification and Hypocrisy
Will Smith, in his acceptance speech, justified his actions by stating that "Richard Williams was a fierce protector of his family" and that "sometimes loves you do crazy things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:12">[04:12:12]</a>. This comparison drew criticism, with one pundit stating, "You are not Richard Williams... you're a fucking genius who got 800 on his SATs and then you made brilliant career moves and now you're emotionally abused and you can't see that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:26">[04:26:26]</a>.

There's a strong sentiment that Will Smith's actions were driven by personal insecurity and a perceived loss of fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:42">[04:41:42]</a>. It's argued that he chose to "pick on somebody he knew he could get away with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:47">[04:45:47]</a>, rather than confront someone physically imposing like "the Rock" or Joe Rogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:10">[05:10:10]</a>.

The incident is further critiqued as hypocritical given that Will Smith previously produced a show about [[standup_comedy_and_its_cultural_impact | standup comedy]], yet seemingly dictated what comedians "can and can't say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:04">[04:57:04]</a>.

## The Role of Jokes and Transparency

The debate also extends to the nature of jokes and the expectation of public figures to be transparent. Jada Pinkett Smith had previously posted a video where she stated, "all I can do at this point is laugh about it" regarding her alopecia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:34">[03:34:34]</a>. This led to the argument that if a public figure *monetizes* their experience and states they can "laugh about it," a comedian is justified in making a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>.

> [!note] Jokes about Disorders
> While some argue that making fun of a medical disorder like alopecia is "fucked up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, others contend that a comedian's job is to make jokes, and that public figures, by putting their lives out there, become subject to commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>. It was suggested that Chris Rock might not have known about Jada's disorder, or that the joke writer simply observed her shaved head and made a visual comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### Celebrity Transparency and its Fallout
The Smith family had attempted to cultivate an image of transparency, similar to the Kardashians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. However, it is argued that while the Kardashians "love the smoke" and thrive on public attention, the Smiths could not handle the "real" information that came out, such as Jada's "entanglement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Jada's "Red Table Talk" platform, meant for transparency, has been criticized for sharing partial truths or "balls face lies" about her marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

The hosts note that this level of transparency, coupled with an inability to handle public scrutiny or jokes, created a situation where Will Smith became "the butt of the joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## The Aftermath and [[Social dynamics among comedians | Comedian's Rights]]
Despite the widespread discussion, Chris Rock chose not to press charges against Will Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. The incident sparked a conversation about the rights of comedians and audience members:

> [!quote] On Reactions to Jokes
> "Everybody's allowed to react whatever way they want to a joke... That's fine. Like you can be angry, you can cuss somebody out of a comedy show, completely fine... It's when you start interrupting or when you put your life on someone else it's super entitled, it's super privileged." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>

The hosts argue that Will Smith's action was an "entitled" and "privileged" act that interrupted the show and made it about himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. There was a consensus that while one can be upset by a joke, physical assault is never justified, and issues should be handled privately, such as backstage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. The lack of immediate support for Chris Rock from other celebrities was also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

That Mexican OT's music and persona are deeply rooted in the culture and lifestyle of Texas, particularly the country and coastal regions. From his affinity for firearms to his embrace of the cowboy way of life, his upbringing in Texas has shaped both his personal outlook and his artistic expression.

## A Texan's Mentality: Guns and Self-Sufficiency

That Mexican OT often highlights the prevalence of guns in Texas and his personal reliance on them for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:26">[02:15:26]</a>. He describes driving with two ARs in the car – one in the passenger seat and one in the back – plus a pistol on his left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. For him, a gun is more essential than his wallet or cellphone, forming a "wallet, cellphone, gun" checklist before leaving home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. He even carries a gun to church, likening it to a common Texan practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

This perspective stems from a perceived need for self-defense in Texas, where he states the "shit ain't out here friendly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. He contrasts this with New York, where he feels safer, and California, where he feels "everybody's out to get me" and overthinks too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. He views guns as providing a sense of "superhero" security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. He has had to pull out his AR-15 during "land parties" to deal with people under the influence of drugs who were "thinking they Superman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

## Rural Texas Living and Pastimes

That Mexican OT's description of his life outside of music paints a picture of rural Texas:
*   **Land Parties**: He and his kinfolk frequently host parties on their acres of land, featuring cars, four-wheelers, music, and smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   **Hog Hunting**: A common pastime in Texas, hog hunting is described as a necessity due to pigs being a nuisance that destroy land and crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>. He participates by riding in the back of a truck, or even a helicopter, to hunt them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>. The meat is sometimes cooked, or the carcasses are left for other animals as part of the "cycle of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.
*   **Alligators**: He mentions the prevalence of alligators in Texas rivers and even on golf courses in Bay City, explaining that Texas rivers flow into the Gulf, leading to gator infestations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>.

## The Cowboy Persona and Its Roots

His public image has undergone a [[transition_from_rapping_to_embracing_a_cowboy_persona | significant shift]] from a typical "rapper" look to a distinct cowboy persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>. This embrace was not initially conscious but emerged from a desire to "just wear what I will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:32">[01:34:32]</a>. He now views his cowboy hat and boots as his "chain," symbolizing his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>.

The concept of a "cowboy" in Texas goes beyond just riding horses; it encompasses a lifestyle and mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:04">[01:54:04]</a>. It involves owning cattle, managing land, trimming cattle's nails, and repairing fences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:38">[01:53:38]</a>. His great-uncle, Chico, was recognized as the "Black Cowboy of the Century" in Southern Texas, known for his ability to break horses and maintain his farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:21">[01:53:21]</a>. That Mexican OT himself is skilled at riding horses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a> and has attempted to break them, noting it requires patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>.

## Musicality Shaped by Texas

His musical style is influenced by the diverse sounds he grew up with. While he acknowledges the influence of East Coast hip-hop artists like Big L and Nas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>, his father introduced him to genres like Eagles, Rage Against the Machine, Metallica, Green Day, and The Offspring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>. His song "Cowboy Killer" is explicitly influenced by blues music, which he grew up "jamming" to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

He also utilizes "screwed" (slowed-down) vocals in his music, a technique popularized in Texas hip-hop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. His music reflects his authentic self, leading to greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>. He sees his cowboy image and unique sound as differentiating him from other artists who might chase trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:41">[01:33:41]</a>.

## Personal Background and Outlook

[[that_mexican_ots_upbringing_and_early_life_influences | His upbringing]] in Bay City, Palacios, and West Columbia was marked by challenging circumstances. His mother dealt crack and cocaine, sometimes involving him in dangerous situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>. These experiences, including incidents where his mother was involved in fights or dealt drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:51">[01:43:51]</a>, contributed to his worldview.

Despite these hardships, he has a strong bond with his father, who always believed in his rapping abilities, even when he doubted himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>. This unwavering support from his father instilled a "supreme confidence" in his own ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a>. He also attributes his athletic abilities, such as being able to do backflips despite his weight, to his father's training and emphasis on body control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>.

That Mexican OT's music and public persona are a direct reflection of his Texas roots, blending rugged authenticity with a unique musical style.

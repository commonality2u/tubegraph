Donald Trump describes his approach to international relations as being "tough with other countries" while still maintaining good relationships with their leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. He asserts that under previous administrations, the United States was "ripped off by every nation in the world," including "so-called allies," particularly in trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. He claims to have ended "dumbest trade deals" and made them "much better for the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. Trump acknowledges that not all international leaders are "sharks" but notes that many are "tough and... smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. He states that he "get[s] along with pretty much everybody" and that "the tougher they were the better [he] did with them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

## Specific International Relationships

### China
Trump recounts imposing [[Impact of Trumps tariffs on global trade | tariffs on China]], which he claims brought in "hundreds of billions of dollars" to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. He notes these tariffs are "still there" and would not exist without his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. He states he had a "very good" relationship with President Xi of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. However, this changed after COVID-19 emerged, which Trump believes came "out of the labs" in China, leading him to be "not happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. He mentions an "unbelievable trade deal" requiring China to buy $50 billion of U.S. products annually, a deal he "don't even talk about... because of COVID" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>. He claims that President Biden has not pressured China to honor this deal, which has negatively impacted American farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

### European Union (EU)
Trump asserts that the European Union was "almost as bad" as China in terms of unfair trade practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. He described the EU as "ruthless in their trading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. He cites an example with Angela Merkel, questioning why there were no Chevrolets in Berlin while the U.S. imported millions of Mercedes-Benz and BMW vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

### India
Trump considers Modi of India a friend, describing him as "the nicest human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. He notes that Modi "looks like he's your father, he's the nicest" but is a "total killer" when it comes to defending India's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>. He recalls an event in Houston, Texas, called "Howdy Modi," where he and Modi filled a stadium with 80,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.

### Iran
Trump states he "was rough with Iran" but wants to see them "do great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:59">[02:09:59]</a>. He believes Iran has an "open threat" against him and attributes the recent [[Trumps alleged assassination attempt | assassination attempt]] to them, based on shooters having foreign-based apps and cell phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:59">[02:10:59]</a>. He suggests that President Biden should threaten to "bomb that country into oblivion" if they harm a former president to deter such threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. Trump also claims he "would have had a deal with Iran" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:28">[01:27:28]</a>.

### Japan
Trump mentions renegotiating the trade deal with Japan with Shinzo Abe, who he describes as "incredible" and a "great man" and leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. Abe acknowledged the trade deal was "one-sided" in Japan's favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

### Russia
Trump states that Russia would "never have attacked Ukraine" if he were president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>. He claims to have talked to Putin about it and "got along great with him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. He references ending the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, questioning why the U.S. would defend Europe from Russia while Europe paid Russia "billions of dollars a month for oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. He criticizes Biden for reinstating the pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. Despite perceptions of being "friends with Putin," Trump claims Putin would say, "if you're my friend I'd hate like hell to see you as my enemy," and that he "put a lot of sanctions on" Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.

### South Korea
Trump also "redid the trade deal" with South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.

## Peace Efforts
Trump claims his presidency saw "no wars in the whole world because of me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. He states he stopped "a lot of wars" and saved "thousands of lives" by threatening to cut off business and impose tariffs on countries fighting each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:09">[01:24:09]</a>. He highlights his administration's accomplishments with the Abraham Accords in the Middle East, stating that "diplomacy out in that region... hasn't existed prior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>. He believes the world will not "end in the Middle East" under his leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>.

## Nuclear Weapons
Trump expresses concern about nuclear war, calling it the "biggest threat we have in the world today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. He states that during his presidency, the U.S. was "close to a deal for getting rid of nuclear weapons" with Russia and China, with the intention of bringing "everyone else into it" to "totally denuclearize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. He mentions his uncle, Dr. John Trump, a nuclear scientist at MIT, who warned him about the danger of small briefcase-sized bombs destroying cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

Logan Paul has repeatedly alleged that boxing legend Floyd Mayweather has not paid him for their exhibition boxing match, which took place in June 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Paul referred to Mayweather as a "punch drunk idiot" and questioned where his money was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Unpaid Earnings and Legal Action

According to Logan Paul, Floyd Mayweather owes him "millions" from their fight, estimating the amount to be over $2 million but probably just under $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Paul states that the money was not held in escrow, which is a common practice for high-profile fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

Paul claims that Mayweather, due to his extensive experience in boxing, "knows how to allocate money really conveniently to make it look like it's an expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. He further alleges that Mayweather engages in "under the table deals, cash deals, using my name and likeness without telling me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

Mayweather is reportedly facing a lawsuit in New York related to this, specifically accused of taking a $10 million cash payment "under the table or something with like ticketing or something" and selling rights to entities like Qatar without sharing a percentage with Paul, despite Paul being entitled to a cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Paul indicated he would pursue the matter in court, stating, "we'll see you in court bucko" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. He noted that his lawsuit would be the second for the same event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Mayweather's Financial Situation

Paul suggested that Mayweather is "on his way" to being broke if he doesn't continue doing exhibition fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. He referenced Mayweather's fight against Don Moore in the Middle East as an example of these exhibitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Reflections on the Fight

Logan Paul shared his perspective on their fight, which he described as "weird" because "on paper that fight never should have happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. He highlighted that he lasted eight rounds and even "pieced him up a little bit," proudly stating that Floyd Mayweather is on his highlight reel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

Paul claimed to have "popped his eardrum" with an overhand right, which he believes "hurt him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. He emphasized this, noting that Mayweather, known as "the ghost" and "greatest fighter of all time," was hit by a YouTuber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

Paul perceived Mayweather as surprisingly "slow" and not hitting hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. He recalled seeing Mayweather's punches in the first round and realizing, "he's not going to knock me out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. Paul, being 30 pounds heavier than Mayweather, believed his size and length were advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. He recalled Mayweather in his corner stating, "it's hard to hit him with a jab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.

A suggestion was made by an interviewer that Mayweather might have confused Logan with his brother, [[jake_pauls_boxing_career | Jake Paul]], seeking "retribution" after Jake's previous fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>. Logan called this idea "absurd" but acknowledged the possibility of Mayweather being unfamiliar with their world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.

## Impact on Logan Paul's Career

Despite the financial dispute, Paul acknowledged that the fight was a significant moment for his career. He stated that being involved in "the most entertaining thing happening" at that moment meant he accomplished his goal of becoming the biggest entertainer in the world at 26 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:25:00">[55:25:00]</a>. This fight was a primary example of how his boxing matches and WWE appearances have universal appeal, unlike some of his more niche content like his *99 Originals* project, which appeals to a specific audience interested in art, stories, NFTs, and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:12">[01:49:12]</a>.

He explained that his fight with Mayweather, along with other boxing matches, allowed him to "earn respect in a different way and show my character, my real character" following a major public controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This is further elaborated in his reflections on how his rivalry with [[the_rivalry_and_subsequent_business_partnership_between_logan_paul_and_ksi | KSI]] provided an opportunity for "redemption" through fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

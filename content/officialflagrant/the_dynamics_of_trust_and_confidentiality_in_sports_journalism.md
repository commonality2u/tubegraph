Sports journalism, particularly the realm of opinion and commentary, operates on a complex foundation of earned trust and maintained confidentiality. Historically, the right to express a public opinion in sports was not universally granted but earned through rigorous journalistic progression and demonstrated integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Earning the Right to Opinion
In earlier eras, becoming a "columnist" in the newspaper industry was the pinnacle for a journalist, as it was the only position specifically "allowed and licensed to give the opinion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This required ascending through multiple ranks, from high school and college reporter to features writer and pro writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Stephen A. Smith, for instance, earned his columnist position at the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003, becoming only the 21st black person in American history to achieve that title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

This contrasts sharply with the modern landscape where "everybody can have an opinion" immediately on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. While embracing this broader participation, seasoned journalists emphasize the importance of respecting those who "came before you to pave the way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The ability to express opinions on a public platform today is built upon the groundwork laid by earlier generations who "had to put up with shit that you never had to deal with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## The Journalist's Code and Confidentiality
A cornerstone of maintaining trust in sports journalism is adhering to a strict "code" of confidentiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This code dictates what information is shared publicly and what remains private. Journalists often know "75% more than what we reveal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, with some estimating they hold back as much as "80% of the stuff that I know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This practice is crucial because "if you say everything no one will trust you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Building trust involves proving oneself as someone who can "keep secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

This principle extends to the personal lives of athletes. A reputable journalist does not concern themselves with "what's going on in your personal life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, unless it directly impacts their performance on the field or court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Information regarding "affairs" or "drugs" that are personal matters are considered "crossing the line" and are not to be reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. The focus remains on "stuff that's relevant to the sport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>, such as locker room conflicts affecting team play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

### Distinguishing Journalists from Bloggers
The rise of new media has blurred lines, with some individuals prioritizing "clout" and "click bait" over journalistic integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. These "bloggers" might immediately share any "juicy information" they acquire, rather than using it to build long-term trust with sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. True members of the media understand that holding back information is "part of the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Dealing with Manipulation and Veracity
Journalists often receive information from team management, coaches, or opposing teams, sometimes with the intent that it be used to gain an advantage or instigate conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. The primary concern for the journalist in these situations is "the veracity of the information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. If the information is truthful, it can be used, even if it leads to "wars between teams, players" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. However, lying to a journalist is unacceptable; "you lie to me one time I'ma roast your ass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

### Maintaining Relationships with Players
Despite the need for critical reporting, a long-standing relationship with players can be maintained through mutual respect for the aforementioned code. Stephen A. Smith, for example, has had intense disagreements with players like Allen Iverson, even going "eight months without speaking to each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Yet, these relationships often endure because the journalist's critiques are "fact-based" and do not violate personal boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Players know that if a journalist is heated, it's often because the other party "knows I know" the truth, but they are taking advantage of what cannot be publicly revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

In one instance, Stephen A. Smith had a public confrontation with Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson, which led to years of not speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Years later, reflecting on the incident and seeing Robinson's son, Smith apologized, acknowledging that as the journalist, it was "my obligation to be the professional and the grown-up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. This demonstrates the long-term responsibility and self-reflection required to maintain credibility in the field.

## Transparency and Public Perception
While maintaining confidentiality is key, Stephen A. Smith also highlights the importance of being authentic and transparent in one's public persona. He actively seeks to convey that his on-screen persona "that's what I do, that's not who I am" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>. He believes in being open about his personal life and views beyond sports, as it reflects how people genuinely discuss a multitude of topics at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58">[01:42:58]</a>. This transparency contributes to a deeper connection with the audience, showing that his strong [[the_significance_of_having_and_expressing_opinions_in_sports_journalism | opinions]] extend beyond sports to relationships and [[the_role_of_social_issues_and_politics_in_sports | social issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:26">[01:42:26]</a>.

The [[the_dynamics_of_media_entertainment_and_authenticity_in_public_life | media landscape]] has evolved, with some trying to use personal enticements to influence journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. However, for a professional, the risk to one's career and "money" acts as a strong deterrent against such temptations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. Guarding one's reputation and avoiding compromising situations is paramount to preserving [[media_manipulation_and_journalism_integrity | journalistic integrity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

Dillon Danis was sued by Logan Paul's fianc√©e, Nina Agdal, following his online behavior leading up to the fight between Danis and Paul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. This lawsuit became a significant point of discussion, with Danis addressing it in multiple interviews, including one with Ariel Helwani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.

## Background of the Lawsuit

According to Danis, the lawsuit stemmed from his public comments and posts about Nina Agdal, which he claims were part of his strategy to promote the fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. He characterized the lawsuit as "corny" and argued that such legal action is unusual in fight promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

Danis believes that Nina Agdal is "part of him" (referring to Logan Paul) and therefore fair game in the context of fight promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. He further justified his actions by stating that Agdal is a public figure, which he believes makes her fair game for comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. He claimed that "there was just so much on her" online and that she became more popular due to his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## Allegations and Defenses

The lawsuit specifically included defamation charges, with Danis mentioning an allegation he made about Agdal having HIV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>. He questions the legality of suing over such statements, referencing freedom of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. Danis also noted that Logan Paul had made counter-allegations about Danis's mother being a prostitute, suggesting a potential for mutual defamation lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>.

Danis maintained that all the content he posted about Agdal was already publicly available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:14">[02:24:14]</a>. He denies hacking her iPad or fabricating content, asserting that he only used publicly accessible pictures without captions in the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

## Public Perception and Impact

Danis noted that the general public and the MMA community widely consider the lawsuit "corny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:37">[03:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. No one publicly supported the lawsuit, with many seeing it as setting a "bad precedent for fighters going forward" by turning fight promotion into legal battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:51">[03:02:51]</a>.

Despite the legal action, Danis expressed that he gained popularity from the controversy, asserting that he didn't change his public persona ("turn face") and remained true to himself, which he believes garnered public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. He suggests that Logan Paul's attempts to portray himself as a "good guy" while being involved in such a lawsuit made him seem less genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

## Dillon Danis's Dilemma

Danis acknowledged the difficult position he was in due to the lawsuit, feeling there was "no upside" for him in the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:59">[03:10:59]</a>. If he were to pull out of the fight due to the lawsuit, he would "look like I don't want to fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:25">[03:01:25]</a>. However, continuing with the fight while being sued for promotion seemed equally unappealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:25">[03:01:25]</a>. He felt the entire situation was a "lose-lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:57">[03:00:57]</a>.

Live podcasting and stage performances are discussed, including the unique dynamics of interacting with audiences and co-hosts in a live setting. The hosts, Bobby Lee and Santino, reflect on their individual performing styles, comfort levels, and the distinct nature of their comedic and stage interactions.

## On-Stage Persona and Audience Interaction
Bobby Lee describes his on-stage persona as one where he feels he "can do whatever I want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. He admits to having previously shown his penis on stage, which he claims was "fine" with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. This act, described as "playful" and "fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a> rather than threatening due to its perceived size, reportedly gave male audience members "a boost of confidence" and amused the girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. However, this behavior led to him being "beat up twice by the audience members" years ago, prompting him to stop showing his penis on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>. He now adheres to these "public rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.

## Dynamics with Co-Hosts
The show explores the dynamic between Bobby Lee, Santino, and Akash, often positioning Akash and Bobby as the "wacky neighbor[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a> in the on-stage chemistry. Santino often characterizes Bobby Lee as the "more wacky" one in real situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>, prone to extreme reactions like following someone home after a traffic incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. Bobby Lee states he will do "literally anything" for laughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>.

## Performing for Different Audiences
The comedians discuss how different audiences affect their performances. Performing in one's hometown, like Chicago for Santino, is described as one of his "least favorite things" due to the added stress of family and friends attending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. He notes it's like "a nightmare" with non-stop phone calls and demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>. This is contrasted with how fighters prefer not to fight at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.

## The Future of Live Podcasting
The "Bad Friends" podcast, co-hosted by Bobby Lee and Santino, is planning a "movie theater tour" for the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:47">[01:30:47]</a>. This format will combine stand-up comedy with a live podcast, featuring "improv" and "impromptu" interactions rather than just talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>. They believe their podcast is uniquely suited for live performance due to the "games" and dynamic they create, unlike other podcasts that might struggle without pre-written punchlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:09">[01:31:09]</a>. This approach to [[approaching_comedy_and_podcast_events | approaching comedy and podcast events]] aims to be "absolutely hysterical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:53">[01:31:53]</a>.

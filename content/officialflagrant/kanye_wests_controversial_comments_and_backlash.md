Kanye West's recent actions and statements have drawn significant attention and discussion, particularly regarding his public persona and the resulting backlash from various entities.

## Public Reception and Intentions
Discussions around [[kanye_west_and_controversy | Kanye West's controversial statements and media backlash]] often question his motives, with some suggesting he is "using the black community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. One podcaster noted that his audience would "gas him up" saying [[kanye_west_and_controversy | Kanye West]] was "speaking the truth about those people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Some observers believe that [[kanye_west_and_controversy | Kanye West]] has an "innate urge to try to create a cult," aiming for "complete control" rather than financial gain, having already controlled the rap world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.

## Specific Controversies and Repercussions
[[kanye_west_and_controversy | Kanye West's comments]] on the death of George Floyd were highlighted, where he claimed George Floyd died from fentanyl, not from a knee on his neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. Following this, his bank accounts were reportedly canceled, leading to a quick reversal of his stance, where he acknowledged what "a knee on the neck could do" and its potential "cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. This flip-flopping was seen as hilarious by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.

Furthermore, discussions touched upon his statements regarding the Jewish community, with one individual expressing caution about speaking on such sensitive topics, stating they had "nothing to say" when the "N word comes around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, drawing a parallel to the discomfort of discussing the Jewish community.

### Financial and Label Impacts
The notion of [[kanye_west_potentially_returning_to_adidas | Kanye West potentially returning to Adidas]] or his bank accounts being canceled was a point of confusion for some, as the timing of the bank account deletion appeared to precede his public controversial tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:49">[02:26:49]</a>. It was speculated that the bank account issues might have stemmed from his money being primarily in equity, leading to loan limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:57">[02:26:57]</a>.

Similarly, the news that Good Music was no longer involved with Def Jam was reported to have happened in 2021, before recent controversies, but the timing was often disregarded in public perception to fit a specific narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:10">[02:28:10]</a>.

## Media Scrutiny and Public Perception
The speaker mentioned that their previous [[podcast_guest_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_kanye_west | podcast episode where Kanye West was discussed]] led to them being "roasted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It's noted that after the initial podcast about [[kanye_wests_controversial_statements_and_public_persona | Kanye West's controversial statements and public persona]], people were ready to believe the worst about the speaker, especially when false information about physical altercations was spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:15">[01:52:15]</a>.

The discussion highlights how some anti-establishment groups rallied behind [[kanye_west_and_controversy | Kanye West]], viewing him as fighting "against the establishment" because they reject mainstream media narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:03">[02:22:03]</a>. However, it's also noted that while distrust of mainstream media is reasonable, it doesn't excuse problematic behavior or the spread of misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:04">[02:24:04]</a>.

The importance of distinguishing between comedy and serious statements was emphasized, with the speaker noting that if they say controversial things in a comedic context, they often clarify it's a joke, but this nuance is often lost in media clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:01">[02:18:01]</a>. They state that the "luxury" of being a comedian allows for touching on "radioactive" topics that would otherwise be met with severe backlash if presented as serious ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:04">[02:08:04]</a>.

## Celebrity Reactions

This was paralleled with [[drake_and_kanye_wests_relationship_and_personalities | LeBron James']] similar public statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:31">[02:35:31]</a>.

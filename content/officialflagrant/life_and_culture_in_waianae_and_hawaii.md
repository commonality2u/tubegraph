## Waianae: A Unique Hawaiian Community

Waianae is described as a specific part of Hawaii that has largely avoided gentrification, though there is a growing concern that "the whites are coming" [00:01:10]. The local culture is characterized by extreme generosity, where someone might "literally give you the back of their [...] shirt off their back," or by conflict, where "you just get beaten off" [00:01:50]. Locals often have a particular look due to the sun in their eyes, not an indication of unfriendliness, and kindness is reciprocated with kindness [00:02:05].

Despite his superstar status, Max Holloway continues to live in Waianae, having recently acquired land and moved "deeper into Waianae" towards his wife's family [00:03:58]. His local roots are deep, having attended Waianae Elementary, Intermediate, and High School [00:03:10]. Due to his long-standing presence, he can walk around without being harassed, as the community is familiar with him [00:02:51].

## The Paradox of Hawaiian Fighting Culture

Hawaiians are noted for being "the kindest, sweetest, most welcoming people that also will fight" [00:06:59]. This dual nature is attributed to [[the_influence_of_hawaiian_culture_on_max_holloways_fighting_style | Hawaiian culture]], which historically emphasized "hand-to-hand contacts" as they lacked weapons until colonization [00:07:30].

The traditional Hawaiian fighting style, "Lua," is described as a martial art that is "very grungy" and involves tactics like "grabbing sand," "grabbing testicles and twisting," and "pulling up" [00:07:57]. Historically, Hawaiian warriors would bring women to fights, as girls were also considered warriors and fought on the frontline [00:08:28].

## Local Pride and Overcoming Obstacles

There is a significant "ego" among Waianae residents, who are described as "the biggest egotistical guys ever" [00:38:30]. This strong sense of identity often manifests as a desire to prove doubters wrong, especially when told that success requires moving to the mainland [00:38:43]. Max Holloway sought to prove that with a good group of committed individuals, one could achieve high levels of success without leaving Hawaii [00:36:45].

Holloway initially believed he was "owed something" by the world due to his Waianae background, but realized upon entering the "real world" that "if you want anything in this life, you go work hard for it" [00:39:01]. He aims to convey this message to the younger generation in Waianae, working with the Boys and Girls Club and DSC to potentially open a gym facility [00:39:17].

He shared his own story of being a "hard-headed kid" who frequently got into trouble and often sat next to the vice principal [00:39:44]. He emphasizes that "it's not how you start, it's how you finish" [00:39:56], highlighting that his success came from believing in himself and receiving help from others, including sitting next to the smartest kid in class to get answers [00:40:27].

## Cultural Differences and Observations

Max Holloway's first trip to the mainland was at 18, to Crescent, Iowa [00:42:07]. He described the experience of a snowstorm and living in a house without a heater, having to dress like he was going to an ice skating rink every night [00:43:29]. He observed cultural practices like "teepee-ing" houses, a concept he thought only happened on Disney Channel [00:44:37]. He personally found wasting food or toilet paper unappealing [00:45:29].

Regarding relationships, he noted that he was "so used to Hawaiian girls" that Midwest women were "different" to him [00:46:08].

Hawaiian Pidgin, or "Pigeon," is a language spoken in Hawaii, which the speaker can speak fluently [01:13:00]. It is now recognized as an actual language [01:14:01].

## Challenges with Tourism and Governance

Hawaii faces issues with its tourism authority, the HTA, which makes it difficult to host major professional fighting events despite Hawaii having two main professional sports: fighting and surfing [01:08:00]. The HTA's reluctance stems from a concern about attracting a particular "fan base" [01:08:52], despite allowing events like the Pro Bowl, where NFL players themselves have been known to fight in clubs [01:09:11].

There is also a complex system regarding land ownership, where non-Hawaiians can only lease land for 100 years and then it must be transferred to someone who meets specific Hawaiian qualifications [01:52:04]. However, "money talks," and people find ways around these rules, as seen with Larry Ellison's purchase of an entire island [01:52:42].

Additionally, there are ongoing issues with a controversial rail project in Hawaii, which is a state project being audited and for which other islands that cannot use it are also being taxed [01:10:04].

## Surfing Culture and Dangers

Surfing spots in Hawaii often require individuals to "earn your respect and your right to even catch waves" [01:16:19]. Places like Pipeline are extremely dangerous, with waves that can be 20 feet high over only "two, three feet of water overlay sharp reef" [01:16:45]. Surfers can hit their faces on the reef, drown, or get trapped underneath moving sets of waves, leading to fatalities [01:17:31]. The reefs have "pockets" where one can fall and become disoriented, unable to tell which way is up [01:18:18].

While women can be in charge in surfing, they "gotta be girls in charge" [01:18:40]. Max Holloway's wife is a professional surfer who has surfed Pipeline, indicating her high skill level [01:19:07]. He views surfing as more dangerous than fighting, stating that while a fighter can "control somebody," "mother nature is going to slam you" with no "time out" [01:19:26].

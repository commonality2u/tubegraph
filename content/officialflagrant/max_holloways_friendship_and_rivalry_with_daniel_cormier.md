Max Holloway shares a unique and multifaceted relationship with Daniel "DC" Cormier, characterized by a blend of genuine friendship, playful rivalry, and ongoing banter. Holloway often expresses his affection for Cormier while simultaneously engaging in lighthearted trash talk and competitive challenges.

## ESPN Show Incident
Holloway revealed that Cormier approached him about a potential short idea for ESPN, where "people let me talk about my business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>. Holloway told Cormier he was "down" but needed to figure out a schedule due to his fighting career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>. However, weeks and months passed in silence before Holloway saw the "RC DC show" launch, indicating Cormier proceeded without him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>. Holloway jokingly called Cormier "the worst" and "lucky he's the heavyweight champion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:30">[02:22:30]</a>, asserting that without the title, Cormier is "nothing to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:34">[02:22:34]</a>.

## Competitive Challenges
Holloway frequently challenges Cormier to a fight, often in the heavyweight division, stating that "if the money is right brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:30">[02:27:30]</a> he would do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>. He jokingly suggests they could aim for a payout of "five mil" or higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:46">[02:46:46]</a>. Holloway asserts he could beat Cormier in a "hands" fight, as well as in "wrestling, the eating, whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>. He even threatens to take all of Cormier's post-fighting jobs after his own retirement, including Cormier's desire to be a garbage man in his town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>.

## "Fraudulent" Background
Holloway humorously exposed Cormier's remote studio setup, claiming DC would call him to show off his changing virtual backgrounds, such as a gym, a bookshelf, or his belts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>. Max called him a "fraud" for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:19">[02:16:19]</a>.

## Wrestling Offer and Suspicions
Cormier invited Holloway to train wrestling with him, saying "let me know when it comes then" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:53">[02:54:53]</a>. However, Holloway declined due to Cormier's teammate, Islam Makhachev, who Max might want to fight one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>. Holloway suspected Cormier would "be a spy for Islam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a> if they trained together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:10">[02:10:10]</a>.

Despite the back-and-forth, Holloway consistently affirms his love for Cormier, framing their rivalry as a form of playful competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:58">[02:58:58]</a>.

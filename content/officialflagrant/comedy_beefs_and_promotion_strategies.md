The world of [[Comedy and Standup]] and entertainment often sees different strategies for promotion and maintaining relevance, with some comedians opting for direct confrontations or "beefs" to generate buzz. This approach, while effective, challenges traditional [[comedy_and_comedian_interactions_and_dynamics | comedic norms]] and raises questions about professional conduct.

## The Cat Williams Phenomenon
[[Cat Williams]] is highlighted as potentially "the greatest marketer in the history of [[Comedy and Standup | comedy]]" due to his unique approach to [[bert_kreischers_comedy_tours_and_promotional_strategies | promoting]] his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. Following a single podcast interview, he reportedly sold out his next tour multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. His strategy involves mixing truth with made-up stories, which is seen as "very entertaining" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. Despite making numerous claims against various individuals, including Harvey Weinstein, no lawsuits have been filed against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.

It is suggested that his influence might even overshadow major news, such as the Epstein file revelations, which occurred on the same day his podcast interview garnered 38 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

### Breaking the "Comedy Code"
The [[Comedy and Standup | comedy]] industry is perceived to have an unwritten "code" against publicly attacking other comedians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. Cat Williams' direct call-outs of other comedians challenged this norm, drawing parallels to how artists in hip-hop create buzz through diss tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. This strategy is typically seen from "desperate comics" struggling for relevance or harboring resentment, but Williams' standing makes his use of it unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.

### Post-Interview Actions
Cat Williams further intensified the "beef" by reportedly taking [[Kevin Hart]]'s ex-wife, Torrei Hart, who is also a comedian, on select dates of his new tour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>. This move is described as "dirty business" and "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>, seen as a deliberate attempt to annoy or embarrass Kevin Hart and leverage personal history for [[comedic_career_development_and_social_media_strategies | career gain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

## Lawsuits and Comedic Retort
The discussion also delved into instances where legal action was considered in response to public criticism or jokes in the [[Comedy and Standup | comedy]] sphere.

### Comedians vs. Comedians
It's argued that when one comedian makes fun of another, the appropriate response should be more jokes, not lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. The case of [[Kevin Hart]] suing Tasha K is mentioned, noting that Tasha K is not a comedian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.

### Jimmy Kimmel vs. Aaron Rodgers
The perceived overreaction of [[Jimmy Kimmel]] to [[Aaron Rodgers]]' jokes about him being on the Epstein list is criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. Kimmel's threat of legal action is seen as "corny" for a comedian of his stature, who should have responded with humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. It is asserted that if a comedian starts a verbal jab, they shouldn't be upset if it's returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

### Accusations of Joke Stealing
A comedian suing another for accusations of stealing jokes or being "not funny" would be understandable, as it directly impacts ticket sales and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>. However, the ideal response would still be to "clown him in a way that will reverse any of that damage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.

## Hosting Awards Shows
Hosting major awards shows like the Golden Globes presents a unique challenge for comedians due to the self-absorbed and camera-aware nature of the Hollywood audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>.

### Ricky Gervais's Approach
[[Ricky Gervais]] is lauded for his successful approach to hosting, characterized by an unapologetic, trolling attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. He communicates that he "doesn't give a shit" about Hollywood's perceptions, which is "intoxicating" to an audience that cares deeply about validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. His jokes are "biting" and force the audience to react to avoid appearing humorless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>. A key example is his joke about Leonardo DiCaprio's dating habits and the length of *The Irishman* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>, which is clever and allows the audience to feel smart for understanding the reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>.

### Joe Koy's Performance
Joe Koy's recent hosting of the Golden Globes is discussed, with the consensus being a "tough situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. It's noted that he had only 10 days to prepare for an "audience that's like kind of a nightmare situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. Unlike Gervais, Koy's visible desire to succeed and the lack of expected laughter from the audience seemingly "rattled him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>. His joke about [[Taylor Swift]] and NFL cutaways is seen as not "biting" enough, leading to a negative online reaction from "Swifties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>. Koy's choice to blame his writers on stage is criticized as a defensive move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

## Internal Drama as Promotion
The strategy of using internal company drama for public promotion is highlighted through Pat McAfee's actions at ESPN.

### Pat McAfee's ESPN Strategy
Pat McAfee publicly accused Norby Williamson, a high-ranking ESPN executive, of attempting to sabotage his show, calling him a "rat" and a "douche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:03">[01:36:03]</a>. Despite the severity of the accusations, ESPN took no action against McAfee, who later posted a photo with another high-ranking executive, calling him a "good friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:03">[01:37:03]</a>. This tactic is compared to how Barstool Sports and the Kardashians use internal drama to draw in and monetize audience engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:23">[01:37:23]</a>, essentially creating an "internal drama" playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. This strategy makes audiences care about the drama and draws attention to the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:48">[01:37:48]</a>.

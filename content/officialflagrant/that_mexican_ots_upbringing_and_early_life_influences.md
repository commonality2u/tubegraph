That Mexican OT's upbringing in Texas, particularly areas like Bay City and Palacios, profoundly shaped his outlook, music, and personal development. His childhood was marked by a unique blend of rural Texas culture, exposure to violence and substance use, and strong, albeit complex, [[the_role_of_family_and_relationships_in_that_mexican_ots_life | family dynamics]].

## Texas Roots and Lifestyle
That Mexican OT grew up steeped in [[the_influence_of_texas_culture_and_lifestyle_on_that_mexican_ots_music | Texas culture]]. As a child, he recalls having a trampoline and a pool at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. He often tells stories that reflect his unique environment, such as freezing paintballs with his "Kinfolk" to shoot at people in New York projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Gun culture was a significant part of his life from an early age. He describes always carrying a gun, sometimes two ARs in the car, and even having one in church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For him, a gun is as essential as a wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This deep integration of firearms stems from a perceived need for self-protection, influenced by stories from his community, such as a funeral where the opposition stole the casket with the body in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. He recounts instances where he had to display a weapon to de-escalate situations, particularly at "land parties" where people on drugs might become confrontational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

He also participated in hog hunting, a common activity in Texas due to hogs being a nuisance to land and crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. This activity involved using trucks and sometimes helicopters to hunt, cook, or simply leave the hogs for other animals to devour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. He mentions the prevalence of alligators in Texas, particularly around the Gulf of Mexico where rivers flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

## Family and Social Environment
His [[the_role_of_family_and_relationships_in_that_mexican_ots_life | family and relationships]] played a crucial role in his upbringing.
*   **Father:** His father, Chuck, was a significant influence. He describes his dad as having incredible energy, earning respect without being gang-affiliated in prison, and being a "political ass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Despite his father's time in prison, they maintained a close relationship, with OT visiting him and even trying to take prison coins home because he missed his dad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:34">[01:24:34]</a>. His father also trained him physically, emphasizing bodyweight control, and would wake him up before school to rap battle grown men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a>. His father was a strong believer in his musical talent from a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:48">[01:37:48]</a>.
*   **Mother:** His mother was involved in dealing crack and cocaine in Bay City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. She was described as "savage" and fearless, even smacking someone in the head with a brick of cocaine when irritated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. She had him at a young age and was still "being a kid" herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. He was often taken care of by his uncle, who was younger than his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.
*   **Grandparents:** His paternal grandfather, Chico, was a "black cowboy of the century" who passed away at 99. He was known for breaking horses and ranch maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>.
*   **Cousins and Friends:** He grew up with cousins and friends who engaged in wild behaviors, including a "legally lunatic" homeboy who tried to wrestle an alligator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Exposure to Substance Use
[[experiences_with_substance_use_and_its_impact_on_that_mexican_ot | Experiences with substance use]] were present from a young age, starting around 14 in high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. He admits to doing cocaine in class, passing around a "20 sack" under the desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. He describes one instance of getting high while fishing and being intensely focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. He also recalls a particularly bad experience with cocaine where he blacked out and woke up on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:20">[02:26:20]</a>.

He was introduced to shrooms by an older girl who "slutted him out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>. He also experimented with ecstasy, specifically "blue dolphin ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:09">[02:25:09]</a>. Despite past substance use, he states he doesn't drink alcohol because he becomes "mean" and "confrontational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>, whereas drugs like shrooms make him "happy" and "friendly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:18">[02:27:18]</a>.

## Early Musicality and Personal Growth
That Mexican OT began rapping at a very young age, around three or four years old, a fact frequently brought up by his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. He would rap battle grown men, encouraged by his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>. His uncles on his mother's side were also rappers, and he started recording with them when he was a kid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>. He still uses lyrics he wrote in eighth grade in his current songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:54">[01:48:54]</a>. He attributes his "musical fluency" to this early exposure, comparing it to learning a language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

His childhood experiences, including a chip on his shoulder from feeling "robbed from everything" due to his mother's death at a young age and perceived challenges, led to bottling up anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:45">[02:22:45]</a>. He later realized this anger was unhealthy and worked to overcome it, reaching a point of self-belief around 20-21 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:47">[02:36:47]</a>. His decision to embrace his authentic "cowboy" image, rather than trying to fit a conventional rapper aesthetic, coincided with his rise to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>.

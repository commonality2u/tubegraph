During an interview on the *Flagrant* podcast, [[Donald Trumps influence in global politics | Donald Trump]] discussed his relationship with his five children, his parenting philosophy, and their roles in his life and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. He expressed pride in their success and adjustment, noting that they "appear to like" him, which is not always the case for children of wealthy parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Parenting Philosophy
Trump attributes his children's success and well-adjusted nature to a consistent rule he enforced: "No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. He emphasized this rule frequently when they were with him or leaving a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## Donald Trump Jr.
[[Donald Trumps influence in global politics | Trump]] characterized his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., as "a little wild" and "tough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. An anecdote was shared about Don Jr. inviting 200 people to [[Donald Trumps influence in global politics | Trump Tower]] for a July 4th party when his father was out of town, despite only asking for five friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. [[Donald Trumps influence in global politics | Trump]] unexpectedly showed up, yelled at everyone to "get the hell out," and Don Jr. reportedly cleaned for 36 hours afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. [[Donald Trumps influence in global politics | Trump]] confirmed the event, stating, "you can never forget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

Don Jr. is described as a good student who attended the Wharton School of Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. [[Donald Trumps influence in global politics | Trump]] stated that Don Jr. entered politics not by choice, but because he "sort of automatically" dragged the family in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. He noted that Don Jr. endured significant scrutiny during the "Russia, Russia, Russia" investigations, appearing before grand juries and Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. [[Donald Trumps influence in global politics | Trump]] called these investigations a "total hoax" by figures like Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton, and believes the experience "made him tougher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

## Ivanka Trump
[[Donald Trumps influence in global politics | Trump]] praised Ivanka, stating she "did a great job" and "didn't want anything" for herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Her primary goal was to help people get jobs, and he claimed she helped hire "like 10 million people" by visiting companies like Walmart and Exxon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. Despite the potential for a "glamorous" role, such as Ambassador to the UN (which [[Donald Trumps influence in global politics | Trump]] had considered for her), Ivanka preferred her work in job creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

## Instilling Ambition
The podcast hosts asked [[Donald Trumps influence in global politics | Trump]] how he instilled ambition in his children, especially given that many wealthy children can become "lazy" or turn to drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. [[Donald Trumps influence in global politics | Trump]] contrasted his approach with other wealthy fathers who are competitive with their sons or would be unhappy if their children surpassed them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. He stated that his own father was "so proud" and wanted him to be more successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

He noted that in sports, it's rare for sons to "supersede the father in terms of success," using golf and baseball as examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. The hosts observed that [[Donald Trumps influence in global politics | Trump]]'s entire answer to the question about his parenting was focused on how great his children are, rather than taking credit himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

## Barron Trump
Barron Trump was briefly mentioned by the hosts, noting he is 18, handsome, tall, rich, and "unleashed in New York City" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. This was brought up in the context of a question about [[Donald Trumps views on abortion and Roe v Wade | Roe v. Wade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

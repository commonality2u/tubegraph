Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson has often reflected on the pivotal moments and personal growth that shaped his career, from his early life on the streets of Queens to his global success in music, film, and business. His experiences with adversity, competition, and loyalty have deeply influenced his approach to both his art and his entrepreneurial ventures.

## Early Life and Entrepreneurial Beginnings

50 Cent's understanding of human nature and business acumen began at a very young age. He recalls starting to figure out "the human condition" and what people are afraid of—beyond just fear of life, but also fear of shame or public perception—as early as 12 to 13 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. He recounts leading his own crew in his teens, even some members older than him, in the drug trade where there was "no age limit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

After being locked up and attending a juvenile detention center and a military boot camp (which he refers to as "shock program" and "therapeutics"), he planned to return to selling drugs upon his release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. During this period, he became more observant of people, noting how some would "drop slips" (tell on others) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. He learned to manage leverage, for instance, by strategically distributing coveted items like coffee cake to maintain influence over peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

To retain his position as "the boss" upon his return, even when making less money than his crew on certain deals, he would sacrifice his own share, ensuring they always viewed him as leading the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. He developed business strategies akin to modern corporations, scaling his drug operation by moving faster and offering better deals, drawing clientele from other corners—likening it to how Amazon operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. He also recalls a quick thinking move to change the capsules of his product to avoid arrest when the DA was looking for "Bob" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

## Music Career and Industry Disruption

His entry into the music industry was marked by a similar disruptive approach. The song "How to Rob" was born out of desperation before his album's release date at Columbia Records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. He saw no greater risk than the dangers he already faced daily in Southside Jamaica, Queens, including the possibility of being shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. He strategically named everyone in the song to gain attention, knowing that if it didn't work, he would simply return to the same life he was already living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. The song quickly gained traction, with even [[nas_career_and_rivalries|Nas]] recognizing it as "kind of crazy" and disruptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

His debut album, *Get Rich or Die Tryin'*, became the largest debut in hip-hop history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. He attributes this success partly to delays at Columbia Records, which allowed anticipation to build, and his personal experiences, including being shot nine times, which made his music's themes of "life and death" feel authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. He believes artists' first albums are often their best because there are no expectations, allowing for organic success and room for error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:20">[01:39:20]</a>. His decision to step away from actively releasing music was strategic, as he believes artists are often the last to realize they've "fell off," and taking a break allows the audience to miss them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:25">[01:40:25]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Resilience

A life-changing event for 50 Cent was being shot nine times. He describes the sensation as a piercing and burning, like a "gun poke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:46">[02:12:46]</a>. This experience, while not the first time he'd been shot at, was the first time he was hit multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:51">[02:14:51]</a>. He believes this incident changed his trajectory, cementing the authenticity of his music's themes of survival and making "Get Rich or Die Tryin'" a true reflection of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Immediately after being shot, his primary focus was not to let his crew see him hurt, maintaining a leadership facade even in the hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:57">[02:15:57]</a>.

## Reflections on Rivalries and Relationships

50 Cent has a unique perspective on his numerous beefs and relationships in the industry. He believes that genuine beefs are competitive rather than hateful, and he finds no reason to "dislike the person" years later if there was no "merit" to the initial conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:24">[02:02:24]</a>. He maintains respect for competitors, stating, "you can't be good if you can't hear good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:37">[02:02:37]</a>, implying the need for strong rivals to push one's own craft.

He openly discusses his long-standing issues with [[jay_z_business_ventures_and_cultural_influence|Jay-Z]], which he views primarily as competitive rather than personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. He claims [[jay_z_business_ventures_and_cultural_influence|Jay-Z]] attempted to block his participation in the Super Bowl halftime show, only for Eminem to refuse to perform if 50 Cent wasn't included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>. He attributes much of [[jay_z_business_ventures_and_cultural_influence|Jay-Z]]'s later career success and accolades to his marriage to Beyoncé, connecting him to a larger, more influential brand of "black excellence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

His relationship with Eminem is particularly strong, as Eminem often praises 50 Cent's rapping skills, and 50 Cent sees Eminem as unparalleled in his dedication to the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>. Eminem's unwavering support and the mutual respect for their artistry are evident in their long-standing partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>.

On the current [[drake_and_kendrick_lamars_rap_rivalry|Drake and Kendrick Lamar]] beef, 50 Cent believes the lawsuit against [[drake_and_kendrick_lamars_rap_rivalry|Kendrick Lamar]] was a strategic move to prevent the song "Like That" from being performed at the Super Bowl due to its controversial lyrics about pedophilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. He sympathizes with the position of being "on top" where "everybody wants to take a shot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>, a situation he has experienced extensively throughout his career.

## Business Ventures and Media Savvy

50 Cent discusses his diverse business ventures, including his success with Vitamin Water. He deliberately chose to invest in a beverage company rather than spirits, which was a common path for artists at the time, because he wanted to "go the other way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:29">[01:53:29]</a>. This contrarian approach led to significant financial success when Coca-Cola acquired Vitamin Water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:39">[01:53:39]</a>. He also notes his early adoption of Bitcoin as a payment method for his *Animal Ambition* album in 2014, a move that would have yielded $71 million today if he had held onto the 700 Bitcoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

His transition into Hollywood is characterized by his refusal to compromise his authentic personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. He views Hollywood as being driven by fear, and he asserts his unyielding stance on certain non-negotiable elements of his creative process. His show, *Power*, was initially rejected by several networks, but he believed in the storylines and incorporated original music into the pitch to secure a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:29]</a>. He emphasizes that the success of *Power* stems from his grounded, real-life experience, contrasting it with Hollywood's often inauthentic portrayal of urban narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>. He recounts battling network executives who wanted unrealistic plot points, such as his character killing an old lady, pushing for more grounded, character-driven reasons for extreme actions, like drug use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>.

He continues to expand his media empire, with 41 shows across 10 networks, and plans to lean into AI technology for film production to enhance efficiency and creative possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:52">[02:30:52]</a>.

## Outlook and Philosophy

50 Cent maintains a philosophy of not taking himself or others too seriously, especially in the age of social media. He believes that taking oneself too seriously can "mess up everything" and lead to an artificial persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:47">[01:54:47]</a>. He also emphasizes the importance of not allowing negative comments or public opinion to affect one's emotions, as it gives critics a "win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>. He embraces his role as an entertainer, even if it means generating upset or anger, because it still serves the purpose of entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:01">[02:24:01]</a>. He intentionally does not block people on social media, believing they might "change their mind" later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:56">[02:22:56]</a>. His approach to business is rooted in experience, suggesting that information is available to those willing to read and observe their situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:40">[01:52:40]</a>.

He acknowledges that his journey, marked by numerous challenges and transformations, has uniquely prepared him for his multifaceted career, always finding opportunities where others see obstacles.

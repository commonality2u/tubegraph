Comedian Shane Gillis often shares his unique perspectives and appreciation for various historical figures, frequently drawing from his personal interests and comedic takes on historical events.

## Military and Religious Leaders

Shane Gillis expresses admiration for figures across different historical periods, often highlighting their unique traits or contributions.

### Father William Corby
Shane Gillis holds a particular appreciation for Father William Corby, a priest and military chaplain during the American Civil War. Gillis owns a painting of Corby in his living room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41">[01:41]</a>. His admiration stems from Corby's post-war role as the President of Notre Dame, where he was instrumental in rebuilding the university after a fire, a feat Gillis describes as being a "beast" and the "second founder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55">[01:55]</a>. Gillis also notes Corby's bravery on the battlefield, administering last rites to soldiers while under fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12">[02:12]</a>.

### Civil War Generals

Gillis frequently discusses American Civil War generals, offering his distinct takes on their personalities and military prowess.

*   **Robert E. Lee**
    Despite the historical context, Gillis regards Robert E. Lee as arguably the "greatest of all time" among generals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36">[03:36]</a>. He bases this on Lee's ability to achieve significant results with limited resources, stating Lee "wasn't working with a lot" and "did good with what he had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40">[03:40]</a>.

*   **Stonewall Jackson**
    Shane Gillis speculates that Stonewall Jackson was "clearly 100%" autistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56">[04:56]</a>. This theory is based on traits described in a book about Jackson, *Rebel Yell*, such as his consistent hand-holding due to an injury to prevent blood flow and his belief that God would decide his death, making him fearless in battle, which earned him the "Stonewall" moniker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17">[05:17]</a>. Gillis recounts an anecdote where Jackson remained at attention for days after being ordered to by a commanding officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46">[05:46]</a>.

*   **Ulysses S. Grant**
    In contrast to Lee, Gillis suggests that Ulysses S. Grant perceived Lee as "soft" and a "coward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37">[06:37]</a>. He describes Grant as a "failure drunk" who was working as a cashier at his father's grocery store before the Civil War, then "just became a president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01">[08:01]</a>.

### Napoleon Bonaparte
Gillis initially posits Napoleon as the "greatest of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[04:17]</a>. He later details Napoleon's revolutionary approach to warfare, suggesting he "invented" "Total War" by mobilizing the entire country's industry and population for the war effort, a departure from the "gentlemanly" combat conventions of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:56">[53:56]</a>.

### Cyrus the Great
Shane briefly mentions learning about Cyrus the Great, describing him as a "great like Persian" figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23">[10:23]</a>. However, he then expresses a general skepticism about ancient history, stating, "no one knows, no one knows, it's all made up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38">[10:38]</a>, and referencing Napoleon's quote: "History is a set of lies agreed upon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41">[10:41]</a>.

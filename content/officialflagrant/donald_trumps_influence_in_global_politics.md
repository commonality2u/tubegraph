Donald Trump has discussed his approach to global politics, emphasizing his view on international trade, relationships with world leaders, and handling global threats.

## Foreign Policy Principles

Trump believes the United States was "ripped off by every nation in the world" under previous administrations, including by its "so-called allies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:11">[03:44:11]</a>. He asserts that he "ended some of the dumbest trade deals" he had ever seen and renegotiated them to be "much better for the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a>. He suggests that his strength and ability to negotiate allowed him to achieve better outcomes for the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:50">[04:06:50]</a>.

He attributes his ability to navigate global leaders to his unique blend of experience as a businessman and politician, stating that he is "good at say meet the fake press" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>.

## Key International Relationships and Initiatives

### Trade Deals
Trump renegotiated trade agreements, including those with Japan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:48">[03:10:48]</a>. He cited an example with Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who acknowledged the trade deal was "so one-sided" that he knew Trump would "catch us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. He also criticized the European Union for being "ruthless in their trading," noting the imbalance in car imports compared to American cars in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:08">[03:52:08]</a>.

Regarding China, Trump imposed tariffs, which he claims brought in "hundreds of billions of dollars" to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. He mentioned an "unbelievable trade deal" with China that required them to buy $50 billion worth of American products annually, a deal he believes President Biden has not enforced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

### Relationships with Leaders
Trump described his interactions with various global leaders:
*   **Narendra Modi (India):** Described as a "friend" and the "nicest human being," but also a "total killer" in negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Trump recounted an instance where he offered to help Modi with a country threatening India, only for Modi to state, "we've defeated them for hundreds of years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Xi Jinping (China):** Trump stated he got along "very well" with President Xi, but he was unhappy after the COVID-19 pandemic, which he believes came from a Chinese lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
*   **Vladimir Putin (Russia):** Trump believes Russia would "have never attacked Ukraine if I were president" because he "got along great with him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. He also claimed to have ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which he says Biden later "gave it back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. Trump stated that Putin himself would say, "if you're my friend I'd hate like hell to see you as my enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Angela Merkel (Germany):** He challenged Merkel on the lack of American cars in Berlin despite German car imports into the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Queen Elizabeth II (United Kingdom):** Trump mentioned being honored by the Queen at Buckingham Palace, an event he believes his Scottish mother would have "loved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

### Global Peace Efforts
Trump claims his administration prevented wars and promoted peace globally, stating, "when I was President we had no wars in the whole world because of me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. He cited stopping conflicts between two countries that had "fought for thousands of years," threatening to cut off business with the U.S. if they didn't make peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:07">[01:24:07]</a>.

He also highlighted the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements between Israel and Arab nations, as a significant diplomatic achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>. He expressed concern about the world ending in the Middle East and stated, "we're not going to let that happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>.

### Nuclear Threats
Trump views nuclear war as the "biggest threat we have in the world today," not global warming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. He stated that his administration was "close to a deal for getting rid of nuclear weapons" with Russia and China, aiming for total denuclearization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Perceived Foreign Influence and Threats
Regarding an assassination attempt, Trump speculated on foreign involvement, noting that one shooter's cell phones had foreign-based apps that the FBI had not opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. He believes Iran, which he says has an "open threat" against him, is responsible for the attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. He asserted that a "real president" should warn countries that if they attack a former U.S. president, they "will bomb that country into Oblivion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Views on U.S. Global Standing
Trump believes the U.S. is currently a "nation in decline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. He highlighted the issue of other countries going off the dollar as a concern for the U.S. monetary base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>. He aims to make the country "so great" again that its standing is unquestionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:39">[01:26:39]</a>. This aligns with his overarching legacy goal of "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>, a phrase he calls the "greatest movement political movement in the history of our country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>, and relates to [[the_future_of_american_politics_and_society_under_trump]].

## Early Aspirations and Path to Stardom

[[Logan Paul]] always knew he wanted to be an entertainer, even starting to make YouTube videos at nine years old with his brother [[Logan Pauls views on Jake Pauls career and their relationship | Jake Paul]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:53">[01:33:53]</a>. His early YouTube videos, made before puberty and around the "First Years of YouTube," were considered "golden" but were later deleted by him due to embarrassment and a desire to impress a girl in middle school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:59">[01:33:59]</a>. He pursued engineering in college but ultimately wanted to be an actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.

## WWE Ventures

Logan Paul has found a natural fit in WWE, citing his showmanship, acrobatics, and athleticism as key strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:37">[01:55:37]</a>. He trained for only two days for his WWE debut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:45">[01:55:45]</a>. He noted that people's reactions to his WWE performances, where they were "humbled by their own thoughts" and "reluctant to give props," indicated he was "pretty good at this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:08">[01:55:08]</a>. He feels that WWE is a sensible path for him, as it comes naturally and is broadly entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:48">[01:54:48]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Pursuits

Logan Paul identifies himself as smart and strategic in his business moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:16">[01:46:16]</a>. He believes his work ethic compensates for any perceived lack of talent in traditional entertainment fields like singing or acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06">[01:44:06]</a>.

### Prime Hydration
Prime Hydration, a venture with his former rival [[Logan Pauls rivalry and reconciliation with KSI | KSI]], is a significant part of Logan Paul's current entrepreneurial focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:34">[02:36:34]</a>. He states that Prime is a "mass" appeal product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:22">[01:49:22]</a>. He sees his partnership with KSI as an "incredible business move with an incredible story," aiming for Prime to become a mainstream hydration drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:20">[02:39:20]</a>. He hopes to one day say that while KSI saved his career, he "made him a billionaire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:50">[02:36:50]</a>. Walmart is a distribution partner for Prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:48">[02:15:48]</a>.

### 99 Originals and NFTs
Logan Paul's "99 Originals" project is described as more niche, appealing to those who appreciate art, stories, NFTs, and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:26">[01:49:26]</a>. He noted that his engagement on his page has decreased since releasing this type of content, as it "only resonates with a certain type of person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:20">[01:54:20]</a>. He still prioritizes his taste and opinion on what makes a good story over analytics when deciding what to publish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:03">[01:51:03]</a>. He went around the world for 99 days with a Polaroid camera to capture content for this project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:39">[01:56:39]</a>.

### Content Creation and Brand
Logan Paul sees his online presence as a "brand" and constantly gauges "the culture's feeling" about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:30">[01:48:30]</a>. He acknowledges that his "real life Logan isn't always the same as online Logan," as he often amplifies certain parts of his personality for performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:41">[01:48:41]</a>. He started daily vlogging when mid-roll ads on YouTube did not exist, believing he could have made significantly more money if they had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. He considers "fighting" a "cheat code" for attention, noting that the most extreme versions of entertainment (like fighting) capture universal interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Reflections on Fame

Logan Paul believes an era of authenticity is approaching where being oneself will "reign supreme" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. He feels that being 100% himself is a blessing, whether people like or hate him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. He observes that many celebrities "have to fake every single thing" and are often not enjoyable in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. He noted that the public perception of fame is shifting, with influencers and YouTubers gaining more recognition and financial power compared to traditional actors and singers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

### Impact of Controversy
Logan Paul attributes a significant part of his personal growth to his past "big cancellation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>. He believes that without these humbling experiences, he "would only know success" and feel "justified in their success" without acknowledging luck or good fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:34">[01:38:34]</a>.

### Humility and Perspective
Despite his achievements, Logan Paul has maintained a grounded perspective, stating he has "not a single win in my boxing record" and has been "humbled again and again and again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:13">[01:38:13]</a>. He describes himself as "fairly numb to success and failure," meaning he isn't overly affected by highs or lows, but remains "in love with the process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>. This detachment from outcome allows him to pursue what he loves, knowing that even if he doesn't achieve a specific goal, he will have learned from the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:52">[01:59:52]</a>.

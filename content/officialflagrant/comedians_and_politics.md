The discussion explores the hypothetical scenario of a comedian running for president in the United States, drawing parallels to Volodymyr Zelenskyy's successful political career in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The idea centers around Andrew Schulz as a potential candidate, highlighting his comedic approach to political issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Andrew Schulz for President: A Comedic Platform

Andrew Schulz performs a mock presidential announcement, offering satirical stances on various political issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. His proposed platform includes:

*   **Climate Change**
    *   Replacing Greta Thunberg with the girls from *Euphoria* to make "sea levels won't be the only thing rising six inches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Russia/Ukraine Conflict**
    *   Suggesting sending Machine Gun Kelly instead of machine guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Economy**
    *   Solving inflation by hiring "cheaper labor," specifically "women" instead of "illegal immigrants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Abortion**
    *   Mandatory abortions performed only by licensed NRA members, who "know how to get one out of the chamber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Citizenship**
    *   Asserting his American birth, even if his nose "looks like it was designed to exhale hookah" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Critical Race Theory**
    *   Proposing that Chris Rock teach it, noting "there's two sides, it's Black people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Illegal Immigration**
    *   Suggesting "t-shirt contests in the Rio Grande" and accepting only "the best of the breasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

The mock campaign slogan is "Andrew Schulz, the liar you can trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, a commentary on the nature of [[political_commentary_in_comedy | political discourse]] today.

### Cabinet and Political Strategy
The discussion extends to forming a comedic cabinet, with various team members assigned roles such as Vice President, Head of Security, and Secretary of Treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. They even discuss creating a political action group called "Hindus for Schulz for a greater America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

A key aspect of Schulz's "political" ambition is the desire to reach the debates, but not actually become president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, or perhaps become a "dictator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> for life, going "full Putin" to "get rid of these Nazis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. He believes he "could beat Trump" in a humorous way, contrasting his comedic background with Trump's perceived funniness as a non-comic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Further policy proposals include:
*   Lowering gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   Supporting trans equality based on watching *Euphoria* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   Accepting refugees if they can "find a way" to arrive, particularly by boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   Addressing racism by making things that endanger black people illegal, starting with fried chicken and sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, and later suggesting limiting voting rights to those who vote for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   Rejecting "universal healthcare" on the grounds that Americans shouldn't pay for the entire "universe," but supporting "American healthcare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

The campaign strategy humorously involves offering "stimulus" money via QR codes to win "minds and hearts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Comedians and Controversy: Will Smith and Chris Rock

The hosts discuss Tony Rock's reaction, supporting Chris Rock's decision to not immediately address the incident on stage to allow for a well-crafted response for a future special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. The discussion also touches on the shift in public sentiment towards Will Smith and how it affects his career and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

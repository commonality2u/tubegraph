Donald Trump has articulated his stance on [[abortion_rights_and_discussions | abortion rights]] and the reversal of Roe v. Wade, emphasizing that the issue should be decided at the state level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.

## Reversal of Roe v. Wade
Trump stated that the objective of overturning Roe v. Wade was always to return the authority over abortion laws to individual states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. He indicated that the legal scholars, regardless of their political alignment, did not believe that the federal government should have jurisdiction over this matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>. Following the Supreme Court's decision, states are now able to vote on and approve their own regulations concerning abortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. He noted that even states he won by a significant margin, like Ohio, have voted on the issue, indicating that it is now "up to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.

## Stance on Exceptions
Trump affirms his belief in exceptions for abortion, specifically in cases involving the life of the mother, rape, and incest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>. He stressed that individuals should not be forced to carry a pregnancy to term if it resulted from a violent crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. He indicated that his position on exceptions aligns with that of Ronald Reagan, who also supported these three protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. He suggested that the group of people who oppose these exceptions is shrinking as they "realize what's going on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>. Trump also stated he would not support state laws that do not include exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>.

## Support for IVF
Trump has been vocal in his support for In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). He recalled a situation in Alabama where a judge's ruling threatened to shut down IVF clinics across the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:29">[01:09:29]</a>. After a conversation with Senator Katie Britt, who explained the distress among women due to the ruling, Trump quickly came out strongly in favor of IVF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. He stated that IVF is a "great thing" that helps women have babies, and he believes in supporting policies that encourage having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. He noted that his swift action saved some Republican politicians from negative repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Political Impact
Trump acknowledged that the [[impact_of_the_trump_interview_on_public_perception | reversal of Roe v. Wade]] was a "very, very tough" issue that could cause Republicans to lose elections if not handled carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>. He highlighted the importance of moving the issue back to the states, which he believes was the long-standing desire across political spectrums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>. He argues that by returning the decision to the people through state votes, the "52-year ordeal" will largely be "quelled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.

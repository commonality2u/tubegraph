Logan Paul has shared his perspectives on a variety of influential figures and the broader landscape of fame and authenticity in the entertainment industry.

## On Combat Sports Personalities

### Floyd Mayweather
Logan Paul accuses [[Logan Pauls allegations against Floyd Mayweather | Floyd Mayweather]] of not paying him for their fight, claiming Mayweather owes him "millions," likely over $2 million but under $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. He states that Mayweather is being sued in New York for taking cash under the table for ticketing and selling rights without giving Logan his percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Paul suggests that Mayweather is "on his way" to being broke if he doesn't continue exhibition fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. He describes Mayweather as not hitting hard and being slow during their fight, even claiming to have popped Mayweather's eardrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a> and landed an overhand right that hurt him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

### Conor McGregor
Paul refers to [[Logan Pauls commentary on Conor McGregor and his challenges | Conor McGregor]] as someone whose "punches are softer than the pillow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

### Dillon Danis
Paul criticizes [[Dillon Danis discusses the Logan Paul fight preparation | Dillon Danis]]'s appearance, saying he looks "like a diabetic Count Chocula" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. He points out that Danis hasn't fought in three years and has "more cage time" on Sarah McLachlan commercials than actual fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. Paul acknowledges Danis as "one of the best Jiu-Jitsu guys in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, but also mentioned an incident where one of Danis's friends pulled a gun on Logan's friend Mike at a party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

### Jake Paul
Logan praises his brother [[Jake Pauls Thoughts on Boxing as a Sport | Jake Paul]] for supporting him after the Mayweather fight, saying, "eight rounds to nothing, Logan, you just beat the greatest fight of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. While Logan admits Jake was "being a little delusional" about the fight outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, he appreciates the confidence. Logan believes Jake is a "genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a> and allows him to be the primary boxer because Logan fears the long-term brain damage that boxing might inflict on himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. He also notes that people often confuse him and Jake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Logan reveals that his most viewed YouTube video is a diss track against Jake during a period of "real beef" between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, sparked by pranks such as Jake pretending to give Logan a Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### KSI
Paul considers [[KSIs thoughts on Jake Paul | KSI]] to have "saved his career" by calling him out for a boxing match, which provided Logan with a chance for "potential redemption" and to "earn respect in a different way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. He expresses gratitude for the opportunity to box twice and show his true character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Their past beef was "real," and after their second fight, Logan felt their similarities were undeniable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Paul later brought KSI an opportunity with Prime Hydration, hoping to make him a billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## On Musicians and Actors

Logan Paul describes Drake as an "incredible human being" who is "so kind" and "genuine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. He believes Drake gives love to others in the grind because he understands what it takes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

### Liam Payne
After having him on his podcast, Logan notes that Liam Payne, from One Direction, is "very talented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, capable of impersonations, singing, and freestyling. He also mentioned that Payne claimed to be the "founding father" of One Direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

### Harry Styles
Harry Styles is cited as an example of a "star" who possesses the "trifecta": talent, look, and name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

### Jared Leto
Logan met Jared Leto at Coachella and describes him as "nice" and a "good guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, noting that he didn't meet "The Joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### Tim Robinson
Logan highly recommends Tim Robinson's Netflix sketch comedy show "I Think You Should Leave," calling it "next up" and "really funny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## On Fame and Authenticity

Logan Paul believes that the political sphere is "muddied" and that people are "sick of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. He optimistically foresees an "era of authenticity" reigning supreme, where being "100% myself" is a blessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. He distinguishes himself from 95% of celebrities who "fake every single thing," arguing that audiences only know actors and singers by their characters or music, not their true selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

Paul asserts that the public's perception of fame is "going to completely shift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a> as influencers and YouTubers become involved in "legit billion dollar companies" and earn more than traditional actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. He notes that the value of the "influencer" and "online entrepreneur" is becoming "more and more recognizable and real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

Logan Paul acknowledges that some individuals are drastically changed by fame, often activating "not so favorable" parts of their ego, especially if they crave validity due to childhood trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. However, he believes there are "more good ones than not," estimating an 80/20 split of positive to negative experiences with famous people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. He credits his own "big cancellation" with partially grounding him and preventing him from feeling "justified in their success" without acknowledging luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

He reflects that his "work ethic makes up for my lack of talent" in many areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a> and that his "storytelling taste" is what determines what content he publishes, rather than analytics or views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

Paul sees content creation as a "natural form of like any endeavor," with "waves," "crest and tross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. He loves "capturing" moments and believes he will "forever be capturing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

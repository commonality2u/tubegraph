Discussion around recent train derailments in the United States has led to the emergence of [[Conspiracy theories and their impact | conspiracy theories]] concerning their cause and implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:53">[01:34:53]</a>.

## Unexplained Derailments
A key point of concern revolves around the rarity of train crashes, with one speaker asserting that "there's no reason for that" given that a train only operates on "one road" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>. The occurrence of "three train crashes in America" in a short period is considered unusual, as trains should ideally "never be a train crash ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24">[01:35:24]</a>.

The possibility of mechanical failure, such as a "bolt comes loose" on a wheel, is quickly dismissed due to the perceived robustness of train wheels compared to car tires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>.

## Poisonous Cargo and External Interference
A central element of the theory is the "peculiar" fact that "all three of the trains got poisonous" materials on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:35">[01:36:35]</a>. This raises questions about the commonality of hazardous cargo on trains in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a>.

Some speculate these incidents might be a "terrorist attack" that the government is unwilling to acknowledge, possibly related to foreign entities like "China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>. The idea that America is "just a poison factory" due to the large-scale transfer of chemicals is also discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:58">[01:38:58]</a>.

It's noted that 2.2 million carloads of chemicals were transported by freight trains in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:04">[01:44:04]</a>, and that incidents like the East Palestine derailment involved hazardous chemicals such as vinyl chloride, which becomes dangerous when it catches fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:23">[01:44:23]</a>.

## Frequency of Derailments
The discussion questions whether the public is aware of the true frequency of train incidents, suggesting that there are "1700 train derailments a year" which are not widely reported, especially if they don't involve hazardous materials or catch fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>. This leads to the idea that the public is only informed of specific crashes when they involve "poisonous" substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

The belief that the government might be "hiding the search" for information regarding these incidents also contributes to the [[Conspiracy theories and their role in modern discourse | conspiratorial mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:39">[01:43:39]</a>. There is a distinction between passenger and freight lines, though it is stated that all trains run on the same tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:37">[01:45:37]</a>.

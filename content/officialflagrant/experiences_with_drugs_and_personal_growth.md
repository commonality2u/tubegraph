The speaker recounts various personal [[use_and_effects_of_drugs_like_adderall_and_cocaine | experiences with drugs]], reflecting on their effects and how they have impacted his perspective and personal growth. He notes a shift in his relationship with substances, particularly alcohol, due to self-awareness of behavioral changes.

## Early Encounters with Drugs

The speaker recalls early encounters with drugs, even in academic settings. He used to pass around a "20 sack" with a friend in high school at 14 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. He also remembers doing cocaine in class with a homegirl, noting she would pull her nail out to snort it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:41">[02:23:41]</a>.

## Specific Drug Experiences and Effects

### Cocaine

The speaker describes his first experience with cocaine, which he discovered through friends who drank all night and stayed awake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. He recalled punching himself during his first time on cocaine because he "tweaked" and was his "own worst enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:30">[01:58:30]</a>. He also recounts a time when he was fishing while high on cocaine, claiming he was "full on focused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

One particularly vivid memory involved a near-fatal overdose. After taking one last bump of cocaine, he blacked out and woke up on the floor, feeling like "nobody can help me" and tripping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. He eventually made his way home, smoked with his grandpa, and went to bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### Perks (Percocet)

The speaker shares a brief experience with Percocet, which he took for dental reasons after a tooth removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>. He described feeling "warm and fuzzy and amazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.

### Ecstasy and Shrooms

He recalls a period where he was using cocaine, ecstasy, and shrooms simultaneously, describing his body not knowing how to feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. He specifically remembers blue dolphin-shaped ecstasy pills that "hit the hardest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:09">[02:05:09]</a>.

His introduction to [[experiences_with_psychedelics_and_perceptions_of_reality | shrooms]] came from a girl who "slutted" him out and "threw [him] on the shrooms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>. On shrooms, he felt "disconnected" and "everything was out to get me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:18">[02:22:18]</a>.

## Reflections on Drug Use and Personal Growth

The speaker has chosen to avoid alcohol because he recognizes that he acts "mean" and "confrontational" while on it, unlike drugs where he is "happy" and "friendly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

His [[experiences_with_psychedelics_and_perceptions_of_reality | experiences with psychedelics]] like shrooms, while initially making him feel disconnected, may have inadvertently contributed to his personal growth. He notes that he used to be very angry, a result of feeling "robbed from everything" due to a difficult childhood and his mother's death at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:55">[02:22:55]</a>. This anger would leave him feeling "whooped" and "drained" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. He believes he realized how unhealthy this anger was and stopped bottling it up, leading to a calmer demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

He reflects that he began to believe in himself around age 20 or 21, after having "everybody fuck on you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. He started making music because he "ain't have no job" and was "on drugs" and "didn't want to do nothing" else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>.

## Family's Influence and Drug Dealing

The speaker's mother and her partner were involved in [[impact_of_drug_dealing_on_personal_life | drug dealing]], specifically crack cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. He saw "a lot of fucked up shit," including his mother confronting someone about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. He recounts a story where his mother hit his cousin Homer in the head with a "brick of cocaine" because she was irritated in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This upbringing, combined with the harsh realities of his hometown of Bay City, where women were subjected to violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>, shaped his perception of the world.# Experiences with Drugs and Personal Growth

The concept of a "cowboy" extends beyond simply riding horses for That Mexican OT, encompassing a lifestyle, mentality, and deep connection to the land and community in Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.

## Cowboy Lifestyle

### Guns and Personal Safety
For That Mexican OT, owning and carrying firearms is a fundamental aspect of his Texan identity and personal safety. He considers his gun more essential than his wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, including it as part of his daily checklist alongside his wallet and cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. He even carries a gun in church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, attributing this to the realities of life in Texas, citing an instance in Chi-Raq where a casket was stolen from a funeral by opposition members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

He typically drives with multiple firearms, including "two AR and the passenger see AR on the back seat" and a pistol on his left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. He feels a dependence on his gun for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, stating that when he's without it, he questions what's happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. In contrast, he feels everyone in California is "out to get me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, leading him to overthink and stress there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

He has pulled out an AR-15 during situations where individuals "just needs some act right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, particularly at land parties where people on drugs might act erratically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He possesses large firearms with significant capacity, describing one as having a "titty on that muff titties" and "bullet drums all the bullets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. The sheer sight of these weapons can deter confrontations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### Ranch Life and Hunting
Life in Texas involves deep connections to the land, including hosting "land parties" on acres of fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. A notable activity is pig hunting, which can be done from a helicopter or the bed of a truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. Pigs are considered a nuisance by the government due to their destructive nature to land and crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>, allowing people to kill them freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Sometimes, the hunted pigs are cooked, while other times they are left for other animals as part of the life cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.

Texas, particularly the Gulf of Mexico region, is also "infested with gators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a> due to rivers flowing into the Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. Alligators can be found on golf courses in places like Bay City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

### Family Influence and Cowboy Mentality
That Mexican OT's upbringing in Texas instilled a "cowboy" mentality. His great-grandfather, Chico, was a "black cowboy of the century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>, known for his work on ranches, managing cattle, trimming nails, and breaking horses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>. Chico, who passed away at 99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:39">[01:41:39]</a>, was a certified and highly respected figure in Markham, Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:26">[01:42:26]</a>. This lineage influences That Mexican OT's desire to incorporate cowboy elements into his public image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>.

He learned to ride horses and views cowboying as a "whole lifestyle" and a "mentality" rather than just riding a horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.

## Future Aspirations

### Personal Goals
That Mexican OT aims for a future where he can relax, specifically mentioning having "two acres a double wide trailer yeah and then you said this in a trampoline bro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. At 50, he envisions himself "smoking on Viagra on my front porch" and "chilling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:52">[01:32:52]</a>. He also expresses a desire to have a large family, wanting "a whole football team" of kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:49">[01:43:49]</a>, driven by a wish to give his children the childhood he feels he missed out on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. He plans to start having children soon, even without a girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:17">[01:44:17]</a>, although he currently has a girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:27">[01:44:27]</a>. He also doesn't think he wants to get married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>.

A major financial goal is to "get the land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a>, which is why he avoids flashy jewelry and maintains a humble appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>. He prefers his cowboy hat and boots to be his "chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:39">[01:33:39]</a>.

### Music Career
Despite his success, That Mexican OT remains grounded. He recognizes the difference between gaining views and selling out shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>, valuing the organic growth of his fanbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>. He considers Russ an inspiration for his career approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:72">[01:27:72]</a>, admiring how Russ released a song a week, forcing consistent improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a>.

He wishes to perform at a rodeo, walking out singing "Troubadour" while playing an acoustic guitar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">[02:02:05]</a>. He sees himself "unlocking new characters every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a> in his music, evolving beyond just rap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. He embraces genre diversity, including country songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:21">[01:26:21]</a>.

That Mexican OT maintains a strong belief in his own ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a>, asserting, "if I don't believe myself why the fuck should you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>. This self-confidence, combined with his unique style, has contributed to his rapid success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. He believes that by leaning into his authentic self, success naturally follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:57">[01:56:57]</a>.

His current girlfriend is "figuring it out" as his newfound fame means he's not home all the time, and more people want his attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:37">[01:44:37]</a>. He acknowledges the difficulty for partners during this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:02">[01:45:02]</a>. This period of rapid success also comes with challenges, such as family and acquaintances asking for money, which frustrates him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>. He feels it's important to experience this journey now, for the sake of his future family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:55">[01:45:55]</a>.

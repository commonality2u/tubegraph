Dana White, a known enthusiast for combat sports and entrepreneurship, also has a prominent and aggressive approach to high-stakes gambling, particularly in Las Vegas casinos. He views his gambling endeavors as a personal "war" against the largest casino companies, thriving on the challenge and the thrill of going "toe-to-toe" with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

### Approach to Gambling

White primarily plays Baccarat, describing it as "50/50" and the "closest statistical game" in a casino, allowing for higher stakes than games like Blackjack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:10">[01:55:10]</a>. He aims to "clip" casinos for a set amount per night, usually around $800,000 to $1 million, and if he wins that amount, he leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:37">[01:53:37]</a>. His strategy involves playing "three hands and you're out" if he hits his winning target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:50">[01:55:50]</a>. However, when he is losing, he is prepared to "go guns of blazing" and use his entire credit line, which is $6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>.

### Specific Experiences and Runs

White boasts about his recent performance against Caesars Palace, stating he beat them for $16.5 million since January 1st of the current year, only losing twice in that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:02">[01:49:02]</a>. Despite the potential for large losses, he manages the emotional highs and lows of gambling, viewing each session as a "battle" within a larger "war" for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:41">[01:52:41]</a>. He has shared videos showing him walking out with over a million dollars in cash after winning sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:29">[01:57:29]</a>.

He attributes his consistent play to diligence, although he admits there have been a "couple times" he's gone "on tilt" and lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:36">[01:39:36]</a>. He once lost $300,000 at a casino in Niagara Falls that denied him further credit, which he described as a "shitty, dirty business" compared to Vegas casinos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:57">[01:58:57]</a>. In contrast, Las Vegas casinos, particularly Caesars, are praised for their customer service for high rollers, even building a custom room for him to play Baccarat, complete with a TV and gaming chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>. These casinos also offer perks like annual shopping events using accumulated points, which White uses to buy gifts for his employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:22">[01:48:22]</a>.

White previously beat The Palms casino for $1.6 million over 23 consecutive trips playing Blackjack, leading them to reduce his betting limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:43">[02:01:43]</a>. He emphasizes that casinos don't "ban" big players for winning, but rather adjust limits to make it harder to win consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:37">[02:02:37]</a>.

### Superstitions and Vibes

White's gambling is also influenced by personal superstitions and "vibes." He prefers to play in casinos where he feels a good energy and where dealers want him to win, as he takes care of them with tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:55">[02:06:55]</a>. He finds Chinese Baccarat players to have "good gambling vibes" due to their energetic and superstitious nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:40">[01:47:40]</a>. Conversely, he avoids "shitty" dealers with bad attitudes, or "Eddie Mushes," whom he perceives as having bad luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:15">[02:06:15]</a>.

He also notes that celebrities like Charles Barkley and Aiden Ross are serious high-stakes gamblers, with Barkley once winning $650,000 during a [[Power Slap | Power Slap]] weekend gambling party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:46">[02:03:46]</a>.

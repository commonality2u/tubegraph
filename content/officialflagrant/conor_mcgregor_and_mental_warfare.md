Conor McGregor is recognized for his exceptional abilities in mental warfare within combat sports, often drawing comparisons to legendary figures like Muhammad Ali [00:09:51]. This aspect of his persona has been a significant factor throughout his career.

## Mental Warfare Tactics
[[Conor McGregors Fighting Career and Media Presence | Conor McGregor]] is noted for his skill in psychological battles before fights, using tactics such as predicting rounds [01:10:31] and engaging in various forms of mental manipulation against his opponents [01:10:43]. This approach often makes fighters like Jos√© Aldo want to "tear his head off" due to the intense psychological pressure McGregor applies [01:10:37]. He aims to get into opponents' heads, embarrass them, and outwit them in every way [01:10:46].

For example, leading up to the Eddie Alvarez fight at Madison Square Garden, McGregor was described as being "literally at Ali's level when it came to mental warfare" [01:10:59].

## Public Persona and Strategy
Even videos of [[Conor McGregors allegations and professional behavior | Conor McGregor]] partying before a fight are questioned as potential marketing or part of his mental warfare strategy [01:09:05], leading to discussions about whether it's genuine behavior or a controlled leak to affect opponents [01:09:18]. His ability to build a powerful personality, similar to [[Sean OMalleys fighting career and insights | Sugar Sean O'Malley]] or Ronda Rousey, is seen as a "home run" for the sport, though ultimate success in fighting depends on being a formidable opponent rather than just personality [01:08:48].

UFC management, while acknowledging McGregor's personal choices, primarily focuses on the fighter's ability to perform. When fighters like McGregor and Jon Jones are at a point in their careers where their legacy is established and they've earned significant money, their fights become more about entertainment, making it "fun when they show up and fight" [01:11:27].

Senator Bernie Sanders contends that the American system is fundamentally "built to screw you over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, rather than being merely broken. He asserts that this conviction stems from observing that powerful entities prioritize profit over community well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. A formative experience for Sanders was the 1958 relocation of the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles by Walter O'Malley, which he describes as driven by "corporate greed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This event broke a "young Brooklyn boy's heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a> and significantly impacted his political views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, as the Dodgers were a "cohesive force in Brooklyn bringing people together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. He highlights that this pattern continues today, with professional sports teams owned by billionaires moving based on financial incentives, regardless of the emotional impact on communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Current State of Wealth and Inequality

Despite being the "richest country in the history of the world" with "enormous wealth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>, this wealth does not apply to the vast majority of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. Sanders states that 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>, experiencing "enormous stress" over basic needs like rent, healthcare, and car repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the concentration of wealth at the top.

> "How many people will talk about the reality that [[impact_of_billionaires_like_elon_musk_and_mark_zuckerberg_on_society | Elon Musk]] himself owns more wealth than the bottom 52% of American households?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>
> – Senator Bernie Sanders

Sanders suggests there is a "new breed of uber capitalists" who believe they are "superior human beings" and that "to the victor go the spoils" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>. He notes that some ultra-wealthy individuals decide to give away "some of their money" upon their death, which could be interpreted as an "admission that they agree" that it's "kind of wrong" to keep all that wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.

### Economic Realities:
*   Over the last 52 years, despite an "explosion in technology" and increased worker productivity, real inflation-accounted wages have increased by "0% zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>.
*   The Rand Corporation, "not a socialist organization," found a "massive transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%" during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>.
*   This leads to a tough reality where the "average worker out there" sees the top getting "phenomenally rich" while they are "no better off," and their kids are likely to be "worse off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>.

## How Billionaires Influence Politics

[[the_impact_of_money_and_lobbying_on_political_decisions | The influence of money in politics]] is deeply ingrained through a "broken and corrupt campaign finance system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>.

### Citizens United and Super PACs
The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, made "15, 20 years" prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>, ruled that advertising is a form of "freedom of speech" and thus, wealthy individuals can spend "unlimited sums of money" on political ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>. This decision led to the proliferation of "super PACs," organizations that can receive "as much money as they want" from billionaires to run political ads and engage in "political stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>.

For instance, [[impact_of_billionaires_like_elon_musk_and_mark_zuckerberg_on_society | Elon Musk]] "spent $270 million to help [[donald_trumps_influence_in_global_politics | Donald Trump]] get elected president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>. Both Democrats and Republicans have billionaires contributing to Super PACs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:00">[22:44:00]</a>. This financial leverage is "enormously effective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>, especially when combined with a figure like [[donald_trumps_influence_in_global_politics | Donald Trump]] who is "enormously popular within the Republican base" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. It makes it "very hard for any Republican to sustain to stand up and and authentically speak their mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a> against the interests of these powerful donors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>.

### Lobbying and Political Pressure
Special interest groups, such as APEC, "funded by billionaires" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>, wield significant influence. When Sanders introduced legislation to block military aid to Netanyahu's government due to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, he gained "15 Democrats" but "zero Republicans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:00">[26:41:00]</a>. He suggests that many Democrats did not support him because they "will have to take on APEC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.

> "If you want to speak out against Netanyahu's government and oppose military sales, APEC, which is also funded by billionaires who support both Democrats, Republicans, will go after." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>

These groups don't typically talk about the specific issue but instead make the politician "so radioactive" with "negative advertising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>, often without mentioning the actual point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:59:00">[27:59:00]</a>. Sanders and the host agree that this tactic is "duplicitous" and "undermining the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>.

The pharmaceutical industry, for example, made "$100 billion" in profit last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>, and drug companies charge "five, eight times more expensive" prices in the US than in Canada or Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. This is partly due to the presence of "1,500" paid lobbyists from drug companies in Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>. Lobbyists, often "former leaders of the Republican and Democratic party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>, leverage "money, connections, friendship" and even "ability to write tough legislation" to influence policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

### Party Dynamics and the Democratic Establishment
The Democratic party, since the 1970s and 1980s, learned that "you could raise a lot of money from wealthy people," leading to a "Democratic establishment now which is funded by wealthy people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:00">[40:11:00]</a>. This has resulted in consultants who are "way out of touch with reality" and the "working class is ignored" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:30:00">[40:30:00]</a>. Sanders suggests that this detachment, including the refusal to acknowledge that the system is broken, leads to voters feeling ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:33:00">[39:33:00]</a>.

## The Broader Impact and Potential Solutions

The concentration of ownership is also a concern, with three Wall Street investment firms—BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—being "major stockholders in 95% of the corporations in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:28:00">[57:28:00]</a>. This gives these three entities "enormous power" over corporate decisions, including where companies operate, worker wages, and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:54:00">[57:54:00]</a>.

Sanders advocates for fundamental changes to address these issues. He believes that the US has "enough money in this country to do any goddamn thing you want to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>, pointing to massive tax breaks for the wealthy and high military spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

### Education and Healthcare
*   **Education:** Sanders advocates for education to be a "lifelong pursuit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a> and believes that higher education, especially for professions like doctors, nurses, and engineers, should be "tuition free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. This would incentivize young people to pursue critical fields without the burden of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. He contrasts the US system with countries like Finland where teachers are highly respected and well-paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** He emphasizes that the US is the "one major country" that does not guarantee healthcare as a human right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:38]</a>, despite spending "twice as much per person on healthcare as most of the European countries" that do provide universal healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>. He points to the profit motive of insurance and drug companies as a primary reason for high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

### Resisting the Oligarchy
Sanders is working to counter the influence of the "oligarchs and the ruling class" who "want you to believe that you're powerless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>. He encourages people to get involved, form unions, and participate in education, as "we need more participation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>. He believes that people across America, regardless of background, want "a different America" that is not based on "greed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>. He sees a movement building to "stand up to this oligarchy" and to "authoritarianism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.

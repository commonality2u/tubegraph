Israel Adesanya, a prominent figure in the UFC, frequently discusses the critical role of mentality and unique visualization techniques in his career, both in victory and defeat.

## The Power of Visualization
Adesanya emphasizes that visualization is a core component of his preparation, often occurring in unexpected moments, such as in the shower, which he considers "the most honest place in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. He visualizes every aspect of a fight, from the win and knockout to post-fight press conferences and fight week activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This process is automatic, almost like "Tourette's," and serves as his method of manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

During these visualizations, he experiences intense happiness, desiring for everyone to feel that same joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This feeling, sometimes enhanced by substances like mushrooms, allows him to enter a "flow state" where words and actions effortlessly come to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

A potent example of his visualization at work was after his knockout victory over Pereira. He recalled the moment of extending his hand towards Pereira's son as "payback," a moment he had visualized many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. He was hyper-aware in the cage, knowing where everyone, including Pereira's family, was located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This act was a response, not a reaction, stemming from taking the son's prior in-ring taunt "personally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Six weeks prior to that fight, he explicitly wrote on his mirror: "April 8th Miami 2023, the greatest comeback in sporting history. It was written by me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:24">[02:00:24]</a>. This served as a constant affirmation, which he would also recite randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:44">[02:00:44]</a>.

## Mental Fortitude and Emotional Control
Adesanya’s mindset is defined by several principles:
*   **Response over Reaction**: He states, "I don't react, I respond. I take my time when I respond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Internal Validation**: He believes that "you're never as good as they say you are, you're never as bad as they say you are. All that matters is how you see yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:41">[02:22:41]</a>. He appreciates both love and hate, using them as fuel, but "never holds on to it," letting it pass through him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>.
*   **Protecting Energy**: During fight camp, he isolates himself and cuts out anything or anyone not in line with his fight preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:19">[02:23:19]</a>. He has learned to say "no" and not explain himself to protect his energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:43">[02:26:43]</a>. He likens public interaction to feeding a seagull – once you do, everyone wants a piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:55">[02:26:55]</a>.
*   **Embracing Adversity**: In a tough fight, he recalled his coach's words: "Embrace the darkness, go numb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:27">[02:52:27]</a>. This allowed him to reach a state of readiness to both "die" and "kill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:50">[02:52:50]</a>. He is grateful for opponents who push him past his limits, as it makes him a better fighter and athlete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:53">[02:55:53]</a>.

> "If I die here, I die here. But if I'm ready to die, I'm ready to kill." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:40">[02:52:40]</a>

## Self-Awareness and Personal Growth
His personal journey, highlighted in his documentary, reveals his past as a "people pleaser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:44">[02:43:44]</a>, a coping mechanism developed after moving to New Zealand to be accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:07">[02:44:07]</a>. Recognizing this trait allows him to pull back and protect his energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>.

Adesanya believes in being his authentic self. His advice to others struggling to do so is simple: "Do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:40">[03:38:40]</a>. He uses his social media to "weed out" those who don't truly understand or support him, stating there are "no rules to this internet shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:53">[03:53:53]</a>. This openness, even about losses, helps others embrace their own humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:28">[03:30:28]</a>. He notes that seeing someone else (like Kai) handle a loss well makes him "okay" too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:09">[03:37:09]</a>.

## Spirituality and Performance
Adesanya acknowledges that his use of mushrooms, specifically microdosing, helps him "tap into" his primal self, or "the dog in me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:27">[02:24:27]</a>. He believes the flow state, where various brain chemicals are released, is akin to spirituality or "magic we don't understand yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:32">[03:12:32]</a>. He finds inspiration in the movie *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, viewing its message of kindness in a harsh world as a "martial art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:09">[03:18:09]</a>.

He attributes his ability to [[Role of mentality and meditation in sports | ride the wave]] of crowd energy during a fight to his background in dancing and freestyling, allowing his body to instinctively link movements to the music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:51">[03:13:51]</a>.

Before his fight with Costa, he recounts having a nap before getting his hands wrapped, during which he felt like a "sleeper agent" who "tapped into something else," waking up in a different zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:47">[03:20:47]</a>. He also deliberately tapped into his Nigerian heritage and "royal family" roots, using a chief staff (UKa) at weigh-ins to connect with his culture, inspired by Pereira's connection to his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This spiritual grounding is a practice he intends to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:54">[03:11:54]</a>.

Adesanya is continually learning and evolving, seeing his career as a story he is still writing, both inside and outside the octagon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:24">[03:11:24]</a>.

Comedian Bobby Lee's career in both acting and stand-up comedy is a recurring topic among his peers, who frequently discuss his unique approach to performance and his personal journey in the entertainment industry.

## Acting Career

Bobby Lee has a self-proclaimed "weird fascination with old Hollywood" acting and securing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. Despite sometimes claiming he is "not a good actor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:16">[02:28:16]</a>, others compliment his abilities, especially his dramatic acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:44">[01:24:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>. He can perform a crying scene on cue if given a high-stakes scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.

His acting career has provided him with numerous opportunities:
*   He was on the sketch comedy show *Mad TV* early in his career, which was described as a "hit television show" just "five years into the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.
*   More recently, he plays a "Korean doctor" in the series *Reservation Dogs*, a role that peers acknowledge he is "very good" in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   He is also currently featured on *And Just Like That...*, where he portrays a podcast studio runner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>. This role is considered "true acting" as he pretends to be on time and run things, a departure from his real-life habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:15">[02:26:15]</a>.

Comparisons are sometimes made between Bobby Lee and [[andrew_santinos_comedy_and_impressions | Andrew Santino]] regarding their acting prowess, with some suggesting [[andrew_santinos_comedy_and_impressions | Santino]] might have "another gear" in dramatic roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.

## Comedy Style and Performance

Bobby Lee is known for his willingness to do "anything for the laugh" or "for the show," even if it means self-deprecating humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

A notable part of his past stand-up routine involved showing his penis on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. While he no longer performs this bit, he now does a "fake takeout" where he reveals only "half of my pubes" before pulling back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>. The act was described as "playful" and not threatening to the audience, often boosting their confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>. However, he has recounted instances where this bit led to him being "beat up twice" by audience members, with one instance resulting in him being "slammed on the ground" and another causing a bleeding injury from a nail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>. He no longer performs the full reveal in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.

Bobby Lee's unique brand of humor is linked to his personal history. His therapist suggested that his "weird sense of humor" developed as a "defense mechanism" due to significant trauma in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. He has channeled this into a successful career in comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:31">[02:07:31]</a>.

He, alongside [[andrew_santinos_comedy_and_impressions | Andrew Santino]], hosts the *Bad Friends* podcast, which is highly praised for its humor and dynamic. They plan a future "movie theater tour" that will combine stand-up with a live podcast, utilizing their "improv" and "impromptu" comedic abilities that make their live show effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:47">[01:30:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>.

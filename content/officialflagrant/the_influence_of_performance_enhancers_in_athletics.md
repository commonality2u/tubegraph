Performance enhancers, often referred to as performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), play a significant role in modern athletics, influencing everything from athlete recovery to competitive outcomes. The discussion around their use is complex, involving medical, ethical, and competitive dimensions.

## Types and Effects

Common performance enhancers include EPO (Erythropoietin), growth hormone, and testosterone, often referred to as "the big three" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. EPO, in particular, is considered the "king of performance enhancers" in fight sports, as it increases red blood cells, thereby boosting endurance and stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:13">[01:41:13]</a>.

The speaker notes that performance enhancers make athletes "bigger, stronger, faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">[01:40:12]</a>. A significant benefit is improved recovery, enabling athletes to train harder and more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>. Athletes might claim they only took substances to "train hard," but this is a self-compliment that highlights their dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>.

## Personal Experience and Perspective

The speaker, a former fighter, admits to having used performance enhancers during his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:57">[01:54:57]</a>. He views these substances as "medicine" designed to "make you better," asserting that all medicine aims to improve one's condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:59">[01:38:59]</a>. He maintains that the issue lies in abuse, not use, of these substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>.

During a commission hearing, when asked if he knew the substances would provide an advantage, the speaker responded that he "wouldn't have taken it if [he] didn't think [it would] give [him] an advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11">[01:39:11]</a>. He currently takes HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) to boost natural testosterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>, and is interested in exploring [[use_of_peptides_for_health_and_fitness | peptides]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:57">[01:41:57]</a>.

## Notable Cases and Controversies

High-profile athletes like [[celebrity_influence_and_public_perception | LeBron James]] and Tiger Woods are mentioned in connection to performance enhancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:16">[01:40:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. The speaker suggests that if other basketball players truly understood the benefits of EPO, they would recognize its impact on a player like LeBron James's endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a>.

Lance Armstrong is cited as a key example of an athlete who used EPO and growth hormone but never failed a drug test, only confessing his use to Oprah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:46">[01:40:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:41">[01:52:41]</a>. Armstrong achieved this by flushing his system with IVs, a method that USADA (U.S. Anti-Doping Agency) later tried to counteract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:49">[01:52:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:16">[01:53:16]</a>.

The recent controversy surrounding Islam Makhachev's alleged IV use is also discussed. The speaker notes that while Makhachev legally had the right to use an IV, the critical question is what substances and what milligrams were administered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:48">[01:49:48]</a>. He criticizes the nurse who reportedly leaked this information, calling it a "scumbag move" that violates patient confidentiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:33">[01:50:33]</a>. Despite the controversy, the speaker believes Makhachev was not in violation of any rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:27">[01:52:27]</a>.

## Regulation and Testing

The introduction of "out of competition testing," where testers show up unannounced, significantly changed the landscape of drug testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:41">[01:38:41]</a>. While athletes may be able to beat a drug test, the speaker believes it is more complicated than commonly thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>. Regarding IV use, the speaker argues that USADA's claims about detecting substances or specific amounts are largely a "bluff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:31">[01:53:31]</a>.

## Prevalence in Professional Sports

The speaker suggests that performance enhancer use is prevalent in [[nfl_and_athlete_personalities | NFL]] locker rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:23">[01:54:23]</a>, but believes it's very rare in basketball, citing LeBron James as one of the few he's aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:30">[01:54:30]</a>. In golf, he knows of only one athlete, Tiger Woods, who follows the "big three" regimen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:36">[01:54:36]</a>.

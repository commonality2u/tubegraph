The conversation around cartels and border security is heavily influenced by the [[Donald Trumps America | Trump administration's]] rhetoric and proposed policies. The topic touches upon national security, economic implications, and the social impact of immigration.

## Perceptions and Proposals
In the context of [[Donald Trumps America | Trump's America]], there's a strong emphasis on the severity of the cartel threat and the need for stringent border control. One speaker highlights Tom Homan's assertions that cartels are responsible for the rape of 31% of women who make the journey across the border, including children as young as nine [01:04:14]. It is further claimed that cartels have killed more Americans than every terrorist organization globally, leading to [[Donald Trump's influence in global politics | Donald Trump's]] commitment to designate them as terrorist organizations and employ U.S. Special Operations to eliminate them [01:04:29]. This approach signifies a willingness to engage in "war with the cartels" [01:04:44].

Regarding appointments for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a concern is raised about whether a governor from North Dakota, unfamiliar with active threats, would be suitable for such a role, emphasizing the need for someone with experience in thwarting terror attacks [01:01:31]. However, a counter-argument suggests that Cubans, like Marco Rubio, might be effective in security roles given their perceived ability to "lock that shit down so fast" [01:02:11].

## Policy and Impact
The financial and social costs of mass deportations are discussed, with an estimated cost of $88 billion to deport a million people annually [01:02:55]. The question arises whether this expense is justified for [[role_of_tariffs_and_policy_in_national_security_and_economic_stability | national security]] and if mass deportation can occur without family separation [01:03:37]. One speaker suggests that the initial deportation process should target criminals [01:04:00].

A controversial, humorous, and provocative viewpoint is presented that Americans "need" cocaine for confidence, and that without it, the "American Empire is over" [01:06:57]. This perspective suggests that if cartels are eliminated, the supply of cocaine—which has historically fueled "amazing ideas" in America, from the "BBL" to Wall Street innovation—would cease [01:05:54].

### El Salvador's Model
El Salvador's approach to gang violence is highlighted as a perceived success story. The country's president, Nayib Bukele, reportedly implemented a policy of immediately imprisoning anyone gang-related, leading to the country transitioning from one of the most dangerous to one of the safest "literally overnight" [01:53:57]. This policy, implemented under emergency martial law, involved the detention of 83,000 people and demonstrated that "if you punish criminals it makes life better" [01:54:17]. However, it is acknowledged that this infringes on freedoms that exist in America, such as *habeas corpus* [01:56:47].

## Broader Political Context
The discussion around cartels and border security takes place within a broader critique of America's political landscape, particularly the [[critiques_of_americas_political_and_cultural_divisions | political and cultural divisions]]. The perception of the Democratic Party is described as being dominated by "identity politics" and "leftists" who care only about "Fringe groups" rather than "working everyday American" concerns [01:13:51]. This perceived disconnect in the Democratic Party's messaging is seen as a factor contributing to its struggle to connect with the majority of people [01:13:08]. This perception is contrasted with the Republican Party's understanding of political "wrestling," allowing them to push their agenda more effectively [01:10:17].

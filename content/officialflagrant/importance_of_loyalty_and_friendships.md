Loyalty and [[friendship_and_mentorship | friendships]] are recurring themes, highlighted through personal anecdotes and observations on the nature of relationships in and out of the public eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. The importance of mutual support and trust is emphasized, especially during difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:39">[01:12:39]</a>.

## Unwavering Support

True loyalty is demonstrated when individuals stand by each other, even when it might lead to criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. This bond is valued above all else, especially when others might turn away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

It is noted that a professional fighter, when facing public backlash, was defended by a friend who had nothing to gain from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. This individual's unwavering support, despite potential personal criticism, was seen as a testament to their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. This loyalty is reciprocated, with the fighter stating they would "always had his back" and "never said one bad word about him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>.

Family loyalty is also a strong aspect. A sibling is described as someone who would "go to war" for him, even getting arrested together during a street fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

## Challenges to Trust and Loyalty

While some relationships demonstrate profound loyalty, others highlight the pain of betrayal. Success and fame can lead to isolation, with some friends turning on individuals for personal gain, like "getting clout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.

A deeply personal experience of betrayal involved a best friend since childhood who failed to offer support during a family tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>. The individual expresses that this friend's absence at a funeral, despite knowing the family, was "heartbreaking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>. This illustrates the profound impact of not receiving expected support during vulnerable times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>.

## Mentorship and Its Complexities

The relationship with a martial arts coach, Marcelo Garcia, who was "like my dad," demonstrates the complexities of [[friendship_and_mentorship | mentorship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. This coach instilled discipline but also publicly disciplined the fighter, which was seen as a breach of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>. Despite the admiration and deep connection, the public nature of the reprimand, especially through a 20-minute video, caused significant hurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. The individual feels that his coach "left me" during a difficult period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

## Collective Victory

In professional settings like martial arts, the concept of [[friendship_and_mentorship | friendship]] extends to training partners and team members. The success of a fighter is not their own; it belongs to "everybody" involved in their training and support system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">[01:46:50]</a>. This collective effort fosters a sense of camaraderie and shared triumph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:32">[01:46:32]</a>.

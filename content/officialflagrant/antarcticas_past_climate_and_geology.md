Antarctica is a continent that has intrigued researchers with its mysterious past. While currently covered by miles of ice, evidence suggests a dramatically different climate in deep history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

## Ancient Climate

There was undoubtedly a time when Antarctica was lush and green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It is likely that 90 million years ago, Antarctica hosted a lush rainforest, now buried under vast ice sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>. However, a key question remains: was Antarctica lush and green during the lifetime of the human species? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>

According to conventional evolutionary theory, the *Homo sapiens* lineage dates back about 6 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. At that time, 6 million years ago, Antarctica is generally believed to have been as cold and frozen as it is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. This contrasts with periods much further back, like 90 million years ago, when the Earth's climate was vastly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>.

## Geological Theories and Ancient Maps

The idea of Antarctica having a different past gained prominence through the work of researcher Charles Hapgood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>. In his book, *The Path of the Pole*, Hapgood proposed the theory of **Earth Crust Displacement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. This theory suggests that, from time to time, the entire outer crust of the Earth could shift, similar to the skin of a loose orange moving independently of its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>. If this phenomenon occurred, Antarctica could have originally been in warmer latitudes and later shifted into colder ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

The standard academic response to this theory is that Antarctica has been frozen for millions of years, thus ruling out the Earth crust displacement argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. However, some researchers, like Italian Admiral Flavio Barbiero, have suggested that such a displacement could be triggered by a comet impact, causing a glancing blow to the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

The presence of Antarctica on ancient maps further fuels these discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. Our civilization officially discovered Antarctica in 1820 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>. Yet, maps from much earlier periods, such as a 1520 map based on older sources, depict Antarctica (then known as Terra Australis, or the Southern Land) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

For instance, the Oronteus Finaeus map from 1531 shows Antarctica as a landmass, larger than it is today, with the tip of South America almost touching it, a configuration that would have existed during the last Ice Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>. The mapmaker claimed to expose regions previously "hidden in darkness," implying he copied information from ancient maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>. This suggests the possibility of a past civilization capable of exploring and mapping the Earth during the Ice Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

Some contemporary observations of Antarctica, such as reports of "eerily pointy and four-sided" mountains, continue to pique interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>. There is also a known international pact among countries with claims on Antarctica, prohibiting digging or mineral removal from the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.

While the Earth crust displacement theory has received criticism, attention has recently shifted to the scientifically supported [[connections_between_ancient_human_history_and_cataclysmic_events | Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis]] as a better explanation for a global cataclysm at the end of the Ice Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>. However, discussions about Antarctica's ancient past and potential pre-human history remain a significant part of [[possibility_of_ancient_civilizations | lost civilization]] theories.

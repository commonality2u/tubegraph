The release of the 1,000-page [[epstein_files_and_allegations | Epstein file]] on January 4, 2024, brought back public attention to the activities surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, including new names allegedly connected to his operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Among the individuals mentioned was renowned physicist Stephen Hawking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Allegations Involving Stephen Hawking

Stephen Hawking was rumored to have been involved in an underage orgy on [[experiences_and_perceptions_of_jeffrey_epstein | Epstein's Island]] during an academic conference in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The allegations, which were described as part of the "Epstein Island [[conspiracy_theories_and_their_impact | conspiracy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, claimed he "got a lap dance from a wrecking ball" and visited the island due to his alleged affinity for strip clubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Jeffrey Epstein reportedly attempted to pay people to discredit these rumors and cover up Hawking's involvement, even trying to "erase Steven's memory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### The "Midgets Doing Algebra" Rumor
A popular internet rumor circulated that Stephen Hawking watched naked midgets doing algebra problems on a chalkboard that was too high for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This specific scenario, however, was a "Twitter setup" and "not real at all" according to discussions of the files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Despite its fictitious nature, some found the idea amusing and even thought it made Hawking more "likable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The fabricated scenario was noted as "not illegal" on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Discussion of Hawking's Physical Limitations
Commentators questioned the feasibility of the serious allegations given Hawking's severe physical disabilities. It was argued that:
*   He communicated primarily through blinking and could not move his eyebrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   He could not physically "seduck" another woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   He "literally can't give consent" due to his condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   It was suggested he might have been a victim, "trafficked" and "rolled around the world from rape to rape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   The idea of him "rolling around in the sand" on the island, which was "not wheelchair accessible," was also brought up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Context of the Epstein Files
[!INFO] The released documents are court documents containing allegations, not necessarily proof that events transpired as described. They represent accusations made by individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Hawking's visit to the island for an academic conference occurred in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This was after Epstein had been accused of sex trafficking in 2005, though he was not convicted until 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Some argued that academics should have been more cautious, waiting for a verdict before visiting the island of someone facing such serious allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Conclusion Regarding Stephen Hawking
The overall sentiment from the discussion was that Stephen Hawking, who lived to be 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, deserves an apology, especially from those who spread the "silly" rumor about him watching midgets do math problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. His inclusion in the [[epstein_files_and_allegations | Epstein file]] was largely due to Epstein's alleged efforts to discredit existing rumors about Hawking, rather than direct accusations from victims within the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.

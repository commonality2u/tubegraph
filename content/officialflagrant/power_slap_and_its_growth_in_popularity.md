Power Slap, a combat sport featuring competitive striking, has seen a rapid and significant rise in popularity since its inception. In just 15 months, the sport has grown into a $750 million business that dominates social media with billions of views globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

## Origin and Concept
The concept for Power Slap was discovered by Dana White in 2018 while scrolling through Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. He encountered videos originating from Russia and Poland, which appeared to be filmed on rudimentary equipment, showing people slapping each other over a barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Despite the low production quality, one such video had accumulated 350 million views on YouTube, comparable to a Justin Bieber video at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. This observation sparked White's vision: to formalize this activity into an actual sanctioned sport with high production value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Unlike the [[ufc_and_mma_culture | UFC]], whose acquisition was a unique opportunity, Power Slap's intellectual property was created from scratch, building upon existing lower-level leagues in Poland and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. Dana White owns Power Slap with the Fertita brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:18">[01:37:18]</a>.

## Initial Reception and Challenges
The initial perception of Power Slap was often dismissive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. However, Dana White asserts that the [[evolution_of_ufc_and_impact_on_combat_sports | UFC]] faced even worse public and media reception in its early days, often deemed "gross" and "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. He loves negativity and uses it as extra motivation to prove skeptics wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:38">[01:44:38]</a>.

## Growth and Metrics
In just 15 months, Power Slap has achieved remarkable digital growth:
*   More YouTube subscribers than NHL, MLS, NASCAR, PGA, and [[rise_of_barstool_sports_and_its_influence | Barstool Sports]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>.
*   Over a billion YouTube views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.
*   Eight of the top 12 largest YouTube shorts against other major sports are Power Slap related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>.

*   More followers than every professional sports team in just 15 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.
*   Power Slap's reality show has accumulated 40 million views online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:46">[01:34:46]</a>.
*   It has more views than any Taylor Swift video ever posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

## Financial Success
Power Slap is already a $750 million business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. The sport currently has 27 sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:26">[01:32:26]</a>. With the introduction of real money into the sport, participants are taking it seriously, leading to athletes buying houses, cars, and boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a>.

## Global Reach and Accessibility
Power Slap has a massive presence in India, Southeast Asia, China, and Brazil (where knockoff leagues already exist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:56">[01:30:56]</a>. The sport's simplicity is a key factor in its global appeal:
*   "Everybody knows what's slapping someone in the face. It is the 100-meter dash of fight sports." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:31:37]</a>
*   Its clips are "fun, snackable content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:49">[01:31:49]</a>.
*   It taps into a universal understanding of being slapped or slapping someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:42">[01:31:42]</a>.
*   This contrasts with mixed martial arts, where some viewers might still be confused about ground fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>.

## Future Prospects and Evolution
Dana White sees the sport as being in its early stages, akin to the early days of the [[evolution_of_ufc_and_impact_on_combat_sports | UFC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:39">[01:34:39]</a>. Training for Power Slap is expected to evolve, with fighters focusing on strengthening their necks, shoulders, and traps to absorb impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:49">[01:34:49]</a>. Athletes from other sports, such as college football players who don't make it to the pros, are expected to be drawn to Power Slap for its financial opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:09">[01:33:09]</a>. The sport will also see the development of dedicated training camps, similar to how [[ufc_and_mma_culture | MMA]] gyms emerged from disparate martial arts disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>. Dana White is actively building new businesses like Power Slap because he enjoys taking niche sports that people believe won't succeed and making them work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:04">[01:38:04]</a>.

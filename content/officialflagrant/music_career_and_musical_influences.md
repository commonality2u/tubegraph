The artist's [[reflections_on_career_and_future_aspirations | music career]] began at a very young age, influenced by his family and deeply rooted in his life experiences. His musical style is characterized by a unique fluidity and confidence, blending various genres and lyrical approaches.

## Early Beginnings and Family Influence
The artist has been rapping since he was about four years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. His father, who he considers "God" and an "animal," always wanted him to be a rapper and believed in him more than he believed in himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:25:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:48">[01:37:48]</a>. His father would battle rap with his uncles on his mother's side of the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>, and his Uncle Moe and cousin Homer were also rappers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. He would join them in the studio, rapping as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. His first song was written about his mother after she passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:19">[01:25:19]</a>.

He would rap battle grown men, with his father encouraging him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a>. This early exposure to music, combined with his family's confidence in him, shaped his innate musicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.

## Musical Style and Approach
The artist possesses a "musical fluency" and an "instinct for musicality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. He can rap comfortably in various ways, not strictly adhering to a single cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>. He describes his process:
> "Sometimes I don't know like I know what it needs to be to get them to move in a way yeah but I don't know the words that are there just yet I have the premise of what I want to talk about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>

He views the words as secondary to the music, rhythm, and sound, stating that the "words on top will make you go this delicious crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. He frequently uses old lyrics written when he was in eighth grade, which he now delivers "better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>. He also notes ideas for lyrics in his phone, based on observations from his daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>.

He doesn't limit himself to one genre, exploring country songs and other styles beyond traditional rap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. He sees himself "unlocking new characters every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a> in his music.

Oliver creates all his own instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.

## Evolution and Identity in Music
Initially, he tried to emulate other rappers, wearing jeans and Jordans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:18">[01:34:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>. However, he eventually embraced his authentic self, opting for his cowboy hat and boots, which coincided with his rise in popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:36">[01:34:36]</a>. This shift to authenticity resonated deeply with his audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:51">[01:34:51]</a>.

He doesn't wear chains or expensive jewelry, believing his music speaks for itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:16">[01:33:16]</a>. He feels his cowboy hat and boots are his "chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:39">[01:33:39]</a>.

Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports, discusses numerous [[Challenges and dynamics of creating adult content|challenges]] inherent in running a major media company, from navigating public perception and controversy to managing rapid growth and internal dynamics.

## Navigating Public Perception and Controversy

Barstool Sports often faces scrutiny and strong opinions due to its content and its founder's public persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Portnoy states that Barstool tries to remain apolitical, aiming to appeal to a broad audience, citing the "Republicans buy sneakers" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. However, this neutrality is frequently challenged by external perceptions.

### Political Polarization
Portnoy acknowledges that his interviews with figures like Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> and appearances on platforms like Fox News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a> lead to Barstool being perceived as politically aligned, particularly by those not closely following their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>. He emphasizes his disdain for political extremes and his nuanced views on issues like Colin Kaepernick's protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a> and abortion rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:12]</a>. Despite supporting positions often associated with the left, Portnoy notes a lack of support from that side, feeling that they "just want to rip my throat out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>.

### Scrutiny Over Past Content and Statements
The company faces ongoing challenges from past content being recontextualized during new social movements. Portnoy cites the example of a clip where he sang a song containing the N-word during a promotional event for Ja Rule and Ashanti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>. Though it went unnoticed for five years, it resurfaced during the Black Lives Matter movement, leading to accusations of racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>. He admits he would "never sing it, never say it in that context again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a>.

Similarly, an older clip discussing Colin Kaepernick's protests was cut to present Barstool as opposing his actions, despite the full conversation acknowledging the legitimacy of protesting police brutality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>. Portnoy states that Barstool's historical content, spanning 20 years, remains publicly accessible, asserting that if they were truly bigoted, there would be more examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>.

### [[Media manipulation and journalism integrity|Media manipulation and journalism integrity]]
Portnoy heavily criticizes outlets like Business Insider, describing their model as focused on "salacious headlines for clicks" and accusing them of [[media_manipulation_and_journalism_integrity|maliciously distorting facts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. He recounts instances where they sought to publish false accusations, relying on sources without due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. In one case, a leaked draft allowed him to proactively counter false claims, proving that the publication was prepared to print inaccuracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

> "People who like Trump are like what a great interview, people don't like Trump it's like you were doing softballs. It's like I don't know nothing about politics like how deep can I get, the first question was a hardball." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>

He believes Barstool is targeted because of its influence and lack of external control, making it "radioactive" to certain political or media factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a>. He recounts ambushing a reporter at her home to confront her about potentially false reporting, highlighting the extreme measures he takes to defend his reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

### Managing High-Profile Talent and Controversies
The "Call Her Daddy" podcast dispute exemplified the [[Challenges and dynamics of creating adult content|challenges]] of managing popular talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Portnoy revealed that the hosts planned to leave, leading to a public controversy that ultimately benefited Barstool by attracting new fans due to his transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

He also faced a situation with a former employee, Francis, who wrote a controversial blog post about a missing girl shortly after she was found murdered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>. Portnoy describes firing Francis as an easy decision because Francis was seen as self-serving rather than loyal to Barstool, and the content was unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:19:00">[22:19:00]</a>. This highlights the difficult balance between protecting the company's image and managing internal talent.

## Business Evolution and Growth
Barstool Sports originated as a gambling newspaper in Boston in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:54:00">[39:54:00]</a>. Portnoy describes its organic evolution, from printing physical newspapers to incorporating "men's interest" content like local girls on the cover, which significantly boosted advertising revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:07:00">[41:07:00]</a>.

### Adapting to New Media and Markets
The companyâ€™s growth involved leveraging new platforms and audiences:
*   **TikTok**: Barstool strategically partnered with TikTok sensation Josh Richards to reach a new, younger audience unfamiliar with Barstool's 20-year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   **Concert Tours**: Early tours, like "Stoolapalooza" and the "Blackout Tour," served as market research to gauge Barstool's reach beyond Boston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:33:00">[43:33:00]</a>. These events proved the strength of their direct connection with fans, who cared more about Barstool itself than the musical acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:02:00">[47:02:00]</a>. Despite financial risks and public safety concerns (riots, overdoses), the tours helped fund Barstool's next phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:35:00">[48:35:00]</a>.
*   **Geographic Expansion**: After proving its popularity in New England, Barstool expanded by opening offices in cities like Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia, replicating its model with local talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:28:00">[49:28:00]</a>.
*   **Investment and Professionalization**: A significant investment in 2016 by The Chernin Group and the hiring of CEO Erika Nardini helped accelerate growth by professionalizing operations and attracting advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50:00">[50:50:00]</a>.

### The Power of Authenticity
Portnoy attributes the viral success of his "pizza reviews" to their organic nature, honesty, and showcasing authentic New York characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. These reviews can significantly boost local businesses, demonstrating Barstool's direct impact on local economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. He now refrains from "crushing" places, recognizing his influence on their livelihoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and Culture
Portnoy emphasizes a competitive, performance-driven culture within Barstool. He sees it as an "athletics vibe," where individuals "win by yourself" through hard work and good content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>. This fosters a highly competitive environment, likened to "SNL where everyone's fighting for air time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a>.

> "I will be very strongly fiercely loyal to people I've perceived be loyal to me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>

Loyalty is a paramount value for Portnoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>. He maintains fierce loyalty to early employees who took risks to join Barstool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>, even if their talent doesn't always match, though he admits to a shift towards expecting production in new hires due to corporate expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.

## Personal Impact and Resilience
Portnoy maintains a grounded perspective despite his success, attributing it to his non-privileged upbringing and his long journey to financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. He still appreciates simple things and avoids cutting lines, remembering his past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

Dealing with constant criticism and false accusations is a significant challenge. While he tries to be resilient, the personal nature of attacks, especially those affecting his family and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:54:00">[53:54:00]</a>, still bothers him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:11:00">[58:11:00]</a>. He states he knows what he's done and hasn't done, which provides a degree of mental protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:00:59">[1:00:59]</a>.

Portnoy also uses a unique method of motivation: keeping champagne bottles engraved with the names of people he dislikes in his office, waiting for the right moment to pop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:29:00">[58:29:00]</a>. This indicates that while he endures public hatred, he also uses it as fuel for his continued drive and work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:00:00">[59:00:00]</a>. He equates this to the "MJ mentality" of thriving on perceived slights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:00:00">[59:00:00]</a>.

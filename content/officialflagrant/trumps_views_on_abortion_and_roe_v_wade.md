[[Donald Trump and political commentary | Donald Trump]] has been a vocal proponent of returning abortion regulation to individual states, a stance he views as the central aim of the Roe v. Wade reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. He believes this aligns with the long-held desire of "no legal scholar, no Democrat, no Republican, liberal, conservative" to have it removed from federal jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.

## Core Stance: State-Level Decision
Trump asserts that Roe v. Wade was primarily about "getting it back to the States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. He notes that states are now voting on the issue, citing Ohio as an example where voters made a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Exceptions to Abortion Bans
While supporting state control, Trump explicitly states his belief in exceptions for:
*   Life of the mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>
*   Rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>
*   Incest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>

He emphasizes that forcing a victim of rape, especially by a violent criminal, to carry a pregnancy to term is unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>. He points out that his stance on these exceptions aligns with Ronald Reagan's long-held position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. Trump believes that the group of people who oppose abortion under "no circumstances" is "smaller and smaller" as they realize the implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>.

## Impact on Republican Elections
Trump acknowledges that a very strong and tough stance on abortion without exceptions could lead to Republicans losing elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. He suggests that his position, which includes exceptions, helps the party's electability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>.

## Support for In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)
Trump strongly supports IVF, characterizing it as a "great thing" that helps women have babies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>. He recounts a situation in Alabama where a judge's ruling threatened to shut down IVF clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>. Following a call from Senator Katie Britt, he publicly came out "strongly in favor" of IVF within 45 minutes of the decision, which he states was crucial for many Republican politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.

He criticizes politicians who are "crooked" and falsely claim he is against IVF, knowing it's untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. Trump states that his advocacy for IVF surprised some people but that he "convinced people that you just can't do that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>.

Stephen A. Smith is widely regarded as one of the greatest [[sports_commentary_and_news | sports journalists]] alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Known for his strong opinions and dynamic presence, Smith has built a career that transcends traditional [[sports_commentary_and_news | sports journalism]], blending reporting with sharp commentary and personal insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Earning the Right to Opinion

Smith's journey in [[sports_commentary_and_news | sports journalism]] began in the newspaper industry, where he emphasizes the importance of earning the right to express an opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:31">[02:30:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. He describes a layered career path involving multiple promotions—from high school reporter to feature writer, college reporter, and pro writer—before being granted the esteemed title of "columnist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

In 2003, when the *Philadelphia Inquirer* named him a columnist, Smith was only the 21st Black person in American history to receive that title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. This extensive background informs his current perspective on younger generations, who can easily express views on social media, often without acknowledging the pioneers who paved the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Smith asserts that his opinions are fact-based, derived from covering the NBA for nearly 30 years and being connected to various figures within the league, including coaches, players, owners, and executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

That's the error I came up in." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>

## "First Take" and Broadcasting Success

Smith is a prominent figure on ESPN's "First Take," which has been the number one show in its slot for 11 straight years, since April 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. In a recent January, the show averaged nearly 600,000 linear television viewers at 10 AM, a time when many people are at work or school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. This figure does not include re-airs or the billions of views garnered on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, when most [[sports_commentary_and_news | sports commentary and news]] shut down, "First Take" remained on air five days a week, continuing to provide content even without live sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:10:00">[43:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:26:00">[43:26:00]</a>. Smith credits figures like Dana White (for pushing UFC fights) and Michael Jordan's "The Last Dance" documentary for providing essential material during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:29:00">[43:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:56:00">[43:56:00]</a>.

## Journalistic Ethics and Relationships

Smith adheres to a strict code of [[the_dynamics_of_trust_and_confidentiality_in_sports_journalism | trust and confidentiality]] in his journalism. He states that most journalists know 75% more information than they reveal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>, and he personally does not reveal 80% of what he knows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. This discretion is crucial for building trust with sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. He maintains that his primary concern is the veracity of information, not whether it will affect a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>. If lied to, he will "roast" the source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>.

Smith draws a clear line: he will report on issues directly related to performance on the field or court, but not personal gossip like affairs or drug use unless it impacts play and is directly observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. He recounts instances where he was approached by GMs or coaches hoping he would leak information about opposing teams, using him as an "instigator of wars" between teams and players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>.

### Notable Player Interactions

Smith has had contentious but ultimately respectful relationships with many athletes:
*   **Allen Iverson:** Smith and Iverson were so close, they were jokingly called a "married couple" by teammates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. They once went eight months without speaking after Smith criticized Iverson for "taking liberties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Their reconciliation was facilitated by Iverson's late friend, Rob, who arranged a meeting at a nightclub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **Kobe Bryant:** Smith mentions a period of eight months where he and Kobe did not speak after Kobe "cussed him out over voicemail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.
*   **Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson:** Smith recalls a heated confrontation in a locker room in Denver with Glenn Robinson, who was upset about Smith's commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>. Years later, Smith apologized to Robinson's son, admitting he was wrong and should have handled the situation more professionally as the "grown-up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>.

## Personal Boundaries and Public Persona

Smith takes measures to protect his personal life and career, especially when traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>. He recounts situations where women were overly aggressive in cities like Miami, Dallas, and LA, leading him to suspect "setups" intended to compromise him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>. He maintains a strict personal code to avoid situations that could "mess with his money" or expose him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:32:00">[30:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>.

He emphasizes the distinction between "what I do" (his professional role) and "who I am" (his personal self), enjoying joking around and engaging in discussions beyond sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:44:00">[42:44:00]</a>. Becoming a father, particularly to two daughters, significantly changed his perspective, making him reflect on past "reckless" behavior and the concept of karma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:00">[38:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>.

Smith views sports as an essential escape from the complexities of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. However, he also recognizes that societal issues have always infiltrated sports, citing historical examples such as:
*   Muhammad Ali's stance against the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>
*   Jim Brown, Bill Russell, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's activism during the Civil Rights era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>
*   Curt Flood's fight for free agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>
*   Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby integrating baseball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>

He defends athletes like Colin Kaepernick, emphasizing that their protests did not disrupt the game itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

While acknowledging LeBron James's universal respect and place on the Mount Rushmore of basketball, Smith states that Jordan was "feared" and would demoralize opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:01:00">[46:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:27:00">[46:27:00]</a>.

### Floyd Mayweather
Smith considers Floyd Mayweather one of the greatest boxers ever, praising his brilliant defensive style, speed, and boxing savvy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:02:00">[47:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:16:00">[47:16:00]</a>. He highlights Mayweather's ability to win fights, especially in the latter half of his career, even with a constantly broken hand, by humiliating opponents through defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:07:00">[49:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:33:00">[49:33:00]</a>.

### Tom Brady
Smith differentiates between "greatest quarterback" and "greatest athlete" when discussing Tom Brady. While acknowledging Brady's resume as the greatest quarterback ever, he argues that Brady lacked the speed, quickness, and agility typically associated with a top "athlete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:20:00">[53:20:00]</a>. He cites Mike Francesa's argument that Brady was neither the greatest regular-season quarterback (Peyton Manning) nor the greatest Super Bowl quarterback (Joe Montana), despite his overall GOAT status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:42:00">[53:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:00">[53:53:00]</a>. Smith points out factors such as playing in a weak AFC East division for years and relying on a strong defense for his early Super Bowls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:27:00">[54:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:02:00">[55:02:00]</a>.

### Kyrie Irving Trade
Smith comments on the [[sports_commentary_and_news | Kyrie Irving]] trade to the Dallas Mavericks, noting that owners like Mark Cuban often have egos that make them believe they can "motivate and manipulate players" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:35:17">[1:35:17]</a>. He highlights Kyrie's history of not playing due to various reasons, which makes the trade a significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:35:00">[1:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:36:00">[1:36:00]</a>.

### Kevin Durant Trade Rumor
Smith discusses the rumored trade of [[kevin_durant_brooklyn_nets | Kevin Durant]] to the Boston Celtics, noting that if it happened, Durant would forever be seen as a player who joined an already great team to win championships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:38:40">[1:38:40]</a>. He points out that the Celtics were already a strong contender, having reached the finals the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:39:14">[1:39:14]</a>.

Smith's extensive career in [[sports_commentary_and_news | sports commentary and news]], marked by strong opinions, adherence to journalistic codes, and a deep understanding of the sports world, solidifies his position as a leading voice in the industry.

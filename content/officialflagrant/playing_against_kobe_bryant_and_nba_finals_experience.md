JJ Redick's journey to the NBA Finals culminated in an unforgettable experience playing against the Los Angeles Lakers and guarding [[kobe_bryant | Kobe Bryant]] in the 2009 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Despite the loss, guarding Bryant stood out as a high point in Redick's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>.

## Journey to the Finals

In his third year with the Orlando Magic, Redick was still on his rookie contract when the team made it to the 2009 NBA Finals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:51">[01:57:51]</a>. He had started seven straight playoff games leading up to the Conference Championship against Cleveland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:10">[01:26:10]</a>. Although he played nine minutes in Game 2, scoring seven points, he saw limited action in other games of that series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:19">[01:26:19]</a>.

## Guarding Kobe Bryant

Entering the Finals against the Lakers, Redick did not play in Game 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. However, in a blowout, he was put in at the end of the game while the Lakers' starters, including [[kobe_bryant | Kobe Bryant]], were still on the court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>. Redick hit a three-pointer and managed to get two stops against Bryant in the late fourth quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>. He then played in Game 2, but the Magic lost, going down 0-2 in the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>. His playing time remained inconsistent, with significant minutes in Game 4 but not Game 3 or 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

Redick considers Bryant the "greatest player he ever had to guard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>, alongside [[lebron_james_vs_michael_jordan_debate | LeBron James]], [[stephen_curry | Steph Curry]], and [[kevin_durant_brooklyn_nets | Kevin Durant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>.

### Kobe's Work Ethic

Redick shared two stories demonstrating [[kobe_bryant | Kobe Bryant's]] legendary work ethic:
*   During a 12-day USA Basketball training camp in 2007, Redick's coach, Coach Dawkins, appeared exhausted because Kobe had him in the gym at 6:00 a.m. for three hours, working on complex counter moves until he made 10 shots in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:48">[01:28:48]</a>. Redick stated, "all those stories about Kobe being a psycho work, they're all true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a>.
*   At the end of the first practice, Kobe invited Redick to shoot with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>. After about 15 minutes, Redick realized Kobe wasn't being friendly, but was intensely observing his shooting form, how he caught the ball, and his footwork, constantly trying to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>.

Redick noted that all the stories about Kobe being a "psycho" regarding his work ethic are true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a>.

## Impact of the Finals Experience

Despite the loss, which "hurt so bad" as it was the closest he ever got to an NBA championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:09">[01:27:09]</a>, guarding [[kobe_bryant | Kobe Bryant]] in the NBA Finals was the "high point" of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>. He keeps multiple pictures saved of himself and Kobe from those games, acknowledging it as a story he will tell his grandchildren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a>.

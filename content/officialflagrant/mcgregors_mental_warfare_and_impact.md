Conor McGregor is considered one of the two best fighters of all time when it comes to mental warfare, alongside Muhammad Ali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. He is seen as being "at Ali's level" in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>.

## Tactics and Influence
[[conor_mcgregors_career_and_legacy | Conor McGregor]] has utilized various mental warfare tactics throughout his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Predicting rounds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>.
*   **Provoking opponents** to get into their heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.
*   **Embarrassing opponents** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>.

These tactics have had a significant impact on his opponents. For instance, Jos√© Aldo was extremely agitated leading up to their fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>. His approach was also evident in the Eddie Alvarez fight leading into Madison Square Garden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>.

## Public Perception and Marketing
Discussions surrounding McGregor's public actions, such as videos of him partying, often raise questions about whether these are genuine or part of a calculated marketing strategy. For example, a video of him partying at his own bar led to speculation that it might be controlled and leaked to influence opponents like Chandler, making them believe [[conor_mcgregor_and_the_mma_scene | McGregor]] isn't taking the fight seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>. This highlights how his actions, even seemingly casual ones, can be perceived as elements of his mental warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.

McGregor's ability to sell himself and his fights, alongside other charismatic figures, is considered a "home run" for the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>. He, along with others, has laid the foundation for their legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.

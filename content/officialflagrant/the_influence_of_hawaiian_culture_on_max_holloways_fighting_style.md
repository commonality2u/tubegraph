Max Holloway's identity as a fighter is deeply intertwined with his Hawaiian roots and the unique culture of Waianae, Oahu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. He emphasizes that he was "born and raised out there," attending Waianae Elementary, Intermediate, and High School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. This upbringing fostered a particular worldview that shaped his approach to combat sports.

## Early Life and the Fighting Spirit

Holloway describes Waianae as a very specific part of Hawaii, noting that it's "the only part that's not gentrified at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. He characterizes the people as incredibly welcoming if treated with kindness, but quick to react to attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:20">[02:18:20]</a>. This duality of being "the kindest, sweetest, most welcoming people that also will fight" is a notable aspect of Hawaiian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:07">[07:05:07]</a>.

Holloway's own fighting journey began not from being a "fighter in school," but from a desire to protect himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:04">[09:55:04]</a>. He compares Waianae High School to the "first UFC Gym" due to the prevalent fighting culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:07">[09:53:07]</a>. His first amateur fight came just two days after his first training session, a decision driven by the desire to get free admission to fights, as paying $35 to watch was more daunting than fighting himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:07">[10:33:07]</a>.

## The Hawaiian Martial Art of Lua

The inherent fighting spirit in Hawaii is deeply rooted in its history. Holloway explains that "back in the day," Hawaiian culture involved a lot of hand-to-hand combat, as they didn't have weapons until colonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. This history is reflected in the traditional Hawaiian martial art called Lua <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:03">[07:49:03]</a>. Holloway describes Lua as "very grungy," involving techniques like "grabbing sand, grabbing testicles and twisting and pulling up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. He also notes that historically, Hawaiian women were also warriors who fought on the front lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:08">[08:30:08]</a>.

## Training Philosophy: Homegrown Talent

Unlike many fighters who relocate to major MMA gyms on the mainland, Holloway has chosen to remain in Waianae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:19">[03:58:19]</a>. He and his wife even moved "deeper into Waianae" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:01">[04:06:01]</a>. This decision was a direct challenge to the common belief that one *must* move to the mainland to achieve a high level in combat sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38:00">[36:38:00]</a>. He argues that all one needs is "a good bunch of guys that's willing to learn, willing to train" with a shared end goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:46:00">[36:46:00]</a>.

Holloway recounts a sparring experience with Jeremy Stephens on the mainland, where he realized that the training was "just like any gym in Hawaii" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>. This experience reinforced his belief that top-tier training is achievable at home. His confidence stems from knowing he can compete anywhere, whether striking or on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>, seeing it as a mental game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

During the pandemic, Holloway famously trained via Zoom, running sprints outside his house and utilizing a friend's mat for drills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>. He even incorporated movements and combinations he learned from playing the UFC 2 video game into his actual training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>.

## Community Pride and Proving Doubters Wrong

Holloway's dedication to staying in Waianae is fueled by a desire to prove people wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a>. He identifies with the "egotistical" nature of people from Waianae who want to show they can fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:30:00">[38:30:00]</a>. He initially felt "victimized" and "owed something" because of his background, but eventually realized that success requires hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>.

He actively works with the Boys & Girls Club in Waianae, hoping to open a gym facility to inspire the next generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:18:18">[39:18:18]</a>. He uses his own story—going from a "hooded kid" who "always got into trouble" to a successful fighter—to show kids that "it's not how you start, it's how you finish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:45:00">[39:45:00]</a>.

Despite his superstardom, Holloway remains grounded. He doesn't display his championship belts around his house because he is "still fighting" and wants to remain focused on future goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>. This mindset reflects a continuous grind rather than resting on past achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.

## Maintaining Connection

Holloway feels a strong sense of pride seeing other Hawaiians succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. He particularly admires Iam Tongi, the American Idol winner, calling him "the reincarnation of brother Iz" and believing his voice is special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. This sense of shared identity and support for local talent is a testament to the community-oriented spirit of Hawaii.

His fight walkout song is "Hawaiian Kickboxer" by a local artist named Monkey Boy, whose father was the janitor at Holloway's elementary school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>. Holloway is adamant about not changing the song, reinforcing his pride in his roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.

While he enjoys traveling, Holloway maintains that no place can compare to the beauty of Hawaii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. His deep connection to his home informs his approach to fighting and his life outside the octagon.

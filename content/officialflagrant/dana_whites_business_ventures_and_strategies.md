[[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | Dana White]]'s journey in the world of combat sports has been marked by a relentless drive and a unique business philosophy, transforming the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) from a struggling entity into a multi-billion dollar enterprise and diversifying into other ventures.

## The Genesis of UFC Ownership

### From Boston to Vegas
[[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | Dana White]]'s path to the UFC began unexpectedly in Boston. A story circulated that a hit was out on him by Whitey Bulger, which [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] states is not true, but it was "sort of like that" though not involving Bulger specifically [01:18:07]. In Boston, there were strict rules, and one of them was not to call the police, as Whitey Bulger was known to work with the FBI against other mob figures [01:46:18]. [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] received a phone call stating he owed money, which he claims was false [02:07:07]. The caller told him he had until Sunday to pay or he would "find out" what would happen [02:24:06]. This prompted [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] to immediately book a one-way ticket to Vegas [02:32:00]. This move to Vegas proved pivotal, as it placed him in the right location for future opportunities, including the purchase of the UFC [02:40:48].

Before entering the UFC, [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] was involved in managing boxers and MMA fighters [01:07:07]. He found that people always came to him for help with their businesses, a trend that continues with daily "Shark Tank" style pitches in his office [01:51:50]. Prior to buying the UFC, his biggest deal was negotiating a fight for Derek Harmon against Roy Jones Jr. [01:09:47].

### Meeting the Fertitta Brothers
While in Vegas, [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] maintained a blanket policy of not attending weddings due to their time-consuming nature [03:49:15]. However, he made an exception for a childhood friend, Adam Corgan, who used to drive him to school every day [04:24:26]. At Corgan's wedding, [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] reconnected with the Fertitta brothers, Lorenzo and Frank, whom he knew from high school [04:55:04]. Lorenzo Fertitta, who had just joined the athletic commission, expressed interest in training with [[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] in boxing [05:25:29]. They began training on a Monday and have been together ever since [05:32:46].

At this time, [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] was running boxing gyms, including United Champions, where he worked alongside Nick One Kick (a Muay Thai trainer) and Roger Mayweather [06:04:18]. He had a close relationship with Floyd Mayweather, who was trained by his uncles Roger and Jeff while his father was in jail [06:29:08]. [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] recalled Floyd's early days, living in an apartment and showing off new sweaters, indicating his long-standing love for shopping [07:35:46]. The gym was a chaotic environment where professional fighters and regular clients trained, and fights would often break out, including a memorable "no rounds" brawl between Roger Mayweather and a heavyweight named Tracy [08:08:10].

### Early Financial Struggles and the Acquisition
[[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]], along with the Fertitta brothers, became addicted to Jiu-Jitsu after meeting John Lewis, a Jiu-Jitsu studio owner in Vegas [01:31:07]. They started training four or five days a week, and during a UFC event, [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] and Lorenzo saw the immense potential, noting the lack of merchandise sales and focus solely on pay-per-view [01:29:32]. They also recognized that unlike boxing, which often featured "mean street" narratives, MMA fighters came from diverse backgrounds, offering unique storylines to appeal to different audiences [01:49:50].

[[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] was managing Tito Ortiz, who had been underpaid by the UFC's then-owner, Bob Meyrowitz [02:05:40]. During negotiations for Ortiz's new contract, Meyrowitz revealed that the company was hemorrhaging money and might not be able to put on the next event [02:49:50]. [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] immediately called the Fertitta brothers, suggesting they buy the struggling company [02:05:40]. A month and a half later, in 2001, they acquired the UFC for $2 million [01:17:00]. This investment, initially seen as "ridiculous" by the Fertittas' financial advisors, is now valued at $12-13 billion [01:19:00].

At the time of purchase, the UFC was essentially just "three letters and an old wooden octagon" with 13-14 fighter contracts [02:07:07]. The previous owner had sold off crucial intellectual property rights, including home video and video game rights, to Lionsgate Entertainment [02:17:48]. In a testament to how little others believed in the UFC's potential, Lionsgate willingly sold these rights back to [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] and the Fertittas for $3 million over four years [02:36:00]. This move proved invaluable, as the subsequent boom in the DVD business led to $2 million checks from UFC DVD sales, which became the primary revenue source at the time [02:44:00].

For the first few years, the UFC was losing money, accumulating a $40 million debt by 2004, with only five events a year and significant overhead expenses [00:03:00]. [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]]'s work ethic involved being in the office from 8:30/9:00 AM to 8:00/8:30 PM daily [02:44:00]. In 2004, Lorenzo called [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]], expressing doubts and suggesting he try to sell the company [02:07:07]. [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] reported back with a potential sale price of $6-7 million [02:51:30], but the next morning, Lorenzo decided to "keep going" [02:54:00].

## Turning the Tide: The Ultimate Fighter

### Investment and Initial Challenges
Believing that free television was the key to success, [[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] and the Fertittas sought a network deal [02:27:00]. They pitched Spike TV (formerly the Nashville Network, then the Men's Network), seeing it as a "perfect slam dunk" fit for a men's show [02:53:00]. However, Spike TV executives initially rejected the idea [02:59:00]. Three days later, [[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] offered to put up the $10 million themselves to produce "The Ultimate Fighter," a reality show concept [02:20:00]. This deal, where they retained 100% of all rights, was attractive to Spike TV because "nobody believed in this thing" [02:46:00].

### The Breakthrough Moment
"The Ultimate Fighter" (TUF) immediately took off, with viewership "spiking" by episode five [03:48:00]. Despite being the network's biggest new show, they received "zero love" in terms of promotion, and the network president was even fired mid-season [03:09:00]. The turning point was the finale, which featured a fight between Forest Griffin and Stephan Bonnar [03:31:00]. The fight was so captivating that it caused Nielsen ratings to spike during the live broadcast, with more people watching than the Masters on CBS at one point [03:51:00]. That night, Spike TV executives pulled [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] and the Fertittas into an alley at the Cox Pavilion and sealed a new television deal on a napkin [03:55:00]. This immediate success led to Forest Griffin becoming a huge pay-per-view star [04:08:00]. By 2006 or 2007, the UFC began to climb out of its $40 million debt, with [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] himself starting to make a million dollars a year [04:10:00].

### Lessons Learned
One significant factor in the UFC's growth was the rise of Jiu-Jitsu, which became wildly popular, educating the audience on ground fighting and removing confusion that might have initially made the sport seem like "just hugging" [02:49:00]. Joe Rogan's commentary was instrumental in explaining the intricacies of the ground game to viewers [02:52:00]. The decline of amateur boxing, plagued by corruption, also created an opening for MMA to gain traction [02:50:00]. [[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] observed that younger generations were opting to train in MMA instead of boxing [02:56:00].

## Philosophy of Combat Sports Promotion

### Storytelling and Fighter Personalities
[[Promotional strategies in combat sports | Dana White]] emphasizes that every fight needs a storyline to create a "rooting interest" for the audience [01:05:01]. This applies even to new ventures like his bull riding event, where a story about his bull's buck rate and a cowboy who previously rode him created audience engagement [01:03:00]. He always aims to create a reason for people to care and watch [01:06:23].

For the UFC, this involves intentionally building up young fighters through programs like the Contender Series, which showcases unsigned fighters in "job interviews" over three rounds, telling their stories and origins [01:07:19]. Millions of people see these fighters before they even step into the UFC, establishing their narrative early on [01:07:54].

While charismatic personalities like [[Conor McGregor]] and Ronda Rousey are a "home run," [[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] states that personality isn't a prerequisite for success [01:08:20]. The primary requirement is being a "bad motherfucker" [01:08:20]. People will watch a dominant fighter like Khabib Nurmagomedov regardless of his personality [01:08:54].

### UFC vs. Boxing: A Contrasting Approach
[[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] frequently contrasts the UFC's approach with boxing's long-standing issues [01:15:17]. He asserts that boxing, despite making "trillions of dollars," has left "nothing there" because of its fractured promoter system where fighters are often kept from fighting each other [01:42:00]. The UFC, in contrast, ensures fans "see the fight that you want to see" every weekend by investing in both fighters [01:43:00]. In boxing, a loss can be career-ending, leading fighters to avoid challenging matchups to protect their "next big payday" [01:44:00]. The UFC's reward structure, including "fight of the night" bonuses, incentivizes fighters to "go out and perform" [01:49:00].

[[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] points to fighters like Arturo Gatti, who, despite losses, remained popular due to his exciting, "blood and guts" fighting style [01:48:40]. He believes a business can be built around such fighters who "give it all they got, win, lose, or draw" [01:49:50]. This also addresses the "paranoid" nature of fighters, who sometimes believe the promotion wants them to lose a fight; by making interesting fights, the UFC shows belief in its fighters [01:52:00]. [[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] also dismisses media criticism that the UFC sets up fighters to fail, stating that once a fighter reaches the top five or three in the UFC, they've already been through a "gauntlet" of tough opponents [01:57:00]. Unlike boxing, where odds often predict the winner, there are "no guarantees" in the UFC [02:00:00].

### Health and Safety Investments
[[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] highlights the UFC's significant investment in health and safety, citing that 10-12 boxers die annually in boxing, while there has never been a death or serious injury in the UFC [03:17:00]. He attributes this to proper medical testing before fights and on-site [03:20:00]. He also notes that boxing gloves, while seemingly protective, can cause more damage, and that excessive sparring in boxing contributes to long-term health issues [03:32:00].

## New Ventures and Future Vision

### Power Slap
[[Future plans and business ventures | Dana White]] launched Power Slap, a new combat sport, in 2022 [03:05:00]. In 15 months, it grew into a $750 million business, generating "billions of views globally" and dominating social media [03:07:00]. [[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] discovered slap fighting on Instagram in 2018, noting a video filmed in a barn with 350 million views, comparable to a Justin Bieber video at the time [03:52:00]. He envisioned sanctioning it as a sport with high production value [03:09:00]. Power Slap's YouTube channel has more subscribers than the NHL, MLS, NASCAR, PGA, and Barstool Sports, with over a billion views [03:30:00]. Eight of the top 12 largest YouTube shorts against major sports are Power Slap, and four of the top five on UFC's own channel are Power Slap, outperforming content featuring [[Conor McGregor]], Ronda Rousey, and Brock Lesnar [03:43:00]. Power Slap also boasts more followers than every professional sports team in 15 months [03:04:00].

[[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] created his own IP for Power Slap, acquiring existing leagues from Poland and Russia [03:06:00]. He sees its broad appeal because "everyone knows what's slapping someone in the face" [03:17:00]. The sport now offers "real money," attracting athletes who train specifically for it, focusing on "torque and velocity and speed" [03:22:00].

### Diversification into Other Sports
Beyond Power Slap, [[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] and the Fertitta brothers own Thr1ve, which produces MTV's *Ridiculousness*, and Nitro Circus [03:28:00]. They are also working on an electric series deal with NASCAR [03:30:00]. [[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]]'s passion lies in taking "niche sports that people don't think work and making them work" [03:35:00].

### The Rice Husk Business
[[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] is currently exploring an investment in a business that converts rice husks, an agricultural waste product, into wood [03:42:00]. This wood is indistinguishable from real wood and equally durable, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional timber [03:47:00]. He views it as a "brilliant business" that is "great for the planet and it's great for Humanity" [03:51:00].

## Personal Drive and Business Acumen

### Love for Fighting and Chaos
[[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] attributes his success to his profound love for fighting, which he's had since childhood [09:41:00]. This includes boxing, martial arts, and even "the fight after school at the park" [09:52:00]. This enduring passion keeps him driven [10:12:00].

### Harnessing Negativity and Building a Team
[[Dana Whites business ventures and strategies | White]] thrives on being told something is impossible [01:13:00]. He loves negativity, especially from those who doubt his ventures [01:31:00]. He frames his motivation around proving critics wrong, stating "I love being told no" [03:51:00]. This philosophy has shaped his business strategy, particularly evident in the UFC's early days when no one believed in it [03:29:00]. He believes his success comes from hard work and building a "team of people that agree with me and say there's nothing we can't do" [02:54:00].

He demonstrates his resolve against "cancel culture," stating that during Joe Rogan's "cancellations," he told the network "if he goes, I go" [01:10:00]. Rogan, who initially worked for free for the first 12-13 UFC shows, was irreplaceable due to his authentic passion and knowledge of the sport [01:15:00]. [[Dana Whites journey with the UFC | White]] emphasizes that only family and friends can truly "cancel" someone, dismissing the opinions of strangers [01:54:00].

### [[Dana Whites gambling experiences | Gambling]] as a Metaphor for Business
[[Dana Whites gambling experiences | Dana White]] is a high-stakes gambler, primarily playing baccarat at Caesars Palace [01:45:00]. He views his gambling as a "war" against the casino, enjoying the competitive aspect of going "toe-to-toe with the biggest casino company in the world" [01:47:00]. Since January 1, he claims to have won $16.5 million from them, only losing twice [01:48:00]. He manages his sessions, stopping if he wins a million dollars, but will go "guns blazing" and lose his entire $6 million credit line if he's losing [01:53:00]. Even then, he notes he'd still be up $10 million [01:54:00]. He describes baccarat as a 50/50 game with better odds than blackjack [01:51:00].

His [[Dana Whites gambling experiences | gambling]] philosophy mirrors his business approach: embrace the highs and lows, focus on the long-term "war" rather than individual "battles," and never give up [02:22:00]. He appreciates Caesars for treating high rollers well, going as far as building a custom room for him and ensuring dealers are positive [01:58:00]. He also highlights the "good gambling vibes" of Chinese baccarat players, who are "absolute degenerate" players [01:59:00]. He takes every penny when he wins, stating he'd never negotiate a reverse deal with a casino [02:06:00]. He believes that if a casino "bans" someone, it's usually because they cheated or aren't a desirable customer, rather than simply being "that good" [02:00:00]. His danger as a player comes from his bankroll and willingness to win a few hands and leave [02:01:00]. He advises gamblers to go to Vegas due to the high competition, better deals, and more favorable treatment [02:07:00].

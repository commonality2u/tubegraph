## Early Family Dynamics and Upbringing

[[that_mexican_ots_upbringing_and_early_life_influences | That Mexican OT's upbringing]] was marked by unusual circumstances and strong personalities within his family. He recounts instances of his mother being involved in drug dealing, specifically crack and cocaine, and being a "savage" figure who would confront people over money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. She even hit his cousin Homer with a brick of cocaine when he asked her about it while she was irritated in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Despite her activities, his mother had him at a young age and was still "being a kid" herself, leading to him being cared for by his aunt Dear Sam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. His mother had an unusual relationship with his father, once telling him she had birth control when she didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

His father, Chuck, played a significant role in his life, particularly in supporting his musical aspirations from a very young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. His father's side of the family encouraged him to be a rapper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Despite his own experiences in prison, where he learned to be "political" rather than gang-affiliated, his father maintained a strong and respectful presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. That Mexican OT's father is described as someone who possesses a powerful "energy" and earns respect through his demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. In prison, he was "scared every day," always watching his back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. He would encourage his son to rap for him and battle other inmates, prioritizing his son's words over radio rappers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. His father also worked as a personal trainer, owning a gym called Conquer Fitness, and taught That Mexican OT to have full control of his body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

His father holds immense confidence in him, viewing him almost like "God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. The greatest thing his father has asked for is his time, valuing "30 seconds of your life" over money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

His grandmother (Nanny) also played a role in his upbringing, and he observed her relationships to learn about women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:20">[01:47:20]</a>.

## Key Relationships and Their Impact

### Mentors and Musical Influences
That Mexican OT's musical journey was heavily influenced by his family. His uncles on his mother's side, Uncle Moe and Uncle Esco, were rappers, forming a "click" with his mother and cousin Homer, and he started rapping with them as a kid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. He grew up listening to a wide range of music, including East Coast rap like Big L, who he considers an "animal" with "crazy hard bars" and "punch lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. He was introduced to Big L by a friend when he was in eighth grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

### Friends and Shared Experiences
His childhood friends were often involved in dangerous activities. He recalls a homeboy named Cameron Pie who was "legally lunatic on papers" and attempted to wrestle a baby alligator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. He also recounts doing cocaine with a homegirl in class at 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. A memorable incident involved running from cops with friends, leading him to jump fences and swim through a river while high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. He later found out his friends got arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

### Romantic Relationships and Personal Growth
That Mexican OT's early experiences with relationships were also impactful. He describes being "slutted out" at around 14 or 15 by a 21 or 22-year-old woman, who he now feels took advantage of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This experience introduced him to sexual acts he didn't expect, leading to a complex relationship where he would ask her to "do that thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. He also expresses a desire to be "slutted out" by a woman again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.

He is currently in a long-term relationship, and his girlfriend is "figuring it out" with his new fame and touring life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. He recognizes the difficulty for his partner, as he's not home often and "more and more people want your attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. He acknowledges that women have strong intuition, which his father also taught him about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Personal Challenges and Transformation

That Mexican OT admits to having a "chip on his shoulder" stemming from childhood experiences like his mother's death and feeling "robbed from everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. This led to bottling up anger, which became "very unhealthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. He realized the unhealthiness of this anger when it physically drained him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. While he doesn't explicitly credit [[role_of_therapy_and_personal_relationships_in_comedy | psychedelics]] for alleviating his anger, he notes his shift towards less confrontational behavior on drugs compared to alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

He recounts [[experiences_with_substance_use_and_its_impact_on_that_mexican_ot | early experiences with substance use]], starting with cocaine at 14, and mixing it with ecstasy and shrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. He has since chosen not to drink alcohol because he becomes "wild" and "mean" on it, preferring to be "friendly" on drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

The artist faced self-doubt, despising himself due to negative comments from family and peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. He describes feeling "broken" and believing what others said about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. However, around the age of 20 or 21, he realized he needed to believe in himself, a turning point he attributes to his father's unwavering belief in his "brilliance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

## Adapting to Fame and Maintaining Authenticity

With his recent success, That Mexican OT experiences family members asking for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>. This frustrates him because he achieved his success through struggle, without asking for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. He acknowledges that hate from others comes with success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.

He has embraced his authentic identity, transitioning from wearing typical rapper attire to his signature cowboy hat and boots, which he realized came naturally from "just being lazy" and wanting to "wear what I will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>. This authenticity has resonated with audiences, especially in New York, where people appreciate his unique style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. His decision to lean into his true self led to his current success, demonstrating that "you could be the best version if you" stop trying to accommodate others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

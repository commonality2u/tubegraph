Shane Gillis is recognized for his unique comedic style, which has propelled him to the top of the [[Comedy and Standup | comedy]] world, notably with "the number one comedy special in the world right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. His approach extends beyond stand-up into acting and sketch comedy, emphasizing a grounded, character-driven humor.

## Acting Style

Shane Gillis has transitioned his comedic sensibilities into acting, notably with his new show, "Tires," which is described as sketches with a narrative arc, making it "hilarious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>. His acting has been praised, with a co-host noting his performance was "great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a> and calling him "a great actor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

Gillis observes that many comedians "suck at acting classes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a> because they are "used to trying to say the funny thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. In contrast, his philosophy for acting is that "your character would never try to be funny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>; instead, the character should be "dead serious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>, allowing "the situation [to be] funny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.

This approach is evident in his sketches, where a funny line might be discarded if it's "too funny" for the character to naturally say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>. He believes that in real life, if someone said a funny line, others would "acknowledge that it was a joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>, unlike traditional sitcoms where characters deliver jokes without in-world reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.

## Comedic Preferences and Influences

While his personal [[Comedy sketches and production insights | comedic style]] is character-driven, Gillis expresses appreciation for a range of [[Comedy and Standup | comedy]]. He describes sitcoms like *Friends* as "punchline punchline punchline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a> and finds them "fantastic" for turning off his brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>. He even admits to liking *The Big Bang Theory* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>, acknowledging that it effectively establishes a world where characters are aware of their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>.

He highly recommends *The Foot Fist Way* as "one of the funniest [\h__\h] shows ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>. His top comedic film is *Friday* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:39">[02:54:39]</a>, followed by *Home Alone* and *Home Alone 2* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:57">[02:54:57]</a>, which he considers "one of the greatest sequels of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:59">[02:54:59]</a>.

A significant influence appears to be *Eastbound & Down*, which he calls "the best comedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:04">[01:45:04]</a>. He appreciates its unique, dark, and hilarious nature, especially how its main character, Kenny Powers, is an anti-hero who is "funny without trying to be funny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:49">[01:45:49]</a>.

Shane Gillis also touches on his personal jokes and bits, such as a repeated anecdote about a sexual encounter where he inadvertently trained his partner to "suck on a Bob" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, a story he finds "funny" and often uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He notes that the humor lies in the situation rather than trying to be funny, which aligns with his acting philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:13">[04:11:13]</a>.

Bobby Lee's past relationship with Kalila, which lasted for several years, has concluded. While they are no longer together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, they maintain a very close friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

## Moving On and New Perspectives

Bobby Lee expresses contentment with his current [[personal_life_and_relationships | personal life]], stating that having a woman in his life who loves him is "so good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. He emphasizes that he is now "free" and focusing on joy, fun, responsibility, and connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>. This shift in perspective appears to be linked to significant personal changes, including seven months of sobriety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. He notes that his sobriety has made him "almost as funny" as he was before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Past Relationship Dynamics
Bobby reflects on a past "fantasy" where he was attracted to "poor" women, viewing himself as a "prince" or "knight in shining armor" who could "save them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. He humorously describes this as seeking "security" by having someone who "can't go anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Friendship with Kalila
Despite the breakup, Bobby asserts that Kalila is his "best friend" and he will "always help her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. When asked to categorize his closest relationships, he places himself and "God" in his "inner circle," Kalila, his mother, and his brother in the "intimate three" circle, and Andrew Santino as the only one in his "third circle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. He later acknowledges that Santino is in his "intimate" circle as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>.

### Financial Aspects
The discussion touches on the financial implications of their separation. Bobby asserts that there is "no common-law marriage in California" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. While California does not recognize common-law marriages, unmarried individuals who have lived together for an extended period may still have some rights, particularly if both contributed to shared assets like a mortgage. However, Bobby states he paid the mortgage on his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### The Mexico Incident
A significant event discussed was Bobby's relapse in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. Andrew Santino describes trying to prevent Bobby from drinking by giving him non-alcoholic "sprite thing[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Bobby eventually relapsed on his own, got drunk, vomited in his hotel room, and answered the door the next day with "poo all over his hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. This incident marked a turning point, with Bobby realizing he "can't continue" with that lifestyle because he didn't "want to lose everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. The seriousness of the situation led to a mutual understanding that the relationship (with alcohol) was "over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

### Personal Growth
Bobby attributes his changed behavior, such as being more punctual and organized, to turning 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>. He explains that the deaths of Bob Saget and Louie Anderson made him reflect on his own health, especially after experiencing coughing up blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:17">[01:28:17]</a>. This experience led him to commit to a "free" and joyful new chapter in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>.

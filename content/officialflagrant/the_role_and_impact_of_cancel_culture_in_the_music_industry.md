Cancel culture significantly influences the careers and creative output of artists in the music industry. While it can serve as a form of accountability, it also presents unique challenges and shifts in how artists interact with their audience and produce content.

## Impact on Artist Careers

One notable effect of cancel culture is its ability to redirect an artist's career trajectory. For some, being "canceled" on mainstream platforms, like YouTube, can lead them to alternative spaces where they might even thrive. For example, it was suggested that "nobody benefited more than the cancel culture of the fresh and fit" because "the more people get cancelled the more they got to go on fresh and Fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

However, the nature of "cancellation" can vary. While some artists might face online backlash or shadowbanning, "real cancellation" can lead to financial consequences and loss of mainstream presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Influence on Creative Content and Artist Behavior

The fear or experience of cancellation can directly influence the content artists produce, particularly in genres like hip-hop.

### Self-Censorship in Rap

In Atlanta, for instance, there's been a crackdown on crime, and District Attorneys are using rap lyrics as evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. This has led to a situation where rappers, including figures like Young Thug and Gunna, might face legal issues based on their lyrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>. Consequently, artists are advised against rapping about "tough shit" or anything that could be used against them in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. This pressure can force rappers to "be creative" and adjust their lyrical content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

There's a prevailing notion that "the most self-incriminating bars usually hit the hardest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>, but this is now a risky endeavor. Artists like [[The controversy and influence around Lil Baby and his music | Lil Baby]] might even "diss" other media personalities to redirect attention away from more controversial topics or real-life issues they cannot publicly discuss due to legal risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>.

### Public Perception and Media Narrative

The public and media's reaction to controversies can significantly shape an artist's image. For example, when a video emerged of a personal incident, there was a readiness to "cancel" based on initial, potentially incorrect, perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>.

The order in which information is revealed can heavily influence public perception. For instance, the timing of [[Kanye West and his impact on fashion, music, and wider culture | Kanye West]]'s bank account closure and label drops was often misconstrued in public narratives, leading to a perception that these were direct consequences of his controversial statements, even if the events preceded the statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:31">[02:26:31]</a>.

### Shifting Platforms and Authenticity

Some argue that artists like 6ix9ine cannot replicate their cultural impact as a "vlogger" on YouTube compared to their influence as a rapper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. This is because "music is just so much more powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:16">[01:47:16]</a>, offering a unique "stickiness" and broader reach that vlogging doesn't match for certain types of controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:23">[01:48:23]</a>.

The concept of [[role of authenticity in music | authenticity]] in rap is also challenged, as artists are expected to "live it" if they "talk this shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:01">[02:51:01]</a>. However, living what they rap about now carries significant legal risks.

## Addressing Controversy: Comedy vs. Ideology

The way controversial topics are approached can determine the severity of backlash. Comedy can provide a "privileged" space to discuss sensitive subjects without facing the same level of condemnation as direct ideological statements.

### The Comedian's Privilege

Comedians and artists are often "allowed to touch these topics that are really Radioactive in a way where people can digest them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:04">[02:08:04]</a>. It's argued that if controversial statements are presented as jokes and understood as such, they are less likely to lead to [[Cancel culture and its impact on comedy | cancellation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:01">[02:18:01]</a>. The key is to convey that it is "a joke" and not a serious ideological stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:02">[02:19:02]</a>.

However, if an artist insists they are "not playing a character" and is "pushing ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:04">[02:05:04]</a>, they face greater risk. This is exemplified by the situation with Andrew Tate, where his insistence on his ideology as reality led to his ban from platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:20">[02:05:20]</a>.

### The Perils of the Manosphere

The "manosphere" and "red pill" ideologies, while offering a sense of community or belief for some, are criticized for promoting "extreme shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:58">[02:09:58]</a> and potentially dangerous attitudes towards women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:46">[02:04:46]</a>. When these niche rhetorics go "mainstream," they risk cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:55">[02:07:55]</a>.

### The Dilemma of Silence

Artists and public figures are sometimes forced to make a "cognizant" decision to avoid discussing certain topics to prevent controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:30">[02:29:30]</a>. This indicates that the perceived risk of engaging with specific issues outweighs the desire for open discussion.

## Artists and the Music Industry

The [[music industrys influence on artist behavior | music industry's influence on artist behavior]] and financial structures play a significant role in how artists navigate and react to cancel culture.

### Artist Control and Financial Models

Artists need to maintain control over their narrative and platforms to effectively combat cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:55">[02:13:55]</a>. Losing access to direct communication channels means they are "what people say you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:37">[02:06:37]</a>.

The traditional streaming model in music, where artists get a small fraction of revenue, encourages relying on volume over direct sales, making them more vulnerable to cultural shifts compared to artists like Taylor Swift who prioritize physical sales and unique fan experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:31">[03:13:31]</a>. Taylor Swift's ability to "wield" influence over streaming companies to increase payout rates demonstrates the power of an artist with a strong, dedicated fanbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:01">[03:15:01]</a>.

### Lack of Shared Information

In the rap industry, there's a perceived lack of information sharing among artists regarding their deals. Instead of collaborating to negotiate better terms, many artists sign similar "Ponzi scheme" deals and later complain about them, hindering collective progress <a class="yt=" data-t="03:07:27">[03:07:27]</a>. This competitive and often uninformed approach leaves artists vulnerable to exploitation and makes it harder for them to build lasting financial stability, independent of external controversies.

### [[Comedian experiences with cancellation and controversy | Comedian experiences with cancellation and controversy]]

Comedians, like musicians, grapple with the impact of cancel culture. The line between a joke and an offensive statement is fluid, and misinterpretations can lead to severe backlash. However, the art form of comedy itself offers a certain protection, as long as the intent is clearly comedic and not ideological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:04">[02:08:04]</a>.

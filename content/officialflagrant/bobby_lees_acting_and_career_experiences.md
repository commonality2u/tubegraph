Bobby Lee, known for his comedic work, has had a diverse career in acting, marked by various roles and a distinctive performance style.

## Acting Skills and Range

Discussions often revolve around Lee's acting capabilities. He demonstrates a surprising ability to cry on cue, even fabricating a scene on the spot involving a son needing a heart transplant and a father sacrificing himself [00:00:09], though he humorously twists the ending [00:00:39]. Despite this, he admits he is "not a good actor" [00:22:28] and often defaults to humor when given a serious opportunity [00:39:36].

However, others praise his acting, with one peer stating he is "incredible at actually so good" [00:41:02] and was "very good" on the show *Reservation Dogs* [00:40:51]. There's a playful debate about whether Andrew Santino has "another gear" in acting compared to Lee [00:07:07].

## Notable Acting Roles

Lee has accumulated several acting credits throughout his career:
*   **_Mad TV_**: He was on this hit television show "five years into the game" of his career, describing it as "so much opportunity" [00:42:55].
*   **_Pineapple Express_**: He mentions his involvement in this film [00:18:18].
*   **_Game On_**: A competitive game show where he appeared alongside athletes like Rob Gronkowski and Serena Williams [00:14:26]. He described the show as "terrible" [00:14:05], but acknowledged it was a way to earn money [00:14:11].
*   **_Reservation Dogs_**: He plays a "Korean doctor" in this series [00:38:34]. He noted that his character is based on a real-life phenomenon where many doctors on reservations are Korean, often due to programs that pay back medical school loans for those who work in underserved areas [00:38:44].

## Career Trajectory and Opportunities

Lee reflects on his career opportunities, especially compared to others. He acknowledges that he "obviously had not had more opportunity" [00:42:50] than some, implying his roles were often less conventional due to not fitting the "hot boyfriend" or "handsome picked dude" archetype [00:44:14]. He emphasizes that he had to "go out for shit" and work hard to get roles [00:44:27].

He also discusses the different approaches to the [[comedy_industry_insights_and_career_reflections | entertainment industry]], noting that he still holds a "weird fascination with old Hollywood like acting and getting deals" [00:40:11].

## Personal Reflections and Aspirations

Lee believes that his sense of humor developed as a "defense mechanism" due to significant trauma in his life, which he later turned into a career [01:20:01].

He expresses a desire to do a serious drama movie with Andrew Santino, humorously suggesting themes like secret agents, oil drillers splitting asteroids, or even a remake of *Two Girls One Cup* [00:47:47]. He specifically envisions a role where he portrays deep emotion, like the character of Rooster from *Top Gun* [00:48:47].

## Working with Andrew Santino

Their professional relationship is a recurring theme, with mutual respect for each other's comedic and acting talents. They discuss their dynamic on their podcast, *Bad Friends*, which they plan to take on a "theater tour" next year, combining stand-up and live podcasting [01:30:47]. Lee views Santino as a close friend, placing him in his "intimate circle" [01:32:31], and values his patience and guidance, especially regarding sobriety [00:18:43]. Santino once saved Lee from relapsing in Mexico by giving him a non-alcoholic drink [00:18:30], although Lee later got drunk on his own [00:20:42] and describes a chaotic hotel room incident [00:21:05].

Their friendship extends to playful banter and critiques of each other's styles, from walking ten paces apart in public [01:10:41] to debates about who is "wackier" [00:36:26]. Lee appreciates Santino's willingness to do "anything for the laughs" [01:04:58], even if it involves showing his penis on stage (though Lee no longer does this) [01:05:07].

## Personal Growth

Lee shares that he is turning 51 soon [01:28:40] and that a significant turning point in his life came after a period of intense smoking and coughing up blood [01:28:17]. The deaths of Bob Saget and Louie Anderson prompted him to re-evaluate his health and life [01:27:43]. He decided that the next chapter of his life would be "free" and filled with "joy and fun and responsibility and connection" [01:28:30]. This shift has led to improved punctuality and meeting commitments [01:27:32]. He also mentions moving on from his previous relationship with [[bobby_lees_relationship_with_kalila_and_moving_on | Kalila]], maintaining a close friendship with her while acknowledging she is moving out [00:01:13].

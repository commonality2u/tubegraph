The Great Pyramid of Giza is described as a "totally utterly unique, extraordinary and special" monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:54">01:52:54</a>. It stands on the Giza plateau alongside two other massive pyramids and several satellite pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">01:47:04</a>.

## Construction and Design

The Great Pyramid was originally 481 feet tall, but its current height is about 450-455 feet, having lost its summit around 1301 CE, possibly due to an earthquake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:47">10:04:47</a>. The exterior was once covered with magnificent facing stones, which also came off during the earthquake and were subsequently used as a quarry by locals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:38">10:57:38</a>. The pyramid's base is built around a natural hill, with the first 30 feet of its interior being a natural mound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:21">20:01:21</a>.

The construction of the Great Pyramid, involving 6 million tons of stone and 2.5 million individual blocks, would have been extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:23">20:51:23</a>. The varying sizes of the courses (layers of blocks), some chest-high, made climbing it a challenge, and managing such a task with a huge workforce and blocks is hard to imagine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:09">09:23:09</a>.

### Alignment and Dimensions
The Great Pyramid is almost perfectly aligned to True North, within 3/60ths of a single degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">01:17:20</a>. This precision indicates that its builders were performing "very accurate work" and intended to connect the monument to the Earth's cardinal directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:41">01:39:41</a>. Located at approximately latitude 30 degrees North, one-third of the way between the Equator and the North Pole, the pyramid also symbolically "speaks to the Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">02:29:43</a>.

Its dimensions encode global measurements:
*   Original height (481 feet) multiplied by 43,200 gives the polar radius of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">01:00:38</a>.
*   Base perimeter multiplied by 43,200 gives the equatorial circumference of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">01:03:00</a>.
The number 43,200 is derived from the Earth's precession, specifically 600 times 72, where precession occurs at a rate of one degree every 72 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">01:03:07</a>. The mathematical constant Pi, used to calculate the diameter and circumference of a circle, is also built into the Great Pyramid, which is largely accepted by Egyptologists as a coincidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">01:02:44</a>.

### Internal Features
The Great Pyramid contains several internal chambers and passageways. The actual entrance system of the Great Pyramid was not found until around 900 CE by the Khalif Al Mamon, who, knowing other pyramids had north-facing entrances, hacked his way into the North Face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">01:04:12</a>. His team heard a falling block, which led them to the original passages. This hacked entrance is now known as M Moon's Hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">01:05:05</a>.

Inside, the so-called "King's Chamber" (where no burial was found, but a sarcophagus remains) has four narrow shafts pointing North and South that exit the pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">01:15:58</a>. The "Queen's Chamber" also has two shafts, discovered in 1872 by Freemason John Wayman Dixon, who knocked on the smooth inner wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">01:16:47</a>. These shafts initially go horizontally then point upwards, but do not exit the pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">01:17:23</a>.

Beneath the pyramid, a subterranean chamber is cut out of solid bedrock, about 100 feet vertically below the base and 600 feet below the apex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:49">02:08:49</a>. This chamber has curious acoustic effects, including a resonance that allowed an opera singer's voice from the King's Chamber to be heard below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:57">02:11:57</a>. This subterranean chamber, along with the natural mound above it, is theorized to be the original sacred site on the Giza Plateau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">02:07:08</a>.

## Theories and Controversies

### Archaeoastronomy and Ancient Chronology
The angles of the shafts in the Great Pyramid point to significant stars during the period when Egyptologists believe the pyramid was built (around 4,500 years ago) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">01:17:31</a>. For example, one shaft points to the lowest of Orion's Belt stars, a constellation identified with the god Osiris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">01:17:45</a>.

However, the ground pattern of the three Giza pyramids, which mirrors the three stars of Orion's Belt, aligns perfectly to the sky "only perfect 12,500 years ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">01:54:54</a>. This [[speculations_about_ancient_civilizations_and_their_advanced_knowledge | astronomical alignment]], combined with the positions of the Nile River and the Milky Way, suggests an older date for the site's design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">01:54:54</a>. The difference in dating (4,500 years ago for shafts vs. 12,500 years ago for ground plan) leads to the theory that while the ancient Egyptians built most of the pyramids, they did so on a "prehistoric foundation" that had been sacred for much longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:59">02:17:59</a>.

### The Great Sphinx
The Great Sphinx, also on the Giza plateau, is proposed to be a multi-phase monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">02:44:00</a>. Geological evidence, particularly "precipitation-induced weathering" on its trench walls, suggests it was exposed to a long period of heavy rainfall, which occurred 12,000+ years ago, not during the traditional Dynastic Egyptian period (4,500 years ago) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">02:51:50</a>.

The theory suggests the Sphinx's core body dates back 12,000+ years, originally in the form of a lion with a massive leonine head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:33">02:58:33</a>. Around 4,500 years ago, when the head was damaged, the Dynastic Egyptians re-carved it into a human head with a pharaoh's headdress, which explains its disproportionate size to the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:33">02:58:33</a>. The Sphinx's gaze, perfectly aligned due East to the sunrise on the Spring Equinox, further supports an older origin as this alignment corresponds to the "Age of Leo" (12,000 years ago), where the constellation Leo would rise behind the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:04">04:10:04</a>.

### "Secret Knowledge" and Egyptian Authorities
Graham Hancock's work suggests that a body of [[secret_knowledge_and_conspiracies | knowledge]] was passed down within ancient Egyptian culture, leading to the construction of the Great Pyramids to honor and memorialize a site of "enormous significance" from a time they called "Zep Tepi" (the First Time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:43">02:24:43</a>. He argues that the superior workmanship of the Giza pyramids compared to later Egyptian pyramids like the Pyramid of Unas indicates a potential "slump" in building capabilities, or a re-manifestation of earlier knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:55">02:56:55</a>.

Hancock believes his questioning of the mainstream archaeological narrative about Egyptian history led to Egyptian authorities banning him from filming in Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">01:21:11</a>. This opposition is partly due to the "rigid fixed view" among Egyptologists and a perceived threat to their cultural identity tied to the pyramids' creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">01:11:11</a>. A public debate in 2015 with leading Egyptologist Zahi Hawass, where Hawass reportedly lost his temper and stormed out, exacerbated the negative relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">01:15:15</a>.

Hancock states that his theories, which are often labeled as "racism, white supremacy, misogyny, and anti-Semitism" by critics, are based on reporting indigenous myths about "white-skinned bearded strangers" who brought knowledge after a cataclysm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:47">03:20:47</a>. He clarifies that his interest is in the ideas and cultural aspects, not ethnicity or genes, and points to the universality of certain myths like those of the "seven sages" appearing after a flood to restore [[secret_knowledge_and_conspiracies | knowledge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">03:40:40</a>.

## Personal Experiences with the Pyramids

Graham Hancock has a "long relationship with the Great Pyramid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">01:58:00</a>. He climbed it illegally several times, first in 1994 or 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">02:37:37</a>. The first illegal climb involved a 4 AM start and a lot of bribery to guards, eventually costing more due to additional demands from guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:44">02:28:44</a>. He advises climbing the southwest corner as it's more intact and less visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">03:11:00</a>. He also participated in a mass climb during an Eid celebration with hundreds of locals, which highlighted the immense difficulty of the pyramid's original construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">05:10:00</a>. He has also had three legal climbs for filming projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">04:48:00</a>. Climbing the pyramid is now totally illegal and dangerous, with at least one person dying annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">08:46:00</a>.

During one climb, he found his grandfather's (Philip Hancock) name and the date April 5th, 1916, inscribed on a block on the southeast side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">06:01:00</a>. His grandfather, a British forces chaplain in Egypt during WWI, documented this climb in his diaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">07:16:00</a>. In 1916, climbing the Great Pyramid was "totally free range" and legal, with no objections from authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">07:44:00</a>.

Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson has maintained a unique presence in the entertainment industry, often operating outside traditional norms. His relationships and collaborations with other artists and industry figures reflect this approach, ranging from competitive rivalries to close friendships and strategic business partnerships.

## Early Interactions

Even before his music career took off, 50 Cent was involved in the street life of New York. He recounts a time in high school when his crew effectively ran someone named Al Alex off their corner in Far Rockaway, marking an early display of dominance and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Key Musical Relationships

### Eminem
[[collaborations_and_experiences_with_famous_artists | Eminem]], or "M," holds a significant place in 50 Cent's career. Eminem has consistently praised 50 Cent's rapping skill, which means a lot to 50 Cent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. 50 Cent views Eminem as an artist who constantly refines his craft in the studio, a regimen that is hard to beat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Eminem's dedication to his art, akin to Kobe Bryant's work ethic, sets him apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Eminem's freestyling ability is also highlighted, where he can be given a word and instantly flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

Eminem rarely tours, but 50 Cent views himself as a crucial connection to both Eminem and Dr. Dre, implying he can facilitate collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>. He plans to include Eminem on a new Snoop Dogg album in his upcoming residency set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:08">[01:48:08]</a>.

### Nas
Nas provided crucial early support for 50 Cent. Nas acknowledged the disruptive nature of 50 Cent's track "How to Rob," recognizing it as a "crazy" and "ill move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. Nas’s co-sign was significant, as it was early in 50 Cent's career and could have created enemies for Nas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

However, their relationship later became complicated. 50 Cent revealed that a collaboration he had recorded with Jennifer Lopez was replaced by Nas on the track due to external pressures from Irv Gotti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. Despite this, 50 Cent states he still loves Nas, who took him on tour when 50 Cent was still developing as a rapper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.

### Jay-Z
50 Cent describes his relationship with [[drakes_business_relationships_in_music_industry | Jay-Z]] as primarily competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. He alleges that Jay-Z tried to block his involvement in the Super Bowl halftime show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a> and other business deals, such as his Vitamin Water endorsement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>.

50 Cent also criticizes Jay-Z's perceived shift in public image, suggesting that his marriage to Beyonce greatly influenced his increased success and Grammy wins, framing it as a strategic business move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:01">[01:52:01]</a>. He jokes that Jay-Z's success is tied to being seen as a "businessman, entrepreneur, family man" rather than a street rapper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:01">[01:53:01]</a>.

### Diddy (Sean Combs)
50 Cent has a deeply antagonistic relationship with Diddy, often publicly criticizing and mocking him, particularly in light of recent legal troubles. He consistently highlights Diddy's alleged actions and legal issues, making jokes about them on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. 50 Cent feels he was the "crazy guy" for a long time, calling out Diddy's alleged behavior when others were silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. He is actively producing a documentary project about Diddy, aiming to make it as fair and true as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>. He claims Diddy is "not a scary guy" and was never "a scary guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:41">[02:29:41]</a>.

### Drake
Regarding the recent beef between [[lil_dickys_interactions_with_celebrities_like_drake_and_brad_pitt | Drake]] and Kendrick Lamar, 50 Cent believes the lawsuit against Drake was strategic, aiming to stop potential damage from a Super Bowl performance where Kendrick might have made damaging allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. 50 Cent feels that people are "ready to hate on Drake anyway" because he's "on top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>. He compares Drake's experience on top to his own, where "everyone wants to take a shot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:42">[01:36:42]</a>.

50 Cent would advise Drake to pivot more into acting and film, suggesting that taking a break from music would make fans miss him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:02">[01:44:02]</a>.

### Kendrick Lamar
50 Cent views Kendrick Lamar as "technically" closer to Dr. Dre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:34">[01:36:34]</a>. He notes that Kendrick has received "trophies" and a Pulitzer Prize, which 50 Cent sees as a reflection of how the industry would like hip-hop to be – less aggressive and more marketable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>.

### Snoop Dogg
Snoop Dogg's upcoming album will feature 50 Cent and Eminem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:08">[01:48:08]</a>.

## Other notable relationships

Despite their occasional "fights" or disagreements, 50 Cent clarifies that he doesn't hate Floyd and views him as a brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:52">[01:57:52]</a>.

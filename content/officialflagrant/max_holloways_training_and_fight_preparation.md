Max Holloway's approach to fighting is deeply rooted in his upbringing and personal philosophy, emphasizing mental fortitude, self-sufficiency, and a commitment to his Hawaiian roots. He trains rigorously, adapting to circumstances while maintaining a unique perspective on combat and preparation.

## Early Beginnings and Motivation

Holloway began kickboxing in 10th grade primarily to learn how to protect himself [0:09:55]. His first amateur fight occurred just two days after his initial training session [0:10:33]. Initially, he aspired to be a K1 kickboxer but transitioned to MMA after witnessing the financial opportunities presented by UFC fighters like BJ Penn [0:11:31]. After his debut fight, he felt it was "fun" and realized he "needed to do this again" [0:12:46].

## Training Philosophy and Location

Holloway has consistently chosen to train in Hawaii, defying the common belief that fighters must relocate to major mainland MMA gyms to reach the highest level [0:37:00]. He asserts that all one needs is "a good bunch of guys that's willing to learn" and a shared end goal [0:36:46]. His experience sparring at a mainland gym (Jeremy Stephens' camp) reinforced his belief that it was no different from a gym in Hawaii [0:37:32]. This decision is partly driven by a desire to prove doubters wrong and a sense of pride from his hometown of Waianae, where he is currently working on opening a new gym facility for local kids [0:38:42].

## Adapting Training During the Pandemic

During the pandemic, Holloway continued his [[training_and_nutrition_strategies_for_mma_fighters | training]] through unconventional means. He primarily trained via Zoom, with coaches outlining game plans and ensuring he was keeping up with drills [0:31:24]. He also utilized a friend's mat for drills and performed cardio by running sprints outside his house [0:33:51]. He humorously noted that local authorities were strict about people being outside, leading him to avoid being seen in his loud, matte red Tesla [0:32:07].

## Fight Strategy and Mental Game

Holloway identifies his main competitive advantages as distance control and confidence [0:18:31]. He feels comfortable fighting in any range â€“ striking, wrestling, or on the ground [0:18:49].

He views MMA as a mental game, believing that the difference between top fighters and others in the UFC lies in their ability to apply a game plan consistently [1:00:53]. He states that many fighters "beat themselves before they even step in" due to nervousness or the moment getting to them [1:01:27].

### Use of Video Games in Training
Interestingly, Holloway has incorporated elements from the UFC 2 video game into his [[training_and_nutrition_strategies_for_mma_fighters | striking]] technique [0:34:57]. He discovered new combinations while playing, such as a simultaneous jab and front kick, and practiced them with his sparring partners [0:35:45]. These moves proved effective in real fights [0:35:42].

### Handling Opponents
Holloway has a reputation for engaging with opponents during fights, sometimes even offering advice. In his fight against Brian Ortega, he famously grabbed Ortega's hand and placed it to demonstrate where it should be to avoid punches [0:20:48]. He also recalls hearing [[Max Holloways friendship and rivalry with Daniel Cormier | Daniel Cormier]] commenting during a fight and responding by telling the commentators to "count it up" as he landed combinations [0:21:19]. Despite the intensity of fighting, he expresses respect for anyone who makes the walk to the octagon and fights him [0:32:56].

### Weight Cutting
Holloway, standing at six feet tall, admits that cutting weight makes him look "skinny" and "like death" [0:26:12]. However, he states that the process has become easier since his wife helps him stay disciplined [0:26:57]. He typically walks around at 160-165 pounds, staying in shape for potential fights [0:27:13].

## Pre-Fight Rituals and Motivation

Holloway experiences nervousness before fights, believing it's a sign that he has put in enough work and has something to lose [1:04:27]. His pre-fight ritual involves a unique internal dialogue: he mentally tears himself down by asking why he's there and suggesting an "easy life" like working at McDonald's, only to then build himself back up by reminding himself that the "life you want to live costs money" [1:05:00]. Once his walkout song begins, he transitions into fight mode, eager to enter the octagon [1:05:31].

He sees every fight as an opportunity and a challenge, particularly against high-caliber opponents like Korean Zombie [0:57:12]. He constantly seeks to fight the best, even expressing a desire for another crack at Volk, stating, "if you want me to fight Volk, stop giving me these freaking contenders" [0:58:43].

## Notable Fights and Experiences

Holloway has faced some of the biggest names in MMA.

### "Best Chin" Reputation
Holloway is widely recognized for having one of the best chins in combat sports [0:5:58]. While he claims to have never truly been rocked, he recalls a moment during his fight with Andre Fili when he was hit and momentarily distracted, looking at the clock rather than his opponent [0:13:53]. He also famously ate a head kick from Yair Rodriguez without significant impact, expressing surprise only that Rodriguez could kick so high [0:14:28].

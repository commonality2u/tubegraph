Professional fighter Dylan Danis has openly discussed the profound impact [[dealing_with_physical_injuries_in_sports | physical injuries]] can have on mental health and his journey through recovery. His experience highlights how the inability to pursue one's passion, coupled with personal tragedies, can lead to a dark period, and the importance of resilience and self-reflection in overcoming such challenges.

## The Onset of a Difficult Period
Danis revealed that a significant knee injury marked the beginning of a challenging period in his life, starting in 2019 and lasting until 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. He described this time as very difficult, admitting he "almost died" and didn't want to be alive anymore, a sentiment he still deals with daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.

During this time, Danis was also dealing with the passing of his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. His father had struggled with alcoholism after 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:03">[01:37:03]</a>. The combination of his own injuries and these personal losses led him to use alcohol to "numb himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>. He found himself "going out every night" in New York City, surrounded by temptations, simply because he was "hurt" and unable to train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. He characterized himself as a "menace" during this time, getting into fights and acting out, stating "hurt people hurt people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>.

## The Role of Training in Mental Well-being
Danis emphasized that his knee injury was the catalyst for his struggles because it removed his "calmness" derived from training two or three times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>. He described training as a "drug" or a "shot" that provided relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:53">[01:24:53]</a>. When unable to move and faced with a long recovery period, he realized how dependent he was on exercise to calm his mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>.

His knee injuries were severe, requiring two surgeries, one of which used cadaver ligaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:52">[01:25:52]</a>. This physical setback stripped away his identity as a fighter, leaving him feeling lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>.

## Navigating Recovery and Support
Danis sought help from individuals who understood his struggles. He spoke with comedian Theo Von, who also deals with similar issues, finding common ground in their experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>. While Danis doesn't identify as an alcoholic, he views alcohol as a means to numb pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:08">[01:24:08]</a>. His sobriety at the time of the interview was eight months, though he doesn't rule out drinking in the future, believing it was more about his life circumstances than the alcohol itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

### Forgiveness and Loyalty
Danis admitted he struggles to forgive himself for his past actions during this dark period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>. He believes that true friends are there during both good and bad times, an observation he made about his own friendships during his difficult phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. He reflected on how many friends abandoned him, highlighting the isolation that can come with rising prominence in any field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. However, he cherishes loyalty, like that shown by [[Conor McGregor's mindset and career strategy | Conor McGregor]], who defended Danis publicly despite potential criticism, because Danis had always shown him loyalty in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Future Outlook
Danis's experience with injury and recovery has led to a re-evaluation of his life. The birth of his child has been a significant motivator, making him happier and pushing him harder in training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>. He noted that becoming a father brought a "weird feeling" of skin-to-skin connection and a primitive realization of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. He also expressed a rekindled [[role_of_mentality_and_meditation_in_sports | faith in God]], believing he shouldn't be alive after what he went through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

Despite the personal struggles and the shift in his public perception, Danis maintains his core identity. He asserts that he hasn't changed from the "bad guy" persona that people find entertaining, and that his ability to "turn it on" is a talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. He feels his experiences, though painful, were necessary and ultimately made him stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

The use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in sports is a complex and often controversial topic, impacting athletes' performance, careers, and the integrity of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:53">[01:38:53]</a>.

## Rationale for PED Use

Athletes may use PEDs to gain an advantage in competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11">[01:39:11]</a>. The rigorous training required for combat sports, for instance, can lead to severe mental and physical exhaustion; one fighter described waking up "depressed" daily due to the demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:47">[01:39:47]</a>. PEDs aid in recovery, making it feel like a "distant memory" by the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>.

### Perceived Benefits
PEDs can make athletes "bigger, stronger, faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">[01:40:12]</a>.
*   **Strength** is a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.
*   **Recovery** is described as "incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>.
*   PEDs are viewed as "medicine" designed to "make you better," similar to any other medical treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## Types of PEDs Mentioned

The "big three" performance enhancers are:
*   **EPO (Erythropoietin)**: Increases red blood cells, enhancing endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:55">[01:40:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:02">[01:41:02]</a>. It is considered "king" for stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:17">[01:41:17]</a>.
*   **Growth Hormone (GH)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>.
*   **Testosterone** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>. Pure testosterone can be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>.
*   **HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)**: Used to naturally boost testosterone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:52">[01:41:52]</a>.
*   **Peptides**: Mentioned as a newer trend, especially among Hollywood figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:57">[01:41:57]</a>.

## Testing and Loopholes

While testing exists, there are known methods to evade detection:

*   **Out-of-competition testing** became a significant challenge because testers could show up unannounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.
*   **IV (Intravenous) Flushing**: This method can rapidly flush substances out of the body, allowing an athlete to pass a drug test within hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:49">[01:52:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:15">[01:53:15]</a>. This technique was reportedly used by Lance Armstrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:49">[01:52:49]</a>. Organizations like USADA attempted to combat this by claiming they could detect plastic particles from IV use, but this claim is disputed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:26">[01:53:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:43">[01:53:43]</a>.
*   **Dosage Limits**: Even if an IV is detected, regulations often specify a limit on the volume of liquid allowed (e.g., 30ml) rather than total quantity over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>. This loophole means an athlete could potentially administer multiple 30ml IVs throughout a day without technically violating the rule as currently written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:58">[01:53:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:03">[01:54:03]</a>.

### Controversies and Accusations
*   **Islam Makhachev IV Situation**: A nurse claimed Islam Makhachev used an IV, which could be a violation depending on what was infused and the dosage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:40">[01:49:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:41">[01:50:41]</a>. The individual who outed him was criticized for violating patient privacy (HIPPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:56">[01:50:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Jon Jones**: Has failed multiple drug tests, a fact openly discussed in relation to his career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:34">[02:26:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **LeBron James**: Implicated in using EPO due to an alleged shared "drug guy" with a fighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:32">[01:40:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:57">[01:40:57]</a>. This claim suggests that if other basketball players understood the effects of performance enhancers, it would be a major revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:18">[01:40:18]</a>.
*   **Tiger Woods**: The only golfer mentioned who allegedly follows the "big three" PED regimen (EPO, growth hormone, testosterone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:46">[01:40:46]</a>.

## Regulation and Athlete Responsibility

While "steroids are bad" and "performance enhancers are bad" are common statements, it is argued that this applies to *abuse* rather than *use* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. The problem often arises when athletes are given substances to take home, leading to self-administration beyond recommended levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:13">[01:43:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:21">[01:43:21]</a>.

It is suggested that most professional athletes, particularly in the NFL, look "ridiculous" due to their physiques, implying widespread PED use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:23">[01:54:23]</a>. However, it is also noted that very few athletes in basketball or golf are known to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:30">[01:54:30]</a>.

A fighter admitted to intentionally using performance enhancers to gain an advantage, stating they "wouldn't have taken it if [they] didn't think [it would] give [them] an advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:14">[01:39:14]</a>. This highlights a perspective where the goal is to *[[use and effects of drugs like Adderall and cocaine | cheat within the rules]]* or push boundaries for competitive gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>.

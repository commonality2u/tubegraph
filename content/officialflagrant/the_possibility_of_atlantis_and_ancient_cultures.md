From: [[officialflagrant]] <br/> 

The discussion surrounding the existence of [[speculations_about_ancient_civilizations_and_their_advanced_knowledge | Atlantis]] and other advanced [[Ancient Technologies and Civilizations | ancient cultures]] challenges mainstream archaeological narratives, suggesting a deeper, more complex human history than currently accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These alternative perspectives are often met with skepticism, yet proponents point to geological, astronomical, and mythological evidence to support their claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Plato's Atlantis and Coinciding Dates

Plato's dialogues, *Timaeus* and *Critias*, describe the submergence of [[speculations_about_ancient_civilizations_and_their_advanced_knowledge | Atlantis]] 11,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This date strikingly aligns with the estimated construction of Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, considered the most important archaeological site in the world today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Mainstream archaeologists tend to dismiss any mention of [[speculations_about_ancient_civilizations_and_their_advanced_knowledge | Atlantis]], likening it to "Flat Earth for archaeologists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Egyptian Texts Supporting an Earlier Civilization

The Temple of Horus at Edfu in Upper Egypt, though relatively recent (built around 270 BC by the Ptolemaic dynasty), contains inscriptions in Middle Egyptian dating back to around 2000 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:08">[02:11:08]</a>. These texts, based on older temple archives, recount a story strikingly similar to Plato's [[speculations_about_ancient_civilizations_and_their_advanced_knowledge | Atlantis]] narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>. They speak of a sacred island called "the homeland of the Primeval ones," destroyed by a great serpent from the sky (possibly a comet impact) and a massive flood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>. Survivors, including "seven sages," then traveled the world to rebuild their [[Ancient Technologies and Civilizations | lost civilization]], with Egypt being one of their destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>. The destruction of this homeland is referenced as occurring 7,000 years before the Middle Egyptian texts, again pointing to approximately 9000 BC or 11,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>.

## Evidence from the Giza Plateau

### The Great Pyramid of Giza

The Great Pyramid, a unique and extraordinary structure, presents intriguing anomalies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Acoustic Properties:** Its subterranean chamber, cut from solid bedrock, exhibits curious acoustic effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:50">[02:20:50]</a>. An experiment demonstrated an opera singer's voice from the King's Chamber could be heard in the subterranean chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:30">[02:21:30]</a>.
*   **Lost Summit:** Originally standing at 481 feet tall, the Great Pyramid lost about 30 feet of its height, possibly during an earthquake around 1301 AD, which also removed its facing stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.
*   **Precessional Numbers and Earth Dimensions:** When its original height is multiplied by 43,200 (a precessional number derived from the Earth's 25,920-year axial precession cycle, where 1 degree shifts every 72 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>), it yields the polar radius of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. Similarly, its base perimeter multiplied by the same number gives the equatorial circumference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This implies advanced knowledge of Earth's dimensions and astronomical cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.
*   **Alignment:** The Great Pyramid is almost perfectly aligned to True North, within 3/60ths of a single degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>, indicating precise astronomical knowledge in its construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.
*   **Dual Dating:** The alignment of shafts within the Great Pyramid's chambers (King's and Queen's) points to significant stars at approximately 4,500 years ago (the conventional Egyptian dating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. However, the ground pattern of the three major pyramids on the Giza plateau, which perfectly mirrors Orion's Belt, aligns with the sky as it appeared roughly 12,500 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:54">[01:38:54]</a>. This suggests the site itself was sacred and laid out much earlier, with the Dynastic Egyptians "finishing off the job" and incorporating their own astronomical knowledge into the existing structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### The Great Sphinx of Giza

The Sphinx may also be a multi-phase monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:02">[02:25:02]</a>.
*   **Water Erosion:** Geologist Robert Schoch argues that the severe weathering on the Sphinx and its enclosure is due to precipitation-induced erosion, suggesting a long period of heavy rainfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:54">[02:32:54]</a>. This climate pattern existed 12,000 years ago, not during the conventional Dynastic Egyptian period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:43">[02:35:43]</a>.
*   **Astronomical Alignment:** The Sphinx faces perfectly due East, aligning with the sunrise on the Spring Equinox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:42">[02:41:42]</a>. Due to Earth's precession, this alignment would have seen the constellation of Leo rising behind the sun around 12,000 years ago, matching the Sphinx's leonine form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>. Proponents suggest the original Sphinx was a lion, later re-carved into a human head by the Dynastic Egyptians, which explains the disproportionate head size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>.

## Evidence for a [[Ancient Technologies and Civilizations | Lost Civilization]]

### The Indus Valley Civilization

The Indus Valley Civilization, dating back 5,000 years, was unknown until its accidental discovery during railway construction in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. It possessed a fully developed written script that remains untranslated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. A particular seal, the Pasupati seal, depicts a figure in an advanced yoga position, suggesting thousands of years of prior development of yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, hinting at a much older, unrecognized culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### Underwater Archaeology

Much of Earth's landmass that was above water during the last Ice Age is now submerged due to sea level rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. An estimated 27 million square kilometers (about 10 million square miles, comparable to Europe and China combined) were submerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. This includes vast continental shelves, which have seen minimal archaeological exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Yonaguni (Japan):** A giant stone circle off Yonaguni in the Ryukyu Islands, 30 meters underwater, is calculated to have been submerged for 12,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **Mahabalipuram (India):** Enormous underwater structures off the coast of Mahabalipuram in southeast India are consistent with a "fully formed city" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **Malta Cart Ruts:** Parallel tracks cut into bedrock, resembling railway tracks, extend underwater off Malta, indicating submergence for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:18">[05:11:18]</a>. Malta was connected to Sicily during the Ice Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

### Ancient Maps

Certain ancient maps, like the Oronteus Finaeus map (1531), depict [[antarcticas_hidden_history_and_potential_lush_past | Antarctica]] long before its official discovery in 1820 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. These maps, copied from much older sources, also show Antarctica's coastline as it would have looked during the last Ice Age, without its ice cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. This suggests a civilization capable of exploring and mapping the Earth with precise longitudes at a time far earlier than conventional history allows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.

## Cataclysmic Events: The Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis

The Younger Dryas period (approximately 12,800 to 11,600 years ago) marks a dramatic and sudden return to Ice Age conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Onset (12,800 years ago):** The Earth experienced a sudden, catastrophic drop in climate, becoming as cold as the peak Ice Age, yet simultaneously saw a significant release of meltwater into the oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This is explained by the hypothesis that large comet fragments impacted the North American and European ice caps, instantly melting vast quantities of ice and disrupting ocean currents like the Gulf Stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>. This event also led to the extinction of most Ice Age megafauna, such as woolly mammoths and saber-tooth tigers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   **End (11,600 years ago):** Just as abruptly, global temperatures rose by 10 degrees in a few hundred years, accompanied by rapid sea level rise (Meltwater Pulse 1B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. This could be attributed to further comet impacts, this time into the ocean, generating massive water vapor that created a greenhouse effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

These global cataclysms provide a context for the destruction and subsequent forgetting of an advanced [[Ancient Technologies and Civilizations | ancient civilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## The Role of Psychedelics in Ancient and Modern Society

[[the_role_of_psychedelics_in_ancient_and_modern_society | Psychedelics]] may have played a fundamental role in the development of [[Ancient Technologies and Civilizations | ancient cultures]] and the acquisition of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Ancient Usage:** Unlike modern societies, many ancient cultures deeply integrated [[the_role_of_psychedelics_in_ancient_and_modern_society | psychedelics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Examples include the Eleusinian Mysteries in Ancient Greece, where initiates consumed a brew (possibly containing LSD-like fungus) that induced profound experiences and revelations about reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Enhancement:** [[the_role_of_psychedelics_in_ancient_and_modern_society | Psychedelics]] like psilocybin promote neuroplasticity, stimulating new neuron growth in the brain and potentially increasing intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. Terence McKenna's "Stoned Ape Hypothesis" suggests [[the_role_of_psychedelics_in_ancient_and_modern_society | psychedelics]] could have been the trigger for a surge in human consciousness and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Breaking Mental Patterns:** These substances can disrupt rigid, negative thought patterns common in depression, offering new perspectives and "ego death" that reconnects individuals to a larger sense of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Acquisition:** Individuals like Kary Mullis (PCR test inventor), Steve Jobs (Apple co-founder), and Francis Crick (DNA double helix co-discoverer) attributed significant scientific and creative breakthroughs to their [[the_role_of_psychedelics_in_ancient_and_modern_society | psychedelic]] experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. This suggests [[the_role_of_psychedelics_in_ancient_and_modern_society | psychedelics]] may facilitate a "quantum leap" in knowledge by accessing alternative states of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Spiritual and Transpersonal Experiences:** [[the_role_of_psychedelics_in_ancient_and_modern_society | Psychedelics]] can lead to encounters with entities, often described as part-human, part-animal (theanthropic), common in ancient art like Egyptian depictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. These experiences are interpreted as direct contact with "the Divine" or access to other dimensions of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. They can alleviate the fear of death by fostering a sense of continued consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on Art and Technology:** The sudden emergence of extraordinary cave art 100,000 years ago or less, featuring geometric patterns and theanthropic figures, aligns with typical psychedelic visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. The ability to coordinate massive projects like the pyramids might have been aided by non-conventional communication methods like telepathy, possibly enhanced by altered states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## Challenges to Mainstream Archaeology

Graham Hancock and his colleagues face significant opposition from the archaeological establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>, who often deny access to sites and dismiss alternative theories as unscientific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Exploration:** Archaeology is often driven by accidental finds and has minimally explored vast areas like flooded continental shelves, the Amazon rainforest, and the Sahara Desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Definition of Evidence:** Critics argue that archaeology sets itself up as the sole arbiter of what constitutes evidence, dismissing geological and astronomical findings that contradict established timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
*   **Ad Hominem Attacks:** Hancock reports being accused of spreading racism, white supremacy, misogyny, and anti-Semitism in response to his Netflix series *Ancient Apocalypse*, despite the series never mentioning race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. These accusations stem from his reporting of indigenous myths mentioning "white-skinned bearded strangers" who brought knowledge after a cataclysm, a concept misinterpreted as promoting white supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Hancock emphasizes that such myths, found globally, focus on the preservation of knowledge after a cataclysm, not on racial characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

The [[Debates on the history of ancient civilizations | debates on the history of ancient civilizations]] highlight a clash between rigid academic dogma and interdisciplinary evidence, suggesting that much of humanity's story, especially from the Ice Age, remains undiscovered and misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

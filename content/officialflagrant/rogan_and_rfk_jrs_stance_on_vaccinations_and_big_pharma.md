## Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Joe Rogan

[[rfk_jrs_campaign_and_political_beliefs | Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]] is described as a "man of the people" and the Kennedys are perceived by some as "folks of the working class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. However, there is expressed discomfort with this portrayal, citing instances of young Kennedys' opulent lifestyle, such as one claiming "the airport's named after me" when denied entry to a nightclub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

[[rfk_jrs_campaign_and_political_beliefs | Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]] went on [[rogan_controversy_and_media_portrayal | Joe Rogan's podcast]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> and is noted for "taking shots at everybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

## Stance on Vaccinations

On [[rogan_controversy_and_media_portrayal | Joe Rogan's podcast]], [[rfk_jrs_campaign_and_political_beliefs | Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]] reportedly suggested that the COVID vaccine "might be a little fugaze" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

A personal stance was shared regarding child vaccination:
*   Preference is given to "God's Little immune system" to do its job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   Modern medicine would only be considered if it's "very clear that we need to get modern medicine involved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   "Battle-tested" vaccines, such as those that are 2,000 years old (referencing stoic advice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> or flu shots that have been around for years, are acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   Skepticism exists towards "new vaccines" because they "just hasn't been battle tested to be battle tested" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   Analogy: People buy the first iPhone to "get the kinks out of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, implying "some kinks in the latest COVID vaccine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   There is reluctance to get the booster shot due to "all these problems" heard about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, opting to trust the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

## Erosion of Trust in Institutions

The discussion touched on the erosion of trust in institutions, which is not solely due to misinformation but also the institutions' own actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. An example given was the COVID vaccine being promoted as effective, but "a few months later it doesn't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>, leading to a loss of faith in their pronouncements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:10">[02:06:10]</a>. It is argued that institutions must re-instill faith by providing full information and engaging in conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:24">[02:06:24]</a>.

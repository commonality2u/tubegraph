During an interview, Donald Trump recounted details surrounding an assassination attempt he survived. He referred to the event as an "assassination attempt" where he was "hit head shot" but survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:53">[10:51:53]</a>. The incident occurred at a rally, where Trump intended to finish his speech but was surrounded by Secret Service agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:57">[12:56:57]</a>.

## The Incident and Immediate Aftermath

Trump described the moment he was hit as one of "total realization," not a "surreal experience" like some traumatic events can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. He knew exactly what had happened, stating he "got shot in the ear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. The Secret Service believed he had been shot all over due to the significant amount of blood, as getting shot in the ear is the "bloodiest place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. He noted that if he hadn't turned, he "wouldn't be doing this right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.

The incident was described as a "horrible experience" in most ways, but also "beautiful" in some, hoping that the firefighter, Corey, who was killed, is "protected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>. Three individuals were affected: one killed, and two "very badly hurt" who were not expected to live but were saved by "country doctors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. Trump's son, Don Jr., who is a "great shooter," commented on the 130-yard distance from the shooter, equating it to a "one foot putt" for a decent shooter, implying it was "almost impossible to miss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. This event led Don Jr. to become "more religious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>. Upon arrival at Butler Hospital, the doctor told Trump he was the "luckiest man" he had ever met, advising him to "immediately go out and buy a lotto ticket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.

Trump's "attitude" towards the danger was "it is what it is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. He chose to return to the location, believing it was important, and over 100,000 people attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. His opening line when returning to the stage was, "As I was saying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>, which received a "crazy" reaction from the crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

## Investigation and Suspected Parties

Trump revealed "breaking news" about the investigation into the shooters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. One shooter had "three or so cell phones" that the FBI has never been able to open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>. The other shooter had "three apps," believed to be foreign-based, which also haven't been opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>. Additionally, the second shooter had six cell phones that remain unopened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>. Trump noted that Apple phones are difficult to open, but the FBI was able to access phones of "J6 people" quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>. He believes that given an "assassination attempt on a former president," these phones and apps should be opened for "National Security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>.

When asked directly who he thought was responsible, Trump speculated that Iran could be involved, citing an "open threat" they have against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:16:00">[30:16:00]</a>. He suggested that if the current president were "a real president," he would issue a strong warning that if "anybody shoots a former president," the country would be "bomb[ed]...into Oblivion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:22:00">[30:22:00]</a>. He also mentioned taking "hundreds of billions of dollars from China" through tariffs, which could create enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:29:00">[31:29:00]</a>.

## The Dangers of the Presidency

Trump compared the risks of the presidency to other dangerous professions, noting that a "substantial percent" of presidents face assassination or attempts, "way higher than we realize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>. He cited historical examples like Lincoln, Kennedy, McKinley, and Garfield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:00">[27:32:00]</a>. He emphasized that being president is a "very dangerous business profession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>.

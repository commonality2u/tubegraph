The "Squid Game" video marked a significant milestone for the channel, representing a substantial investment and a groundbreaking use of new production techniques for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Conception and Investment
The idea for the Squid Game video was inspired by an individual from Dubai, who hired a private investigator and flew to North Carolina just to deliver a list of video ideas. While the ideas were initially dismissed as not good, including opening a free gas station, the Squid Game concept, which was written out by him, was ultimately used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:14">[02:22:14]</a>.

The project involved a "mega Giga crazy Trend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:34">[02:23:34]</a> and a significant financial commitment. Prior to "Squid Game," the most spent on a video was around $2 million, but this project cost $4.2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:43">[02:23:43]</a>. It was an "all hands on deck" effort, with the team scrapping all other videos and dedicating 30 minutes of "heart and soul" to its production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:51">[02:23:51]</a>.

## Production Challenges
The video was produced in a challenging 45-day timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:52">[02:25:52]</a>, with 150 people working on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:54">[02:25:54]</a>. Being in North Carolina, the team faced a lack of traditional studio space, necessitating the use of unconventional locations such as a rodeo station (where cows are wrangled) for the "Red Light, Green Light" set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>. They also sought out churches for sets due to the scarcity of warehouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a>.

The project was the first time the channel extensively used CGI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:37">[02:23:37]</a>. For the "Red Light, Green Light" game, the sky and everything above the "blue" line was entirely CGI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:41">[02:29:41]</a>. This required installing a grid system with angled lights to mimic sunlight within the studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:48">[02:29:48]</a>. The team also used black screens and blue screens for various effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:56">[02:32:56]</a>.

Technological hurdles included managing 456 individual devices for "killing" contestants (using squibs that created smoke) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:06">[02:26:06]</a>. On the first filming day, the Wi-Fi system in the stadium crashed due to too many devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:15">[02:26:15]</a>. This incident added $700,000 to the budget, as each of the 456 participants was given $1,000 to return the next day after the system was upgraded to handle the load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>. A custom app was developed to remotely "kill" players by triggering their squibs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:13">[02:28:13]</a>. The squibs were initially red but changed to another color to avoid looking like blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>.

The "Glass Bridge" scene involved a real foam pit for the fall, but the depth below the pit was a dramatic CGI enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:12">[02:36:12]</a>. For the final game, "Musical Chairs" was chosen for its simplicity and universal understanding, avoiding the need for complex explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:41">[02:39:41]</a>.

## Impact and Reception
The Squid Game video was a massive success, breaking world records for views on a single YouTube video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:46">[02:24:46]</a>. The channel gained 10 million subscribers in the English channel alone the month it was released, and across all platforms, it amassed 25 million new subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>.

To build hype, the team promoted the video on TikTok by showing parts of the sets, garnering 30 million views on those preview clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Millions of people were refreshing the channel, waiting for it to go live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:29">[02:25:29]</a>.

Despite the intense production and challenges, the video's success reinforced the understanding that universal human emotions translate across cultures, as the "Squid Game" video, like other top-performing videos, resonated similarly in dubbed versions across various languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:55">[02:43:55]</a>. The actual Korean show *Squid Game* cost approximately $9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>.

## Storytelling and Memes
The channel understands the importance of [[Content creation dynamics on platforms like YouTube and TikTok | memes]] in driving online culture and views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:7:29">[02:7:29]</a>. They avoid forcing memeable moments, recognizing that organic virality is key, as demonstrated by the success of "Baby Yoda" from *The Mandalorian* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:7:35">[02:7:35]</a>. They also note that a movie like *Morbius* saw re-release success due to its viral meme status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:19">[02:28:19]</a>. The channel's content strategy emphasizes understanding human psychology rather than just optimizing for algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:13">[02:49:13]</a>.

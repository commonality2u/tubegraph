New York City has been a pivotal force in [[Personal insights on lifestyle and managing fame | Casey Neistat's]] personal life and creative endeavors, shaping his identity, resilience, and unique filmmaking style. From his earliest struggles to his renowned career as a filmmaker and YouTuber, the city has served as both his muse and his crucible.

## A Dream and a Struggle: Early Years in New York City

Casey Neistat's aspiration to move to New York City was a childhood dream, inspired by films like "Big" and its depiction of the city as a magical place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. His first attempt to move to New York City was marked by extreme financial hardship. He lived in an SRO (Single Room Occupancy) in a halfway house, bribing the front desk with a $100 bill and cigarettes for a room that had no bathroom or kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. His life involved taking his young child to a shared bathroom often covered in blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

After a temporary stay in a dilapidated mobile home in Connecticut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>, he embarked on a five-year plan to move to New York, eventually relocating in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. He lived in a tiny studio apartment in Alphabet City, so small that his futon couldn't lie flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. The early months were "really, really brutal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>, with Casey working as a bike messenger whose cell phone bill exceeded his $270 paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>. This period, despite its challenges, taught him self-sufficiency and the ability to "figure it out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.

## The Trauma and Defining Moment of 9/11

Just ten days after moving into his apartment on Rector Street, the 9/11 attacks occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>. His apartment windows exploded, and he vividly recalls the chaos outside, including a person trying to cover human remains with sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. He got on his bike, capturing some footage while biking away from the second explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>. He and his brother Van went to St. Vincent's Hospital to help, where Casey found himself directing police to manage traffic for ambulances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>. He describes watching the towers fall in slow motion, feeling it was "CGI before CGI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

This traumatic event solidified his resolve to stay in New York, refusing his father's and mentor's pleas to return to Connecticut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. He felt if he could "make it through this," he would be "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. The shared experience of 9/11 created an intense bond with the city and its residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>. This period of [[influence_of_historical_events_and_figures_on_personal_views | historical events]] also cemented his understanding of the city's resilience.

## New York City as a Creative Muse

New York City serves as Casey's primary muse, constantly inspiring his creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>. He loves to make films and attributes everything he has to the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:15">[02:01:15]</a>. He finds daily "stories" everywhere, even in mundane activities like someone changing a garbage bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>. His vlogs often feature authentic interactions with New Yorkers, showcasing the city's unique character.

He highlights the paradox of New Yorkers being "harsh on the outside" but "so good on the inside," appreciating their honesty and directness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:47">[02:01:47]</a>. He believes that the city's demanding nature attracts individuals who have "fought to be here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:35">[02:03:35]</a>, fostering a community of resilient and resourceful people.

Casey's deep connection to the city is evident in his daily routines, waking up early to run for hours through the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:53">[01:59:53]</a>. He famously tries to run across the Brooklyn Bridge without seeing a single person, achieving it three times in one winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:06">[02:00:06]</a>.

## Returning to New York

After a period living in Los Angeles, Casey felt like a "hollow man" and a "shell of a human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:16">[01:57:16]</a>. He felt like a "traitor" for not being in New York during the pandemic, believing he had a "unique ability to communicate" the reality of the city during that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:43">[01:57:43]</a>.

His return to New York in September was emotional, bringing him to tears when someone yelled "King of New York" while he was riding his skateboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:32">[02:00:32]</a>. He describes the city as a "woman, a partner, something you've wanted your whole life and then you just get it and it's better than you imagine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:55">[02:00:55]</a>.

Despite the city's constant changes, including the gentrification of areas like the Lower East Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:52">[02:05:52]</a>, Casey embraces it, having seen his own neighborhood in the East Village transform from a "drug haven to Japanese restaurants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:12">[02:06:12]</a>. He believes New York City now feels better than ever, even if it's "a little bit nasty" after the changes brought by COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:59">[02:04:59]</a>. His philosophy remains that the world is "created by people that are no smarter than you," and he thrives by stepping outside conventional rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:47">[02:20:47]</a>. He states he is "never leaving this city" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:48">[02:09:48]</a>.

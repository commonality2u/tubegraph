That Mexican OT's journey in the music industry has seen a notable evolution, moving from a traditional rap persona to embracing a distinct cowboy image that reflects his authentic self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>. This shift has not only broadened his musical style but also resonated deeply with his growing fanbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>.

## Embracing Authenticity
Initially, That Mexican OT admits he would dress in typical rap attire, such as jeans and Jordans, because he was "trying to look like a rapper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>. The transition to his current cowboy persona began when he "just gave up on it" and decided to wear what he wanted, out of a sense of laziness and a desire for comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>. This seemingly simple decision to embrace his authentic self, rooted in his Texas upbringing and cowboy lifestyle, unexpectedly led to a surge in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>.

## The Cowboy Image
The cowboy persona is now a core part of his identity. He considers his cowboy hat and boots to be his "chain," symbolizing his unique style over traditional jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:39">[01:33:39]</a>. He consciously saves money rather than buying expensive chains because he believes his music speaks for itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>. When traveling, like during a trip to Atlanta, he presents himself in denim shorts, a wife-beater, boots, and his cowboy hat, which often prompts reactions of curiosity from those unfamiliar with his style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:44">[01:31:44]</a>.

## Musical Versatility
This personal shift has also influenced his music. While primarily a rapper, he has ventured into country songs, enjoying the fun and different "characters" he can embody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. He jokingly states that he doesn't even know how to rap, he "just rhyme words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. This confidence allows him to experiment with sounds and genres, as evidenced by tracks like "Cowboy Killer" which incorporates blues elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. Having rapped since he was four years old, his deep musical fluency enables him to comfortably rap in different styles and explore new artistic avenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:58">[04:56:58]</a>, considering it "unlocking new characters every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>.

## Overcoming Self-Doubt
That Mexican OT shared that he used to "despise and hated everything of myself" due to negative opinions from family and peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>. He recalled people questioning his rapping in school and disliking him as a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:27">[01:36:27]</a>. This period of self-doubt lasted until he was around 20 or 21, when he made the conscious decision to "believe in myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:46">[01:36:46]</a>. This newfound self-acceptance aligned with his embrace of the cowboy image, demonstrating a powerful connection between personal authenticity and professional success.

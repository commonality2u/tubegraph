Mixed martial artist Dillon Danis recently provided insights into his preparation for the upcoming boxing match against [[logan_pauls_fight_against_dillon_danis_and_its_implications | Logan Paul]]. Danis addressed his physical condition, strategic approach, and broader career ambitions during a podcast appearance.

## Physical Condition and Training
Danis noted that he is currently in good physical shape, a contrast to a previous appearance where he was "drunk off bender" in Miami [00:00:43]. He expressed surprise that others doubted his physical readiness [00:02:46]. He stated he has been training consistently, mentioning shadow boxing in the mirror [01:1:43] and training at Gotham [01:47:00]. Danis also revealed he is a 170-pound fighter who had to gain weight for this fight, currently weighing around 204 pounds, with the goal of fighting at 195 pounds [03:09:11]. He observed that [[logan_pauls_allegations_against_floyd_mayweather | Logan Paul]] has "more size and more strength," while he is "more girthy" and would "last longer" [01:11:13]. He also commented on [[logan_pauls_allegations_against_floyd_mayweather | Logan Paul's]] physique, suggesting that being "that tall and have that muscle mass is almost impossible," and that [[logan_pauls_allegations_against_floyd_mayweather | Logan Paul's]] legs are "very skinny" [00:33:44].

## Strategic Approach to the Fight
Danis is confident in his ability to "knock this kid out easy" [01:27:00]. He emphasizes his Jiu-Jitsu background, stating he can use it in the fight, even if the rules are boxing [01:16:15]. He has practiced chokes and demonstrated them during the interview, claiming he could put someone "to sleep immediately" [00:05:43]. He believes he has "more ways to win" than [[logan_pauls_allegations_against_floyd_mayweather | Logan Paul]] and that "power is probably [his] strength" [02:45:00]. He also prides himself on his resilience and toughness, declaring he will not "take a [__] backwards step" [02:57:00].

Despite the boxing rules, Danis insists that Jiu-Jitsu will factor into the fight, suggesting that if he chokes [[logan_pauls_allegations_against_floyd_mayweather | Logan Paul]] unconscious, no one can stop him [01:25:00]. He referenced a "Ground Brown" strategy [01:13:00] and believes [[logan_pauls_allegations_against_floyd_mayweather | Logan Paul]] picks Jiu-Jitsu guys who have "never boxed before" [03:11:00] for an advantage.

### Influence and Sparring
Danis revealed he trains by himself, primarily through shadow boxing [01:43:00]. He considers [[dillon_danis_experiences_and_training_with_conor_mcgregor | Conor McGregor]] a significant influence, highlighting McGregor's understanding of "marketing" and "mindsets" in fighting [04:38:00]. He described being "super [__] nervous" before [[dillon_danis_experiences_and_training_with_conor_mcgregor | Conor McGregor's]] Nate Diaz fight but was reassured by McGregor's unwavering confidence [04:17:00]. Danis appreciates McGregor's loyalty, noting that McGregor "doesn't need to defend" him but does, which he values as a mark of a true friend [04:47:00].

He also confirmed a recent "intense" sparring session with Alex Pereira, a light heavyweight [03:57:00]. Despite Pereira being a formidable opponent, Danis claims he "didn't take a back step" and went six rounds at a "high pace" [04:14:00]. He stated that Pereira helped him train for this fight, driving from Connecticut [03:38:00].

## Fight Promotion and Public Perception
Danis acknowledges his controversial public persona. He claims he "didn't change" his personality and remains a "same [__] talking [__]" [03:52:00], which he believes is why the internet has "rallied behind" him [03:35:00]. He contrasts this with [[logan_pauls_allegations_against_floyd_mayweather | Logan Paul]], whom he believes "tries to be a good guy when he's a bad guy" and "doesn't take" jokes well [03:55:00].

He discussed the lawsuit initiated by [[logan_pauls_personal_life_and_relationship_dynamics | Logan Paul's]] fianc√©e, Nina Agdal, calling it "corny" [03:34:00]. He argues that she is a "public figure" and that his actions were a way to "sell the fight" [00:44:00]. He stated he made her "more popular than she's ever been" [04:50:00]. He also recounted a past incident with a bouncer, where he was injured, drunk, and on crutches, claiming he was "jumped" by six or seven guys [02:5:00].

Danis feels that he has done "all the work to Big up this fight" [03:19:00] and doesn't get a "piece" of the pay-per-view [01:05:00]. He feels he is in a "tough situation" because pulling out would make him "look like oh I don't want to fight," but there is "no upside" to the fight itself [03:01:00]. He believes the public views the lawsuit as "corny" and that it sets a "bad president for Fighters going forward" [03:02:00].

## Future Ambitions
Danis's ultimate career goal is to become a UFC champion at 170 pounds [03:39:00]. He states he could even make 155 pounds but worries his head might be "too big for 55" [03:15:00]. He sees the current influencer boxing scene as a means to an end, preferring to fight in MMA because he could "choke these guys out in 2 seconds" [03:58:00]. He believes that winning against [[logan_pauls_allegations_against_floyd_mayweather | Logan Paul]] would open doors for his UFC ambition [03:55:00].

He dismisses the idea of further influencer fights, stating "there's no point" [08:00:00], and mentions that [[jake_pauls_boxing_career | Jake Paul]] and [[ksis_thoughts_on_jake_paul | KSI]] are "fighting for [his] rights" if he wins [08:01:00]. He views [[logan_pauls_allegations_against_floyd_mayweather | Logan Paul]] as a "phenomenal athlete" but lacking technique compared to [[jake_pauls_boxing_career | Jake Paul]] [02:22:00]. Danis believes he will achieve his goal of winning a world championship, stating it's "better than drugs" and that he "can't wait for it again" [04:02:00].

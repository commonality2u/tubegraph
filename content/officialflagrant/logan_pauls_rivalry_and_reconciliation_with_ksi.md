Logan Paul and KSI, two prominent internet personalities, engaged in a significant rivalry that began in the online content creation space and escalated into a series of highly publicized boxing matches, eventually culminating in a business partnership.

## The Genesis of the Rivalry

The beef between Logan Paul and KSI was described as "1,000% real" and not staged for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:03">[02:25:03]</a>. It originated from their competition in daily vlogging, where both were rapidly gaining popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:18">[02:25:18]</a>. Logan Paul admitted that the competition "bred this animosity" between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:32">[02:25:32]</a>.

## Boxing as a Catalyst for Change

The rivalry intensified and transitioned into the boxing ring. Following a controversy, Logan Paul recounts that his "British counterpart KSI called me out for a boxing match" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:27">[02:35:27]</a>. This opportunity for a [[logan_pauls_boxing_career | boxing match]] was seen by many, including Logan, as a lifeline for his career, effectively providing a "potential redemption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:33">[02:35:33]</a>. He credits KSI with "saving his career" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:02">[02:36:02]</a>.

Their second boxing match saw KSI defeat Logan Paul, but Logan states that the loss didn't affect him due to personal growth he had undergone, particularly after the Japan controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:32">[02:37:32]</a>. Logan reflects that he has learned to embrace losses as learning opportunities, not true failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. This newfound perspective allowed him to see similarities between himself and KSI, noting they are "like the same person across the pond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:11">[02:38:11]</a>.

## Reconciliation and Business Partnership

The turning point for their relationship came when Logan Paul appeared on KSI's podcast or show to promote KSI's album <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:22">[02:38:22]</a>. Logan expressed surprise that KSI accepted the invitation, but stated he didn't take any of their past "quals" personally due to his significant personal growth since their last fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:51">[02:38:51]</a>.

This reconciliation ultimately led to an "incredible business move" with an "incredible story": the creation of Prime Hydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:17">[02:39:17]</a>. Logan notes that KSI is an "amazing partner" and that their dynamic is a "weird yin yang thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:25">[02:39:25]</a>. He has a personal goal to one day say that while KSI saved his career, he "made him a billionaire" through their joint venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:54">[02:39:54]</a>.

## Future Dynamics

Despite their strong partnership, Logan Paul expresses discomfort with the idea of KSI fighting his brother, Jake Paul. This is due to his close business relationship with KSI and the familial bond with Jake, making it a complicated situation where he doesn't want to revisit the animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:31">[02:39:31]</a>.

## Gilly & Keeves Special

A new special by Gilly & Keeves was announced, available for purchase through their website, [[gilliancues.tv | gilliancues.tv]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Priced at $10, it includes both special sketches and a live performance segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The sketches are noted for being well-produced, not "cheaply shot," and even feature elements like an airplane in the first one, offering good value for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The special was released at 8 PM on the day the podcast episode came out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The total production cost for the special was approximately $270,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, with cast members receiving some payment upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.

The hosts were instrumental in encouraging the creation of the special, with one suggesting the team talk to [[comedy_and_comedian_interactions_and_dynamics | Andrew Schultz]] for motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Schultz reportedly pushed them to do it, calling it a "genius idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

### "If Guy Fieri Had PTSD" Sketch

One of the sketches featured in the special is titled "If Guy Fieri had PTSD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. This sketch was filmed relatively recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.

[!NOTE|Production Insights]
*   **Filming Environment**: During filming, old people in a nearby restaurant mistakenly thought the character was Guy Fieri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   **Acting**: The host praised Shane Gillis's acting in the sketch, noting his potential for dramatic roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
*   **Editing**: John is credited as the brilliant editor responsible for the sketch's pacing and music use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. He works a day job, and there's a playful plea for viewers to buy the special so he can quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   **Fight Scene**: A fight scene in the sketch was described as "tough to film" and "very uncomfortable" because it involved wrestling a stranger for about an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

### Creative Process and Influences

The hosts view Shane Gillis's sketches as among the best currently available, comparing them favorably to other popular sketch shows like "I Think You Should Leave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

Shane's comedic writing style is described as naturally visual, similar to [[comedy_and_standup | Dave Chappelle's]] approach to jokes, where a bit can easily translate into a sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. An example given is a joke from the beginning of Shane's special, which functions as a standalone sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

There's a desire to expand into a "Chappelle Show" format, combining [[comedy_and_standup | stand-up]] with sketches, ideally with more funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. The idea is to build this up on YouTube, though paying all collaborators fairly is a challenge if the content is released for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

Shane's sketches are also praised for their natural diversity, featuring comedians like Reggie Conquest and Anthony Moore, without it feeling forced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

Francis Ellis has been featured in a few sketches, appearing as a preacher/priest in the first season and a pilot and judge in the current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>. The team intentionally avoided including major celebrities in the special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>, though they would make an exception for someone like Leonardo DiCaprio if he genuinely enjoyed their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

[!QUOTE|Shane Gillis on fan encounters]
"He's the only famous dude that I've seen that actively will like if you're I'm not advocating this but like if people are around and they're like can we get a picture he's like oh yeah hell yeah like immediately no hesitation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>.

The process of creating a sketch, from filming to release, takes about a day per sketch, although the entire special was filmed in July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

Shane Gillis recounted an experience where he did an impression of Nate Diaz on Joe Rogan's podcast, and later, while at dinner with Diaz, Diaz confronted him, stating, "I don't sound like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. Shane stated he hasn't done the impression since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:59">[01:18:59]</a>.# Comedy Sketches and Production Insights

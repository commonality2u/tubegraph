When forensic health professionals evaluate stalking, four key items are considered: the nature of the relationship between the stalker and victim, the stalker's motivations, the stalker's psychological, psychopathological, and social realities, and the victim's psychological and social vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01"></a>. Modern forensic investigations have been made considerably more efficient by technology, particularly internet search history, which can unveil aspects of a suspect's personality that might otherwise remain hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01"></a>.

## Case Study: Stephen McDaniel

Stephen McDaniel, 25, became a person of interest in the disappearance of his neighbor, 24-year-old Lauren Giddings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01"></a>. McDaniel's internet search history revealed searches for violent and torture-themed pornography, as well as multiple variations of "how to commit sexual assault" and "how to molest sleeping girl," which forensics identified as an overt sign of desensitization to sexual activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01"></a>. This desensitization can build a tolerance to traditional ideas of sex, leading individuals to seek more potent stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01"></a>. This trajectory eventually led McDaniel to plan and execute actions he viewed online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01"></a>.

### Initial Police Contact and Discovery of Evidence

After Lauren's torso was discovered near her apartment complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:01"></a>, police began conducting interviews with neighbors, including Stephen McDaniel. He was first interviewed by local news, unaware of the discovery of Lauren's remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:01"></a>. His reaction to the news of a body being recovered was described as "most likely a genuine reaction disguised as another," suggesting fear and shock over evidence discovery, masked as sorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:01"></a>.

Police interviewed McDaniel at 11:50 a.m., where he appeared fidgety and apprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:01"></a>. During this interview, he asserted he was a virgin saving himself for marriage, but detectives noted scratch marks on his face and stomach, which he claimed were self-inflicted during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:01"></a>. He became the prime suspect and reluctantly consented to a search of his apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:01"></a>.

The search revealed a collection of swords, guns, stockpiled provisions, and a mask made of women's underwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:01"></a>. The most significant discovery was a pack of condoms; when asked why he had them if he was celibate, McDaniel confessed to stealing them from another apartment, providing probable cause for his arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:01"></a>.

## Stephen McDaniel's Interrogation

McDaniel's interrogation began just after 11 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:01"></a>. His demeanor shifted to a "monotone dialogue and lifeless demeanor" on the drive to the station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:01"></a>. This behavior, described as an "abnormal and extremely creepy character," was mystifying and dictated the pace of the interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:01"></a>.

### Interrogation Techniques and Stephen's Responses

Detectives employed various [[interrogation_techniques_and_strategy | interrogation strategies]]:

*   **Initial Aggression and Psychological Pressure**: The detective attempted to increase psychological pressure by closing the distance and commanding eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:01"></a>. However, McDaniel's haunting gaze unnerved the detective, causing him to look away and reset his postureâ€”a rare occurrence that can boost suspect confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:01"></a>.
*   **Subtle Pressure**: The detective retreated from his aggressive approach, asking trivial questions before subtly attempting to ramp up pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:01"></a>. McDaniel maintained his non-committal responses, primarily "I don't know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:01"></a>.
*   **Attacking Character**: After 20 minutes of no wavering from McDaniel, the detective took a "distinctly aggressive approach," attacking McDaniel's character to try and coax him out of his act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:01"></a>. This included referencing McDaniel's prior media interview and calling him a "sorry piece of s**t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:01"></a>.
*   **Second Detective's Aggression**: A second detective entered, immediately employing a similar aggressive strategy, bypassing rapport development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:01"></a>. He used rhetorical questions about McDaniel's gun ownership and infrequent visits to Lauren's apartment to highlight inconsistencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:01"></a>.
*   **Psychological Battle of Attrition**: The second detective closed distance and locked eye contact, aiming to "crack the suspect's fortified barrier" through a prolonged gaze, a "psychological battle of attrition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:01"></a>.
*   **Futility Technique**: The detective claimed "There's blood in your apartment, Stephen. You didn't get it all up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:01"></a>. This "futility technique" is used to convince a subject that resistance is useless due to overwhelming evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:01"></a>. However, McDaniel had dismembered Lauren in *her* apartment, not his, so the bluff was called <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:01"></a>.
*   **Shift to Sympathetic Approach**: The detective shifted from confrontational to sympathetic, attempting to create a connection and offer McDaniel a "socially acceptable reason for the crime" (e.g., unsupportive parents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:01"></a>. This failed immediately as McDaniel rejected the premise of unsupportive parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:01"></a>.
*   **Non-Confrontational Questions**: For almost 30 minutes, the lead detective asked non-confrontational questions, hoping to change McDaniel's demeanor, but it had no effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:01"></a>. McDaniel maintained his "lifeless disposition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:18:01"></a>.
*   **Inducing Mental Exhaustion**: The detective repeatedly asked "Did you hurt that girl?" to which McDaniel consistently replied "no, I didn't" for 20 minutes, a possible attempt to induce mental exhaustion, but it also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:01"></a>.
*   **Belittling and Humiliation**: Abandoning the pursuit of admission, the lead detective resorted to belittling and humiliating McDaniel, likely out of frustration and certainty of his guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:17:01"></a>. This included questioning his social life and claiming his own family called him "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:33:01"></a>. This behavior, in any other circumstance, would be considered cruel, but the context of the suspected horrific crime can strip away normal empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:01"></a>.

### Outcome and Evidence

The entire [[interrogation_techniques_and_suspect_behavior | interrogation]], lasting over two hours, yielded nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:15:01"></a>. McDaniel's "catatonic performance" was so abnormal that interrogators were at a loss for a specific plan of attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:01"></a>. However, when his mother came to speak with him, he "immediately snapped out of the zombie-like character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:54:01"></a>.

Despite the lack of a confession during the interrogation, the evidence was irrefutable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:24:01"></a>. Hundreds of pictures of Lauren and multiple video recordings from inside her apartment were found on McDaniel's flash drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:27:01"></a>. A hacksaw, marked with Lauren's blood, was discovered in the apartment complex's supply closet, and its packaging was found in McDaniel's apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:01"></a>. Confronted with this evidence, McDaniel took a plea deal to avoid the death penalty and received a life sentence without parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:47:01"></a>.

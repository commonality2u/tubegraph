The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) utilizes a highly trained [[interrogation analysis techniques | Behavioral Sciences unit]], with its subdivision of forensic psychiatry recognized globally for its excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Staff Sergeant Chris Loam, head of the analysis section for 17 years at the time of the investigation, was responsible for [[psychological_profiling_of_criminals | criminal profiling]], threat assessment, and forensic psychiatry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Role of the Behavioral Sciences Unit

The stated purpose of the Behavioral Sciences unit in [[criminal investigation and interrogation techniques | criminal investigations]] is to assess a suspect's threat level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. However, for serious crimes like rape and murder, the threat level is typically assessed long before any psychoanalysis takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. In reality, the primary goal of an investigator from this unit is to understand the suspect's character and use this knowledge to influence their reasoning and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

The OPP's Behavioral Sciences section is specifically designed to deal with unusual and irregular occurrences, such as abductions and murders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

## Interrogation Strategies

In the interrogation of Michael Rafferty, several behavioral analysis [[interrogation techniques and suspect behavior | techniques]] were employed:

### Rapport Development
Investigators initially maintain a friendly and nonchalant disposition to build rapport with the suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This approach aims to create a perception of solidarity and respect, making the suspect more likely to cooperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. By downplaying the severity of the crime, the gravity of admission is made less intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

The investigator states his role is to determine the risk and assess if the suspect would "go out and kill more people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. He emphasizes that nothing the suspect says will surprise him due to his extensive experience and knowledge of the case facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. He claims not to be upset or mad at the suspect, maintaining a neutral stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### Mental Exhaustion and Psychological Pressure
Detectives use constant dialogue and rapid questioning to keep a suspect's mind racing, preventing them from formulating lies or disassociating from the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. This methodical process aims to break down the suspect through mental exhaustion, slowly chipping away at their psychological stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

The investigator repeatedly emphasizes that the evidence is overwhelming and cannot be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. He states that the suspect's credibility is all they have left, urging them to confess to avoid being perceived in the worst possible light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

### Mutt and Jeff Technique (Good Cop Bad Cop)
This technique, also known as the "fear then relief" response, involves an immediate and extreme shift in emotion from one interrogator to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. The goal is to disorient the suspect, affecting their ability to think critically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. This state of disorientation can make compliance more likely as the suspect seeks to cope with uncertainty through a positive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.

During Rafferty's interrogation, the "bad cop" overtly expresses anger and disdain for the suspect, making graphic accusations about Tori Stafford's murder and the overwhelming [[impact of evidence and videos in criminal cases | evidence]] against him, including DNA from his car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>. He highlights Terry Lynn McClintock's confession and her willingness to cooperate without a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

### Analyzing Suspect Demeanor
Investigators closely examine a suspect's demeanor, particularly in comparison to how they might have acted during the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Michael Rafferty's behavior during his interrogation is described as a "quivering mess," acting like a helpless victim seeking sympathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This is seen as a stark contrast to his actions during the attack on Tori Stafford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

The investigator notes Rafferty's inability to eat or drink, attributing it to his "guts eating yourself up inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. His curled-up, fetal position is identified as a sign of being overwhelmed and knowing "it's over," rather than the posture of an innocent person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

During a discussion about food, Rafferty's primary concern was how his act of eating would be perceived, wanting to appear guilt-ridden rather than satisfy his hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. This internal conflict reveals his clinging to hope despite knowing his situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

> [The suspect's] primary purpose is to gain an understanding of the suspect's character and then use this knowledge to try and influence both his reasoning and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

> It's always interesting to examine a suspects demeanor while being interrogated especially compared to how they most likely were while committing their violation. The suspect here is a quivering mess acting like a helpless victim wallowing in his own self-pity while vying for sympathy essentially the opposite of how he was while attacking Tori Stafford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

> Not to be an expert in body language all you've done is laid her on in the field position since you've been here that's not how innocent people aren't that's not how people that are falsely accused of something is the lies that anything possibly that it's free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.

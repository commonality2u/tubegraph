Behavior-provoking questions are an [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation technique]] used to elicit specific behavioral responses from a suspect, which can then be analyzed for signs of deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This technique is often used in criminal investigations as part of broader [[interrogation_strategies_and_techniques | interrogation strategies and techniques]] and [[interrogation_analysis_techniques | interrogation analysis techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Types of Responses

The responses to behavior-provoking questions are typically categorized into two main types:

*   **Draconian Response** An innocent person will usually provide a draconian response, immediately suggesting the harshest possible sentence for the crime they are being falsely accused of committing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For example, when asked "What do you think we should do?" to the person who took the children, an innocent individual might immediately respond with "life in prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

*   **Equivocating Response** A deceptive individual will often give an equivocating response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This involves fragmenting and diverting from the question to avoid responding to the query in its entirety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. They might avoid direct answers or shift focus, such as responding to "What do you think we should do?" with "They're going to come home safe, correct?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Application in Interrogations

[[Interrogation techniques and suspect behavior | Interrogation techniques and suspect behavior]] often involve using these questions to gain insights.
For instance, in a specific case, an interrogator asked a suspect what should be done to the person who took his children. The suspect initially gave an equivocating response by asking about the children's safety instead of answering directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. When pressed further about what should happen if the perpetrator hurt them, he hesitated and questioned the applicability of the death penalty in Colorado, indicating a possible concern about the legal consequences of his own actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Another form of [[psychological_pressure_techniques | psychological pressure techniques]] disguised as routine questioning can also be considered a behavior-provoking question. An interrogator might ask a suspect to describe ways one could make someone disappear, specifically through murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This approach aims to understand the suspect's knowledge or thought processes regarding such acts, even if presented as a hypothetical scenario for establishing a baseline for a polygraph test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. The suspect's detailed or hesitant answers to such questions can provide further behavioral insights to the interrogator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

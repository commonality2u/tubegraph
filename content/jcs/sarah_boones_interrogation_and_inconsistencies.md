Sarah Boone, 42, faced interrogation regarding the death of her boyfriend, 42-year-old George Torres Jr. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. George died of suffocation after being locked inside a suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Boone claimed the incident was an unintentional accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. The interrogation revealed several inconsistencies in her account, particularly after police discovered critical video evidence.

## Initial Report and Explanation

On her 911 call, Sarah Boone stated that she and her boyfriend were "playing last night" and she "put him in a case" as a kind of hide-and-seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. She claimed she fell asleep and woke up to find him dead in the suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Boone also claimed she had tried to administer CPR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

During her initial interaction with officers, she reiterated her story of playing hide-and-seek and drinking a bottle of wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. She stated George got in the suitcase and she "zipped him up" as a joke, but then fell asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. She claimed they were both laughing about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## The Damning Video Evidence

Unbeknownst to Boone at the time of her initial statements, she had recorded two videos on her phone the night before George's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

The first video, taken at 11:12 PM, shows Boone laughing at George while he is zipped inside the suitcase. George is heard asking to be let out and repeatedly stating that he cannot breathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. The second video, recorded 11 minutes later, shows the same situation, but the suitcase has been flipped over and moved to a different area of the apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Sarah was noticeably and heavily intoxicated in both videos, which may explain why they were not deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

## Interrogation and Inconsistencies

During the formal interrogation, detectives presented the video evidence to Sarah Boone. Her reaction and subsequent explanations were rife with inconsistencies. This aspect of the case highlights significant elements of [[interrogation techniques and analysis]].

### Denial and Selective Memory
When first asked about any videos or photos taken on her phone on Sunday, Boone claimed to have only taken a picture of a dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. Upon being shown the video, she initially stated, "I don't remember that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>. She also said, "I don't want to see it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>.

However, after being confronted with the contents, including George's pleas of "I can't breathe" and her own derogatory comments, her memory became "selective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>. She then began to offer explanations for her actions, despite claiming no recollection moments before. This behavior can be indicative of [[innocent versus guilty behavior during interrogations]].

### Explaining George's Injuries
Forensics later confirmed that George sustained injuries, including to his left shoulder, a cut near his lip, a contusion on his neck, and bruising on his forehead, all on the night he died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. Boone denied causing these, suggesting he fell off her son's bike or ran into a wall/hall tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. She vehemently stated, "I have not touched him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. However, the nature and timing of the injuries contradicted her account of a peaceful evening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

### Domestic Violence History and Motivation
The interrogator brought up Boone's previous call to police reporting domestic violence involving George <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Sarah detailed how George "comes at me all the time" and that she usually tries to flee or go upstairs to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. This information provided a potential motive for retaliation, which is explored using [[behavior provoking questions in interrogations]].

She transitioned to claiming she doesn't normally drink and only does so because of George <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. She also spoke about George's anger management classes and his supposed progress, even claiming he would apologize to her after watching videos in class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. However, when the detective suggested that at some point, someone "gets enough" and has to "do something to defend themselves," Sarah's demeanor changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>.

### Discrepancies in Timeline and Actions
Boone recalled the "game" starting around 4 PM and her going to sleep around midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>. She explicitly stated that she had *never* zipped him in a suitcase prior to this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>.

When confronted with the videos, she tried to explain the suitcase being flipped by saying she "flipped it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>. She denied any malicious intent or that her plan was to leave him in there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. Despite George's pleas for release in the video, she claimed she thought he was okay and wasn't "panicky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>. She blamed her actions on the wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:00">[28:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>.

She maintained that she "didn't intentionally mean for this to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>, and that she "didn't know what to do" regarding calling 911 sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:00">[29:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>. This forms a core part of the [[sarah_boones_intoxication_and_video_evidence]].

## Arrest and Legal Proceedings

The interrogation culminated in Sarah Boone's arrest. When asked if she realized she was the person who killed George, she acknowledged thinking about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. Despite her continued denials of intent, she was arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>.

Boone was taken to the Orange County Jail at 5:44 PM and charged with second-degree murder, held without bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:00">[36:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:07:00">[36:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:09:00">[36:09:00]</a>. Her case has involved significant legal complexities, as she has worked with seven different attorneys, with six filing motions to withdraw due to "irreconcilable differences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:26:00">[36:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>.

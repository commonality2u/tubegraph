The interrogation of Leroy Daugherty, the prime suspect in the disappearance of Savannah Gold, culminated in a confession that was immediately followed by a profound [[emotional_responses_in_criminal_investigations | emotional reckoning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

## The Interrogation and Admission

During the interrogation, detectives employed specific [[interrogation_strategies_and_suspect_confession | interrogation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a> to gain Daugherty's confession. Initially, Daugherty had stated he hadn't seen Savannah in three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. However, once confronted with undisclosed surveillance footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, he began to amend his alibi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, admitting he saw her on Wednesday afternoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. He initially claimed Savannah got out of his car and into another vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

The detectives, knowing this was fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, continued to press Daugherty, ultimately revealing that the surveillance footage showed Savannah never exiting his car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. They maintained pressure, appealing to his sense of morality and emphasizing the family's need for closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. The detectives used techniques like the "how and why solution" and "alternative question" to lower his gauge of admission, suggesting an overdose as a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.

### The Confession Details

While the released footage of the interrogation tape cuts off at the moment of confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>, it is confirmed that Leroy Daugherty admitted to killing Savannah Gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. He proclaimed that he killed Savannah by breaking her neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. Subsequently, he stated he took her body back to his house, burned it in a self-made fire pit, and then dumped her remains in a lake at the dead end of a secluded road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

## Emotional Aftermath

Moments after his confession, the released footage shows Daugherty experiencing an overwhelming [[emotional_responses_in_criminal_investigations | emotional reckoning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. He was observed "trying to process the terrifying nature of his immediate situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. The narrator describes the scene:
> "The instant anguish over his decision to confess combined with the looming prospect of what lays ahead will have forged a unique emotional distress that very few will ever experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

His visible distress included him muttering "Oh stupid, stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

## Post-Confession Legal Strategy

Despite the overwhelming evidence against him and the prospect of life in prison without parole, Daugherty pled not guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. He claimed that Savannah's killing was an act of self-defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. His defense, considered a [[psychological_defense_strategies_in_court_cases | psychological defense strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>, asserted that he was in fear for his life after Savannah allegedly slapped him multiple times in the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>. He claimed that at that point, he grabbed her neck, felt a "pop," and realized he had accidentally broken it, resulting in her death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. This claim contrasts with his physical stature (5 foot 11, 163 pounds) compared to Savannah's (5 feet tall, 91 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. The medical examiner was unable to pinpoint the exact cause of death due to injuries to over 75 percent of her body, concluding it was a violent homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

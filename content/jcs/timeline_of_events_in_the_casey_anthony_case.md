This article outlines the significant events related to the disappearance and death of Caylee Anthony, and the subsequent trial of her mother, Casey Anthony.

## Background

Caylee Marie Anthony was born on August 9, 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Her death is considered the most heartbreaking part of the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The primary focus of the case later shifted to the [[psychological_analysis_of_casey_anthony | psychological constitution]] of her mother, Casey Marie Anthony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Caylee sadly passed away at some point between 1 pm and 8 pm on June 16, 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, discussions often centered on Casey's response to her daughter's death rather than the circumstances of the death itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Two clinical psychologists evaluated Casey during her time in custody and found no abnormalities in her [[psychological_analysis_of_casey_anthony | psychological state]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, meaning there were no signs of mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Disappearance and Initial Investigation

*   **June 7, 2008**: Caylee was last seen by her grandparents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Casey claimed to have dropped Caylee off at a babysitter's apartment on June 9, 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **June 16, 2008**: This day is believed to be when Caylee was murdered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.
    *   Casey Anthony conducted internet searches for "How to make chloroform" at 1:15 pm and "neck breaking" at 1:44 pm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
    *   At 7:54 pm, Casey and her boyfriend, Tony, were seen at a Blockbuster video store, with Caylee nowhere in sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Many presumed Caylee was already deceased and in Casey's car trunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.
*   **Following Weeks**: Casey went out partying most nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.
    *   **Three days after supposed abduction**: Casey participated in a "hot body" contest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>.
    *   **Twelve days after supposed abduction**: Casey got a tattoo on her back that read "Bella Vita," an Italian phrase meaning "beautiful life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>. Around this time, she also wrote in her diary, expressing happiness and trust in her own judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.
*   **July 15, 2008**: Cindy Anthony, Caylee's grandmother, called 911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. She reported that Caylee had been missing for a month and that Casey had finally admitted the baby was "in the store" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Cindy also reported that Casey's car smelled like a "dead body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This call was made after George Anthony found the family car at an impound lot, emitting a strong odor he recognized as human decomposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Casey's parents tracked her down at her boyfriend's house, where she claimed Caylee had been kidnapped by a babysitter named "Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez" 31 days prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **July 16, 2008**: Casey Anthony was interviewed by Detective Melissa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. During this interview, Casey provided numerous fabrications, including details about a fictitious babysitter ("Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez") and a non-existent co-worker ("Juliette Lewis") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. She also claimed to work as an event coordinator at Universal Studios, where she had not been employed for over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Casey later admitted she purposely misled detectives by taking them to fake addresses and a non-existent office at Universal Studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. She was arrested after admitting she didn't work there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Nine days after arrest**: Casey received her first visit from her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   **August 21, 2008**: [[jodi_ariass_defense_and_trial_proceedings | Jose Baez]], Casey's attorney, secured her release on bail, and she was fitted with an electronic monitoring device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. She had spent just over one month in custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Discovery of Remains and Murder Charges

*   **December 11, 2008**: Caylee's skeletal remains were discovered in a swamp less than a mile from the Anthony household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. She was found wrapped in a Winnie-the-Pooh blanket inside a canvas laundry bag, with duct tape around the nose and mouth area of the skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. Her death was ruled a homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   **Two months after bail release**: Police arrested Casey on the charge of first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. She remained in county jail for two and a half years awaiting trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

## The Trial

*   **May 24, 2011**: The trial commenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.
    *   The prosecution argued that Casey suffocated Caylee with duct tape, placed her in a trunk, and later disposed of her body in a swamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. They focused on the motive, asserting that Caylee's death allowed Casey to live a "good life" for 31 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.
    *   The defense, led by [[jodi_ariass_defense_and_trial_proceedings | Jose Baez]], asserted that Caylee Anthony drowned accidentally in the family's swimming pool on June 16, 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. They claimed Casey had been sexually abused by her father, George Anthony, since she was eight years old, and that this led her to lie and hide her pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>. The defense's strategy was to create doubt and evoke empathy from the jury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

*   **July 3, 2011**: Closing arguments were presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.
*   **July 5, 2011**: The jury rendered its verdict. Casey Anthony was found **not guilty** of first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>, aggravated child abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>, and aggravated manslaughter of a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>.

Casey's attorney, [[jodi_ariass_defense_and_trial_proceedings | Jose Baez]], stated after the verdict that Casey did not murder Caylee, and that the justice system had not dishonored Caylee's memory by a false conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>.

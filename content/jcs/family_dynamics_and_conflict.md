## Grant Amato's Background and Dependence
In mid-2018, 29-year-old Grant was unemployed and lived rent-free in his parents' guest house in Chuliota, Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He had never lived independently and had recently been expelled from anesthesiology school for poor attendance and fired from a nursing job for stealing medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Financial Ruin and Family Intervention
Around this time, Grant began spending money on online cam models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Using his brother's credit card, he spent an average of 20 minutes on each model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Beginning on June 5th, he became obsessed with a performer named Sylvie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Over six months, Grant spent over $200,000 of his family's money on Sylvie, depleting his father's life savings from over 30 years as a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This included $60,000 from his brother's credit card and a $65,000 loan taken out on the family home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Grant later admitted to lying to his family, claiming the money was for his Twitch streaming advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

Instead of contacting the police, Grant's family sent him to a behavioral rehabilitation facility for online porn addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Grant stated that he did not agree to go, but his father insisted, with his mother and brother also agreeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The clinic diagnosed it as an isolated event and found he didn't need medication, attributing his issues to being out of work and having PTSD from an earlier arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Grant's brother Cody paid the $15,000 cost of the rehabilitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

## Post-Rehab Rules and Renewed Conflict
Upon Grant's return from rehab on January 4th, his father presented him with a two-page list of rules, including ceasing all communication with Sylvie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. However, within three weeks, the family discovered Grant had re-established contact with Sylvie via Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. His mother had reportedly allowed him to use her cell phone for this communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Grant felt an [[virtual_relationships_and_financial_consequences | emotional connection]] and relationship with Sylvie and didn't want to stop "cold turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

On January 24th, Grant's father, Chad Amato, confronted him, leading to a heated argument that almost became a [[details_of_the_altercation | physical altercation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Grant was then kicked out of the house, living on his own for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. He later claimed his father had pulled him from the couch and yelled at him to pack his belongings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

## Grant's Perspective on Family Relationships
During his interrogation, Grant described his relationships with his family members:

### Relationship with Cody Amato (Brother)
Grant and Cody were very close, having decided to go to nursing school and nurse anesthesia school together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Grant stated, "a lot of people thought that it was weird because we did everything together and because we were so close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. He emphasized Cody's constant support: "he was can take care of everything, it's always there for you, always there to support you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. While their relationship had been trying during the last six months due to the financial issues, Cody's anger never turned violent towards Grant, though he once dented a wall by pushing a cabinet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Grant felt Cody would always be there for him "whatever it takes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Relationship with Margaret Amato (Mother)
Grant described his mother as someone who "always been the one that focused on me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. He stated they "yelled at each other a grand total of like three or four times my whole life" and "never any issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. He always felt he could talk to his mom if Cody wasn't available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. His father would tell him, "you're her favorite, I mean she would do anything for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

### Relationship with Chad Amato (Father)
Grant characterized his father as "a very like angry violent type person" and "overbearing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. He recounted instances from childhood, like five-hour baseball practices where his father would hurl balls at him while he was in seventh or eighth grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. His father would "belittle me when I was younger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The last time his father allegedly put his hands on him was in mid-December 2018, prior to Grant's rehab stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This was due to the money being spent and his father perceiving Grant as unconcerned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Grant felt his father's constant criticism and focus on money was "overbearing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. His father also reportedly threatened to kill him if he continued to cause financial problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

## The Murders
The morning after Grant was kicked out, Cody's girlfriend called police when he failed to show up for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Police found Chad, Margaret, and Cody dead from gunshot wounds to the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Grant became the prime suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Forensics later proved that Grant shot his mother Margaret in the back of the head while she was at the computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. He then waited for his father Chad, shooting him twice in the head upon his entry to the kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. Cody received a text from his father's phone asking him to come home urgently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>, and was found in the fetal position with a gunshot wound to the face after entering the front door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. Grant then stole Cody's credit card and used it to purchase $600 worth of cam model services about 30 minutes later from a Publix parking lot using their Wi-Fi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

During his interrogation, Grant maintained his innocence and attempted to frame Cody, suggesting Cody would "take care of it" and that a shooting occurred between Cody and his dad to protect him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

Grant's trial began on August 12, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. The prosecution argued the case was about Grant's "blind obsession with this woman" and his "absolute contempt for those that he held responsible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.

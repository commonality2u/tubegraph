In mid-2018, 29-year-old Grant Amato was unemployed and living rent-free in his parents' guest house in Chuliota, Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He had never lived on his own, having been kicked out of anesthesiology school for lack of attendance and fired from a nursing job for stealing medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This period marked a significant shift in his life when he began experimenting with online cam sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Financial Strain and Addiction
Grant quickly became obsessed with a cam model known as Sylvie, spending over $200,000 of his family's money on her over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This amount constituted his father's entire life savings, accumulated from over 30 years as a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. He also spent $60,000 from his brother's credit card and took out a $65,000 loan on the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

When his family discovered the extent of his spending, they did not call the police but instead sent Grant to a behavioral rehabilitation facility for online porn addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The facility, Cornerstone in Fort Lauderdale, cost $15,000, paid for by his brother Cody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. Grant claimed the therapists there diagnosed his situation as an isolated event, attributing it to being out of work and experiencing PTSD from a previous arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

## Family Relationships and Mounting Conflict
Upon returning from rehab on January 4th, Grant's father presented him with a two-page list of rules for continued residency, including an immediate cessation of all communication with Sylvie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. However, within three weeks, the family discovered he had broken this contract, re-establishing contact via Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Relationship with Cody Amato (Brother)
Grant described Cody as his closest family member, stating they did "everything together," including going to nursing school and planning to attend nurse anesthesia school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. He characterized Cody as always being there for him, supportive regardless of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Despite their closeness, Grant noted that the last six months had been "trying," with Cody having moments of extreme upset, even denting a wall by pushing a cabinet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Relationship with Margaret Amato (Mother)
Grant depicted his mother as a constant source of focus and support, similar to Cody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. He recalled yelling at her only "three or four times" in his entire life and consistently turned to her for conversation when Cody was unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. She even secretly allowed him to continue talking to Sylvie via her cell phone and Twitter after his father's rules were established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

### Relationship with Chad Amato (Father)
In stark contrast, Grant described his father as a "very angry, violent type person" and overbearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. He recalled his father belittling him as a child and attempting to motivate him by instilling guilt about not getting a job, often stating that Grant was his mother's favorite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Chad was the "Iron Fist" who insisted Grant attend rehab, primarily due to financial concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. After rehab, Grant felt his father was "overbearing," constantly discussing his financial troubles for "hours a day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Grant also alleged his father had threatened to kill him if he continued to cause financial problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

## The Climax of Conflict
On January 24th, Chad Amato confronted Grant about his continued communication with Sylvie, leading to a heated argument that nearly became physical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Grant was subsequently kicked out of the house, leaving him on his own for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. He left around 9 or 9:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

The next morning, January 25th, police were called when Cody Amato failed to show up for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. They found Chad, Margaret, and Cody Amato dead inside the residence, all with gunshot wounds to the head from a nine-millimeter handgun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Grant immediately became the prime suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

During his interrogation, Grant attempted to frame his brother Cody for a double murder-suicide, claiming Cody would "take care of it" after their mother informed him of Grant being kicked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. However, forensic evidence revealed a different timeline:
*   Grant shot Margaret Amato in the back of the head while she was at the computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   He then waited for Chad to return home and shot him twice in the head as he entered the kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.
*   Grant then used his father's phone to text Cody, asking him to come home urgently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
*   Cody was found with a gunshot wound to the face, lying in the fetal position, soon after entering the front door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   Grant then used Cody's credit card to make a $600 purchase on a cam site approximately 30 minutes later, from a Publix supermarket parking lot where he used free Wi-Fi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

Grant was arrested nine hours after his interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. His trial began on August 12, 2019, focusing on his "blind obsession" with Sylvie and his "absolute contempt" for those he held responsible for the perceived "end of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. Grant Amato was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.

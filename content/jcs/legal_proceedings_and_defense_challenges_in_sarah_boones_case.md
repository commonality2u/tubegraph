Sarah Boone's legal journey began following the death of her boyfriend, George Torres Jr., who was found deceased in a suitcase. Her initial claims of an accident were quickly challenged by crucial evidence discovered during the investigation.

## Initial Investigation and Evidence Discovery

On the day George Torres Jr. was found dead, [[sarah_boones_911_call_and_explanation_of_events | Sarah Boone called 911]] stating her boyfriend was dead, explaining they were "playing last night" and she put him in a suitcase during a "hide and seek kind of thing" before she fell asleep [00:00:28]. She claimed she woke up to find him dead, unaware of what happened [00:00:35]. She also stated she had attempted CPR [00:00:55].

However, investigators uncovered critical [[videos_recorded_by_sarah_boone_and_their_implications | videos recorded by Sarah Boone]] on her phone from the night before [00:02:08].
*   The first video, taken at 11:12 PM, shows Sarah laughing at George while he is zipped inside the suitcase. In this video, George is heard repeatedly asking to be let out and stating he "can't breathe" [00:02:12].
*   A second video, recorded 11 minutes later, shows the same situation, but the suitcase had been flipped over and moved to a different area of the apartment [00:02:21]. Sarah appeared "unmistakably and heavily intoxicated" in these videos [00:02:30].

## Interrogation and Arrest

[[sarah_boones_arrest_and_questioning_by_police | Sarah Boone's arrest and questioning by police]] began when she was first interviewed at her apartment. She reiterated her story about playing hide and seek, drinking wine, and falling asleep [00:03:27]. Her ex-husband, who was present, informed police that George Torres Jr. had been arrested multiple times for domestic violence against Sarah, and she had consistently bailed him out [00:05:01].

The following day, Sarah voluntarily attended the Sheriff's Office at 3:51 PM, bringing a handwritten list of questions [00:08:12]. During this interrogation, investigators informed her about the autopsy findings, which revealed injuries to George's left shoulder, a cut near his lip, and bruising on his forehead and skull [00:09:03]. Forensics later confirmed these injuries occurred the night he died and were not present before he entered the apartment [00:09:21]. Sarah denied any knowledge of how George sustained these injuries, asserting they "had a good time" [00:09:54].

The detectives then revealed the videos found on her phone. Sarah initially claimed she didn't remember recording them [00:18:12]. As the videos were played, showing George struggling and stating he couldn't breathe, Sarah became distressed, denying her actions were intentional [00:19:34]. She admitted to flipping the suitcase over [00:20:08] but insisted she did not intend to leave him in there [00:21:24]. Despite George's pleas in the video, Sarah is heard laughing and saying "f*** you" [00:21:19], which she dismissed as their normal interaction [00:22:07].

Towards the end of the interrogation, detectives directly confronted Sarah: "You realize you're the person that killed him, right?" [00:30:04]. Sarah denied this, stating it was "not intentionally" [00:30:06]. The interrogation culminated in her arrest.

## Legal Proceedings and Defense Challenges

Sarah Boone was taken to the Orange County Jail at 5:44 PM on February 2020 [00:36:05]. She was charged with second-degree murder and held without bond [00:36:10].

Her case has faced significant defense challenges since her arrest. She has been working with her seventh attorney [00:36:26]. Six of her previous attorneys have filed motions to withdraw from her case [00:36:28], all citing "irreconcilable differences" as the reason [00:36:32]. As of the transcript's date, a trial date was set for April 10th of the current year [00:36:24].

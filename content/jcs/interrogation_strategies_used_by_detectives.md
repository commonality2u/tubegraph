Detectives employ various [[interrogation techniques and strategies used by detectives | interrogation techniques]] and tactics during investigations to elicit information and confessions from suspects. These methods often involve psychological manipulation, careful evidence management, and strategic questioning.

## Initial Investigative Approach

Detectives meticulously plan their steps to avoid compromising the investigation. A key strategy is to initially withhold crucial evidence from a suspect, as knowing this information could allow them to alter their alibi to fit the evidence, thereby hindering the investigators' ability to build a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Psychological Preparation of the Suspect

Before the formal [[interrogation techniques | interrogation]] begins, detectives may use tactics to mentally prepare the suspect. For example, a suspect might be left alone for an extended period, allowing anxiety to fester and intensify, especially if they are already aware of a related prior interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:22">[05:20:22]</a>. The sudden appearance of an investigator previously involved in the case can immediately convert any brief relief into shock, making the suspect realize the severity of their situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

## Questioning and Deception Strategies

### Open-Ended Questions
Detectives often begin an [[interrogation techniques | interrogation]] with open-ended questions, granting the suspect total freedom in their response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. The psychological premise behind this is that:
*   Truthful subjects tend to give short, concise answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.
*   Individuals with something to hide are more likely to give lengthy and detailed responses, seeking approval and attempting to appease the perceived threat of the interrogator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

### Feigning Belief and Lowering Guard
Detectives might pretend to believe a suspect's fabricated alibi, continuously inquiring into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>. This is not for information gathering but to allow the suspect to let their guard down, diminish their anxiety, and increase their belief in their ability to fool the detectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

### Confrontation and Disorientation
A key strategy involves initiating the first confrontation when the suspect is completely off-guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. A sharp and sudden switch from a relaxed state to feeling threatened can disorient a suspect, impairing their ability to think critically or fabricate emotion convincingly on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>.

### Direct Accusation and Observing Response
More aggressive confrontations involve directly accusing the suspect of involvement in the disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>. Innocent subjects typically reciprocate aggression and refute allegations forcefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:07:00">[23:07:00]</a>. A suspect who shows no emotional response or shock, but rather a composed demeanor, suggests they anticipated a blunt confrontation, indicating guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>.

### Maximizing Pressure with Evidence
When a suspect remains unyielding, detectives reveal their most substantial piece of evidence to maximize pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>.

### Techniques to Lower Admission Threshold
*   **How and Why Solution**: This technique attempts to blame the victim while minimizing the motivations behind the crime, making it easier for a suspect to admit to a lesser degree of involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>.
*   **Alternative Question**: This plants a seed in the suspect's mind by offering a more morally acceptable alternative for what might have happened, encouraging a confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:59:00">[27:59:00]</a>.

### Relentless Pressure and Appeal to Morality
Detectives maintain relentless pressure for a confession by attacking the suspect's character while simultaneously appealing to their sense of morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>. This includes emphasizing the victim's humanity and the family's right to closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a>. The goal is to get "one foot in the door" with any level of admission, which then serves as a new foundation for building the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46:00">[31:46:00]</a>.

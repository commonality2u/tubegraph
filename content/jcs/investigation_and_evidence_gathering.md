The [[investigation_process_and_surveillance_evidence | investigation process]] into the disappearance and murder of eight-year-old Tori Stafford in 2009 involved a rapid deployment of resources, public appeals, and the strategic use of [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | interrogation techniques]] and [[role_of_evidence_in_criminal_investigations | evidence]].

## Initial Missing Persons Investigation
Tori Stafford was last seen leaving Oliver Stevens School in Woodstock, Ontario, at 3:27 p.m. on April 8, 2009, after returning inside to retrieve her mother's earrings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. She was reported missing by her grandmother at 6:04 p.m. the same day, prompting an immediate missing-persons [[investigation_process_and_surveillance_evidence | investigation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Key Early Evidence
*   **Surveillance Footage**: Approximately seven hours after Tori was reported missing, [[investigation_process_and_surveillance_evidence | surveillance footage]] from a local high school captured her walking alongside an unidentified woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Tori did not appear to be struggling in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The woman was described as 19-25 years old, white, 5'2", 125 pounds, with a black ponytail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Public Appeals**: Local police made a public appeal for the woman in the video to come forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Tori's grandparents offered a $10,000 reward for her return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, and a Facebook group dedicated to finding her gained over 20,000 followers within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Polygraph Tests**: Over the following week, Tori's parents were interviewed by [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | investigators]] and each passed a polygraph test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Escalation of the Investigation
Six days after Tori's disappearance, initial ground searches were called off due to a lack of clues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. However, the case gained national attention when *America's Most Wanted* featured it as its top story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

On April 17, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) took the lead in the [[investigation_process_and_surveillance_evidence | investigation]], and ground searches resumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The case was officially reclassified as an abduction, not just a missing person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. A media campaign was stepped up with the release of a composite sketch of the woman from the video, circulated on social media and news outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Breakthrough: Terry Lynn McClintock
On May 19, police received information identifying the woman in the video as 18-year-old Terry Lynn McClintock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. McClintock was already in custody for breaching a probation order related to a previous drug violation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### McClintock's Interrogation and Confession
McClintock was transferred to the Ontario Police Headquarters and interviewed by Detective Sergeant Jim Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Initially, she denied involvement and claimed to know nothing about Tori <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. However, approximately 45 minutes into the [[interrogation_techniques_used_in_criminal_investigation | interrogation]], she confessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

McClintock described the abduction and killing of Tori Stafford in disturbing detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>:
*   She lured Tori into a secluded parking space with the promise of showing her a puppy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Tori was then forced into the backseat of a vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   The driver was 28-year-old Michael Rafferty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Rafferty drove to a secluded area about 100 miles north of Woodstock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   He sexually assaulted and murdered the eight-year-old, with the fatal injuries being four strikes to the head with a claw hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

McClintock drew a rough sketch of the area where Tori was killed, which led police to discover Tori's remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Tori was found with lacerations to her liver and 16 broken ribs, and the cause of death correlated with McClintock's testimony: repeated blows to the head with a blunt object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Michael Rafferty's Arrest and Interrogation
At 7:55 p.m. on the same evening, Michael Rafferty was arrested and charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. He was read his rights and brought to police headquarters for immediate [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | interrogation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### [[interrogation_techniques_used_in_criminal_investigation | Interrogation Techniques Used]]
Staff Sergeant Chris Loam, head of the OPP's Behavioral Sciences unit (which includes criminal profiling, threat assessment, and [[forensic_investigation_techniques | forensic psychiatry]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, conducted Rafferty's [[interrogation_techniques_in_criminal_investigations | interrogation]].

*   **Rapport Development**: Loam adopted a friendly and "nonchalant disposition" to make Rafferty more likely to cooperate and downplay the severity of the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. He offered food and drink, despite not intending to provide them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>.
*   **Threat Assessment Deception**: Loam claimed his primary purpose was to assess Rafferty's "threat level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, implying a less severe outcome for cooperation. This was a deceptive tactic, as the severity of the crime already determined the threat level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Psychological Pressure & Mental Exhaustion**: Loam used a "rambling" strategy to keep Rafferty's mind racing, preventing him from conjuring lies or disassociating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. He also repeatedly asserted Rafferty's involvement based on [[role_of_evidence_in_criminal_investigations | evidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> and McClintock's testimony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, aiming to strip away Rafferty's "psychological endurance and constancy for self-preservation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **"Good Cop, Bad Cop" (Mutt and Jeff Technique)**: After 95 minutes, another [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | investigator]] (Blake) joined the [[interrogation_techniques_used_in_criminal_investigation | interrogation]], adopting an aggressive stance, openly hostile and accusatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>. This created a "fear then relief" response, aiming to disorient Rafferty and make him more compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. Blake graphically detailed McClintock's confession and emphasized the [[role_of_evidence_in_criminal_investigations | forensic evidence]] against Rafferty, such as Tori's blood and DNA in his car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.

Despite these [[interrogation_techniques_in_criminal_investigations | techniques]], Rafferty remained unyielding and largely silent, continuing to deny his full involvement. However, the [[impact_of_evidence_and_videos_in_criminal_cases | impact of evidence and videos]] and McClintock's confession provided sufficient basis for charges.

## [[the_investigation_and_trial_outcomes | Investigation and Trial Outcomes]]
The [[investigation_process_and_surveillance_evidence | investigation]] gathered significant [[role_of_evidence_in_criminal_investigations | evidence]], including [[investigation_process_and_surveillance_evidence | surveillance video]], Terry Lynn McClintock's detailed confession, and [[forensic_investigation_techniques | forensic evidence]] (such as Tori's remains and implied DNA in Rafferty's car) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Michael Rafferty was found guilty of murdering, kidnapping, and sexually assaulting eight-year-old Tori Stafford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. Both Michael Rafferty and Terry Lynn McClintock were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. The [[the_investigation_and_trial_outcomes | trial outcomes]] brought a sense of justice for Tori's family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.

The interrogation of Stephanie Lazarus, a police detective, revolved around the 1986 murder of Sherry Rasmussen, the wife of John Ruetten, with whom Lazarus had a previous relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. The detectives used a ruse involving stolen art to bring her in, preparing extensively for the interview due to her law enforcement background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Interrogation and Initial Reactions

Detectives began by setting a compatible tone, negating the negative implications of an interrogation room by presenting the meeting as a consultative one about art theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. The true reason for the unusual location was to ensure Lazarus surrendered her firearm without suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

Lazarus initially feigned vague memory regarding John Ruetten, pausing for a prolonged period when his name was first mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. She minimized her relationship with him, stating they met in dorms but omitting their four-year dating history and numerous holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. When confronted about John's wife, Sherry, Lazarus's body language suggested she was struck by a psychological "fight or flight" reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. She used exclamatory remarks like "gosh" and "gee" to insinuate a vague memory, attempting to convey that she had no reason to dwell on John or anything related to him after two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

As the interrogation progressed, Lazarus became increasingly agitated, perceiving the shift from an art case to a murder investigation as an accusation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>. When asked for a DNA swab, she indicated she would need to speak to a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. She expressed shock at being considered a suspect, stating, "I can't even believe it... I'm shocked... that somebody would be saying that I did this. I mean we had a fight so I went and killed her? I mean come on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>. Ultimately, when read her Miranda rights, she chose to remain silent and declined to speak further without an attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>.

## Trial Outcome and Sentencing

The jury in *People of the State of California versus Stephanie Eileen Lazarus* found the defendant guilty of the crime of murder of Sherry Rasmussen, specifying it as first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>. Stephanie Lazarus was sentenced to 27 years to life for the murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>. She is currently held in the maximum security unit of the Central California Women's Facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.

The [[legal_outcome_and_plea_deals | legal outcome]] of the [[interrogation_and_trial_of_jodi_arias | trial]] had a profound [[impact_on_victims_and_families | impact on the families involved]]. During the sentencing hearing, John Ruetten, Sherry Rasmussen's husband, spoke about the immense loss:

> "There are really no words that can describe the loss of Sherry and the whole of this experience. So it makes no sense to talk very long. It suffices to say that the Rasmussen family, my family, and Stephanie's family have been thrust into a bizarre world of disbelief and indescribable sadness." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>

He emphasized Sherry Rasmussen's profound [[impact_on_victims_and_families | impact on many people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>. John described Sherry as a "startling" physical presence who was "extraordinary more for who she was than the way she looked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a>. He characterized her as:

> "a hard worker, a consummate professional, a leader, a diplomat, forgiving, tough and a kid at heart." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>

The loss of Sherry, the manner of her death, and the [[trial_and_sentencing_of_michael_rafferty_and_terry_lynn_mcclintock | trial]] 25 years later had a significant [[impact_on_victims_and_families | impact on many others]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>. The effects were broad, spanning a generation and causing pain for those whose lives should have never been touched by the tragic event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>. John Ruetten expressed his personal anguish, stating:

> "the fact that Sherry's death occurred because she met and married me brings me to my knees." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:39:00">[24:39:00]</a>

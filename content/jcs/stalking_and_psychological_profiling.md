When forensic health professionals evaluate stalking, they consider four essential items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>:
1.  The nature of the relationship between the stalker and the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
2.  The stalker's motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
3.  The psychological, psychopathological, and social realities of the stalker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
4.  The psychological and social vulnerabilities of the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

The evolution of technology over the past two decades, particularly the internet and its search history, has made forensic investigations considerably more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Web browser data can be a crucial piece of evidence, unveiling aspects of a suspect's personality that would otherwise remain hidden, often proving more effective than information from a full confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Case Study: Stephen McDaniel

This episode focuses on 25-year-old Stephen McDaniel to illustrate these components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### The Stalker's Profile: Stephen McDaniel

Stephen McDaniel's internet history revealed extensive viewing of violent and torture-themed pornography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He also conducted repeated searches on "how to commit sexual assault" and variations of "how to molest sleeping girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Forensics interprets this as an overt sign of desensitization to sexual activity, where excessive exposure to online pornography can build tolerance to traditional sex, leading individuals to seek more potent stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For McDaniel, this progression from abstract online material eventually led to planning and carrying out what he saw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### The Victim's Profile: Lauren Giddings

Lauren Giddings, 24, was Stephen's next-door neighbor of three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Regarding social vulnerabilities, Lauren had none; she was outgoing, popular, a well-liked community member, and had a strong social support system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

However, in terms of psychological vulnerabilities, "perceptual naivety" came to light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Stephen had asked her out on a date within six months of their acquaintance, which was only the second time they had spoken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Lauren declined but stated she wished to remain friends out of courtesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. She later confided in friends that Stephen made her feel extremely uneasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

In hindsight, her instinctive senses were trying to alert her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Lauren had told friends multiple times she felt someone had been inside her apartment and experienced an eerie vibe when returning alone, especially late at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. She even considered moving but never followed through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The reality was that Stephen McDaniel had stolen a master key from a security guard, let himself into her apartment on several occasions, and filmed her movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Lauren lacked proof of the danger, only intuition, which was not strong enough when most needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### The Crime and Initial Investigation

Stephen McDaniel snuck into Lauren's apartment while she was sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. When she awoke and panicked, he strangled her for approximately 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Lauren fought back, clawing at his face and chest, but was eventually overpowered and died of asphyxiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. After the murder, Stephen dismembered her body in the bathtub with a hacksaw, cutting her into five pieces, placing each in a trash bag, and disposing of them in separate trash cans around campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Three days later, Lauren's friends, concerned, entered her apartment with a spare key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. McDaniel noticed from his window and invited himself in, offering to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. All of Lauren's belongings, including her cell phone, driver's license, and passport, were still inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. A missing person's report was filed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The next morning, a search party discovered Lauren's torso in a trash can near the apartment complex, switching the investigation to a murder inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The rest of her remains were never recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Stephen McDaniel's Interrogation

Police began interviewing neighbors and classmates, including Stephen McDaniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He was first interviewed by local news, unaware at the time that part of the victim's remains had been discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. When asked about the discovery of a body in the parking lot, he responded with a likely genuine reaction, disguised as sorrow, but actually a sense of fear and shock over the discovery of evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

He was interviewed by police at 11:50 a.m., offering to help but appearing fidgety and apprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. During this interview, he claimed to be a virgin saving himself for marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Detectives also found scratch marks on his face and stomach, which he attributed to scratching himself in his sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. He then unknowingly became the prime suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Upon searching his apartment (with his reluctant consent), investigators found swords, guns, stockpiled toilet rolls, provisions for an apocalyptic event, and a mask made from women's underwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The discovery of condoms contradicted his claim of celibacy; he "miraculously confessed" to stealing them from another apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This provided probable cause for arrest, and his [[interrogation_analysis | interrogation]] began after 11 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

#### Stephen's Demeanor and Interrogation Dynamics

Stephen's monotone dialogue and lifeless demeanor, which started on the drive to the station, were mystifying and "almost impressive" throughout the entire [[interrogation_analysis | interrogation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. He morphed into an "abnormal and extremely creepy character," dictating the pace of the [[interrogation_analysis | interrogation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

When a detective used recognized [[interrogation_techniques_and_strategies_used_by_detectives | techniques to increase psychological pressure]] by closing distance and commanding eye contact, Stephen's haunting gaze unnerved the detective, causing him to look away and reset his posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This unusual occurrence in [[interrogation_analysis | interrogations]] can boost a suspect's confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

Detectives initially adopted an aggressive approach, then shifted to trivial questions, attempting to ramp up pressure more subtly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. As Stephen's demeanor remained unwavering for the first 20 minutes, the detective tried a distinctly aggressive approach, attacking his character to try and coerce him into defending his dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. A second detective entered with a similar immediate aggression, abandoning rapport development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

Later, a detective completely shifted strategy from confrontational to sympathetic, trying to create a connection and offer a socially acceptable reason for the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. This is typically done *before* aggression, and Stephen immediately shut down the offered sympathy about unsupportive parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. The lead detective then spent almost 30 minutes asking non-confrontational questions, hoping to change Stephen's demeanor, but his lifeless disposition persisted for nearly 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

Confronted with the implication of DNA evidence (hair at the scene), Stephen, as a law student, would have been aware that his presence at Lauren's apartment with her friends after her death would nullify this as damning evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. The detectives also employed the "futility technique," trying to make him believe resistance was useless due to overwhelming evidence, but their bluff about blood in his apartment was called as the dismemberment occurred in Lauren's apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

The detective also tried inducing mental exhaustion by repeating "you hurt that girl" for 20 minutes, but it had no effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Eventually, the lead detective abandoned seeking admission and instead proceeded to belittle and humiliate Stephen, likely out of frustration and certainty of his culpability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. This behavior, while seemingly cruel in other contexts, creates an "ethical vacuum" where empathy is stripped away due to the impression of retribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

### Outcome

The entire [[interrogation_analysis | interrogation]] lasted over two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. Stephen's "catatonic performance" was remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. However, when his mother came to speak with him shortly after, he immediately snapped out of his zombie-like character while still maintaining his innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>. The reasoning behind this performance – whether pre-planned, improvised, or a [[interrogation_and_psychological_analysis | psychological breakdown]] – remains unclear, but it evidently worked, as the interrogators "got nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>. His abnormal behavior left them at a loss for a specific plan of attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

Despite the lack of confession during the [[interrogation_analysis | interrogation]], the evidence was irrefutable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>. Hundreds of pictures of Lauren and multiple video recordings from inside her apartment were found on Stephen's flash drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. A hacksaw, marked red with Lauren's blood (confirmed by DNA testing), was discovered in the apartment complex's supply closet, and its packaging was found in Stephen's apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

When confronted with this evidence, Stephen McDaniel took a plea deal to avoid the death penalty and was sentenced to life without parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. He is currently held at Hancock State Prison in Sparta, Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

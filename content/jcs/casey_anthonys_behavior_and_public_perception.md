The primary subject of interest in the [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | disappearance and death]] of two-year-old Kaylee Anthony is not the tragic events surrounding her passing, but rather the perplexing and disturbing psychological constitution of her mother, Casey Marie Anthony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Her conduct following Kaylee's death was unimaginably cold-blooded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Initial Observations and 911 Calls

On July 15, 2008, after Kaylee had been missing for over a month, Cindy Anthony, Casey's mother, called 911, reporting her granddaughter missing and stating that Casey's car smelled like a dead body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. When the dispatcher spoke to Casey, her voice lacked any urgency or concern, contrasting sharply with her distraught mother's demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Police immediately picked up on this indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Deceptive Conduct During Investigation

Casey Anthony's behavior during the initial investigation was characterized by extensive fabrications.
She claimed her daughter had been kidnapped by a nanny named "Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez" or "Zanny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. She also stated she worked as an event coordinator at Universal Studios and had a coworker named "Juliette Lewis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Both "Zaneda" and "Juliette" were proven not to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. In reality, Casey had not been employed at Universal for over two years and had worked at a kiosk selling photos, not as an event coordinator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

During an interview, detectives noted that everything Casey told them was a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. When asked why she didn't call the police sooner, she claimed she was naive and scared that notifying authorities or media would harm Kaylee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. She admitted to purposely misleading the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. This meticulous detailing in her lies is a textbook sign of a pathological liar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Her eloquent and natural speech, along with a nonchalant tone, served to camouflage anxiety and facilitate deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

> [!note] Psychological Evaluation
> During her time in custody, two clinical psychologists evaluated Casey, finding no signs of mental illness or psychological abnormalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This made her character study fascinating and terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Behavior in Custody and Family Visits

After her arrest, Casey made a phone call from jail, where she casually mentioned seeing her mother on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. She seemed to blame her mother for her incarceration, stating, "you're blaming me that you're sitting in the jail blame yourself for telling lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

During her first visit from her parents nine days into custody, Casey appeared composed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. She only showed vulnerability and expressed pain when her parents stopped inquiring about the [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | case]] and focused on her well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. Notably, she showed no emotion when seeing her deceased daughter's face on her father's shirt just moments before breaking down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. She dismissed her parents' questions about Kaylee's whereabouts as "pointless and irritating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.

> [!info] Public Reaction
> After footage of Casey's interrogations and jail visits was released, the public largely viewed her as a cold-hearted mother or a despicable murderer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.

## Public Perception and Media Influence

Casey's consistently bubbly and agreeable personality, even in inappropriate situations, made her seem "off" to many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. This fraudulent way of being was so ingrained that it appeared natural even in extraordinary circumstances like police interrogations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. This behavior, where she maintained a confident and talkative disposition in serious situations, was seen as an attempt to mask anxiety and conceal guilty behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. Such a mindset, focused on self-presentation rather than the quality of her character, is linked to sociopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.

Despite the dire circumstances, Casey was seen partying, participating in a "hot body contest," and getting a tattoo that read "bella vita" (beautiful life) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. Her diary entry from the same period expressed happiness and trust in her own judgment, reinforcing the perception of her indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.

## Defense Strategy and Perception During Trial

During the [[casey_anthony_trial_and_verdict | trial]], the prosecution highlighted Casey's deceptive nature, arguing her behavior showed she wanted to live a "free life" unburdened by a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. The defense, led by Jose Baez, countered by acknowledging her bizarre behavior but reframing it. They claimed Kaylee's death was an accidental drowning and Casey hid it due to a lifetime of hiding pain and secrets stemming from alleged sexual abuse by her father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>. This narrative argued that her lying was a learned coping mechanism rather than an indication of guilt for murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>.

The defense aimed to create doubt and evoke empathy, accusing the prosecution of using emotion rather than evidence to sway the jury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. They emphasized that if the jury hated Casey for her lies and "party girl" image, they might discriminate against her rather than adhere to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>. Many believed Baez's ability to control the narrative and connect with the jury, despite the damming evidence, played a significant role in the unexpected "not guilty" verdict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.

The case highlighted the profound impact of [[media_influence_on_legal_proceedings | media influence]] and public perception on legal proceedings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.

From: [[jcs]] <br/> 

The story of two-year-old Kaylee Anthony is tragic, epitomizing her short life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Kaylee sadly passed away at some point between 1 PM and 8 PM on June 16, 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, the primary focus of this narrative is the disturbing and perplexing psychological constitution of her mother, 22-year-old Casey Marie Anthony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The case is exceptional because the discussion often centers less on the crime's actual occurrences and more on the subsequent developments and the manner in which Casey responded to her daughter's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Even affording Casey the most morally acceptable possibility of what occurred, her conduct was unimaginably cold-blooded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. During her time in custody, two clinical psychologists evaluated her, finding no abnormalities related to her psychological state or signs of mental illness whatsoever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This makes the character study of [[psychological_analysis_of_casey_anthony | Casey Anthony]] both fascinating and terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Initial Report and Investigation

On July 15, 2008, Orlando police received a 911 call from Cindy Anthony, Kaylee's grandmother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Cindy reported that her granddaughter had been missing for a month and stated that [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_legal_proceedings | Casey Anthony]] finally admitted the baby was "gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Cindy also mentioned finding Casey's car, which smelled like "a dead body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

When the 911 dispatcher spoke to Casey, she claimed her daughter had been missing for 31 days and identified the supposed kidnapper as a nanny named "Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez" (or "Zanny") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Casey's Fabricated Story

A month prior, Casey had left the family home with Kaylee, claiming a work assignment in Tampa and continuous travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Despite repeated requests from Kaylee's grandparents to see or speak with her, Casey always claimed to be busy with work and that Kaylee was with "Zaneda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

On July 15, six weeks after Kaylee was last seen by her grandparents, George Anthony received a call that the family car was impounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Upon retrieving it, George detected a strong odor from the trunk, which he recognized from his police officer years as similar to human decomposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Casey was later found at her boyfriend's house, smoking marijuana and watching TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. When asked about Kaylee, she claimed the babysitter had kidnapped her 31 days prior, leading to Cindy's 911 call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

During the 911 call, Casey's voice showed no urgency or concern, and information had to be extracted through repeated questioning, contrasting sharply with her mother's distraught demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Police immediately suspected Casey, interviewing her as a witness to gather her lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### The Unraveling Lies

During her interview with Detective Melissa, Casey claimed to have known Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez for almost four years, meeting her through a mutual friend, Jeffrey Michael Hopkins, at Universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. However, when Jeffrey Hopkins was interviewed, he stated he was only "acquaintances" with Casey Anthony, never introduced her to Zaneda, never used Zaneda as a nanny, and didn't have children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Furthermore, Casey claimed a co-worker named Juliette Lewis at Universal, but "Juliette Lewis" did not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Casey had briefly worked at Universal but hadn't been employed there for over two years prior to this interview and was not an event coordinator but sold photos from a kiosk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Casey stated she didn't call the police sooner because she was "naive enough to think that I could handle this myself" and was "scared that something would happen to her if I did notify the authorities or got the media involved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

Casey then led investigators to numerous fake addresses and her "supposed office" at Universal Studios, eventually admitting she didn't work there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. She was arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

In a subsequent interrogation, Casey maintained her lies, claiming she legitimately hadn't seen her daughter in five weeks and trusted her with someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Detectives pressed her on why she lied, to which she responded, "because I'm scared and I know I'm running out of options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Despite being told she was painted as a "cold-blooded callus monster," she reiterated her belief that Kaylee was "with someone else" who had hidden her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

## Casey's Behavior in Custody

While in county jail, Casey's nonchalant demeanor continued. In a phone call with her mother, Cindy expressed anger about Casey lying, but Casey dismissed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. She even told her family not to come to her first bond hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

Nine days into her custody, Casey received her first visit from her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Despite being told Kaylee's face would be on People magazine (with a readership of over 46 million adults), Casey's response was almost as if it was a lost cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

During the visit, Casey showed brief moments of vulnerability and expressed pain for herself, but notably, no emotion was displayed when she saw her deceased daughter's face on her father's shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. Her parents tried to extract information about Kaylee's whereabouts, but Casey dismissed their questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. She criticized people trying to help with the search, calling some "psycho" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. Casey maintained her fabricated details about Zaneda, including her full name and family history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

At one point, Casey stated her gut told her Kaylee was "okay" and "not far," a statement that would later be chillingly accurate given where the remains were found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.

## Arrest for Murder and Interrogation

After just over a month in custody, Casey was released on August 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Two months later, police were granted permission to arrest her on the charge of first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>. During her interrogation, Casey immediately requested her right to counsel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.

The released footage from this period is described as bizarre and comical, as Casey effortlessly maintained a confident and talkative disposition despite being accused of her daughter's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. She agreed with the detective's assertions that he knew she was lying and guilty but offered no information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. She casually discussed the grand jury and media surrounding her murder trial as if it were a TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.

When a detective relayed the agonizing moments of her father providing testimony that led to her indictment, Casey showed no tears or rage, which would be expected from an innocent person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. She maintained her composure, confidently asserting that her attorney had agreed to sit down with police, a claim a defense attorney would never make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>. Even when directly confronted with evidence of her guilt, she deflected with absurd dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

## Psychological Insights into Casey's Behavior

Casey's behavior in the footage was likely entirely fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. She was accustomed to faking a poised temperament, even in extreme situations, a trait that might go unnoticed in everyday life but stood out under the microscope of a criminal case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>. It's asserted that Casey used this fabricated character to mask her anxiety and conceal guilty behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>. This mindset is linked to sociopathy, where individuals need to maintain an advantage and calculate their reactions before situations occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>. Her entire focus was on making herself look good, rather than the quality of her character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## Discovery of Remains and Pre-Trial Conduct

On December 11, 2008, just under five months after she was reported missing, Kaylee's skeletal remains were discovered in a swamp less than a mile from the Anthony household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. She was found wrapped in a Winnie-the-Pooh blanket, placed in a canvas laundry bag, with duct tape around the nose and mouth area of her skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. Her death was ruled a homicide, and prosecutors sought the death penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

Evidence revealed that on the last day Kaylee was seen alive by anyone other than her mother, June 16, 2008, Casey made internet searches for "How to make chloroform" and "neck breaking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>. That same evening, Casey and her boyfriend, Tony, were seen at a Blockbuster video store, with Kaylee nowhere in sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

In the following weeks, Casey went out partying, participated in a "hot body contest" just three days after Kaylee's supposed abduction, and got a tattoo reading "Bella Vita" (beautiful life) twelve days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. Her diary entry around the same time read: "I completely trust my own judgment and I knew that I made the right decision. This is the happiest that I have been in a very long time. I hope that my happiness will continue to grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.

## The Trial

The trial commenced on May 24, 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

### Prosecution's Argument

The prosecution argued that Casey suffocated Kaylee with duct tape, kept her body in a trunk for a few days, and then disposed of it in the swamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. Their primary focus was the motive: Kaylee's death allowed [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_legal_proceedings | Casey Anthony]] to live a "good life" for 31 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>. They emphasized that no one saw Kaylee alive again after Casey left with her on June 16, 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>, and that only Casey had access to all the pieces of evidence (duct tape, laundry bag, blanket, car) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>.

### Defense's Argument

The defense, led by Jose Baez, dropped a "bombshell" in their opening statements to create doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. They claimed Kaylee Anthony died on June 16, 2008, when she drowned in the family's swimming pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. They posited that Casey hid the death due to a lifetime of "hiding her pain" and keeping "secret things" within the family, stemming from alleged sexual abuse by her father, George Anthony, since she was eight years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>. This, the defense argued, taught Casey to lie and pretend nothing happened, explaining why no one knew her child was dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>.

The defense focused on theoretical arguments and "every conspiracy under the sun" to foster skepticism and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>. Jose Baez's ability to control the narrative, tell stories, and connect with the jury was noted as exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>.

In closing arguments, Baez stressed that the jury should base its verdict on evidence, not emotion, and that if they had questions about how Kaylee died, the prosecution had not met its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. He argued that the prosecution's strategy was to make the jury hate Casey so they would discriminate against her rather than uphold the standard of reasonable doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>.

## Verdict and Aftermath

On July 5, 2011, the jury rendered its verdict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. Casey Anthony was found **not guilty** of first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>, aggravated child abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>, and aggravated manslaughter of a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>.

Her attorney, Jose Baez, stated after the verdict: "Casey did not murder Kaylee. It's that simple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. He also condemned the media and lawyers who he believed had engaged in "media assassination for three years with bias and prejudice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.

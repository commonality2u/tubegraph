## Verdict and Sentencing
On the afternoon of the verdict, the jury announced their decision shortly before noon, finding the defendant Stephanie Eileen Lazarus guilty of the murder of Sherri Rasmussen [00:22:33]. The murder was further found to be of the first degree [00:23:02]. Stephanie Lazarus was sentenced to 27 years to life for the murder of Sherri Rasmussen [00:24:45].

## John Ruetten's Statement
John Ruetten, Sherri Rasmussen's husband, spoke at the hearing, expressing the profound loss experienced [00:23:16]. He stated that there are "really no words that can describe the loss of sherry" [00:23:16]. The experience thrust the Rasmussen family, his family, and Stephanie's family into "a bizarre world of disbelief and indescribable sadness" [00:23:28].

Ruetten reflected on Sherri's character, noting her "profound impact on so many people" [00:23:37]. He expressed pride that she agreed to be his wife and vividly recalled the first moment he saw her, describing her physical presence as "startling" [00:23:45]. He added that his heart still races when he looks at pictures of her [00:24:00]. Beyond her appearance, Sherri was "extraordinary" for her character, being a "hard worker, a consummate professional, a leader, a diplomat, forgiving, tough and a kid at heart" [00:24:03]. The realization that Sherri's death occurred because she met and married him "brings him to his knees" [00:24:40].

## Broader Impact
The loss of Sherri, the manner of her death, and the trial held 25 years after her passing, had a "profound impact on many many others" [00:24:16]. The effects were broad, spanning a generation and creating pain for those whose lives "should have never been touched by this tragic event" [00:24:25]. Ruetten emphasized that words are "feeble tools" for describing these impacts, highlighting "so many moments and so very many tears" [00:24:32].

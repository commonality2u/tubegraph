Interrogations and polygraph examinations often involve specific [[interrogation_techniques_and_analysis | psychological techniques]] designed to elicit truthful responses and analyze suspect behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Behavior-Provoking Questions

One such technique is the "behavior-provoking question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This type of question aims to observe how an individual responds when asked about potential consequences for the crime under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

*   **Innocent Person Response**: An innocent person typically provides a "draconian response," immediately suggesting the harshest possible sentence for the falsely accused crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For example, when asked what should happen to the person who took the children, an innocent individual might suggest "life in prison" if the children are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, or even the death penalty if the children are not alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Deceptive Individual Response**: A deceptive individual will often give an "equivocating response," fragmenting and diverting from the question to avoid answering it directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For example, a deceptive person might focus on the children coming home safe rather than the perpetrator's punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, or question the legality of a penalty in their state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Interrogation Techniques Prior to Polygraph

Before a [[polygraph_in_criminal_investigations | polygraph test]], interrogators may employ various [[police_interrogation_strategies | psychological dynamics]] and [[detective_interrogation_techniques | techniques]] to influence the suspect's mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Amplifying Anxiety

Interrogators are often receptive to a suspect's anxiety and may try to amplify this emotion before ending an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This is done to increase the suspect's apprehension for an upcoming [[polygraph_in_criminal_investigations | polygraph test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. They might describe the sleeplessness and racing thoughts the suspect will experience, encouraging them to call when these thoughts lead to a desire to disclose more information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Passive Accusation and Reframing

Another technique involves subtle [[psychological_techniques_in_suspect_interviews | psychological pressure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

> "The following discourse from the officer could be construed as the reframing technique, where an interrogator will try and shift the suspect's view of themselves from negative to positive as a means to lightening the iniquity of their crimes and increasing the chances of a confession. However, this is more likely what is known as passive accusation, where the interrogator is almost certain of the suspect's guilt and indirectly accuses and in some manner indignifies the suspect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

This is made evident by giving high praise for trivial deeds, such as a father getting his children second pairs of clothes, cooking eggs, or giving snacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## The Polygraph Test Process

The [[polygraph_in_criminal_investigations | polygraph]] is not foolproof, but a heightened state of anxiety makes it considerably more challenging to "beat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Pre-Test Phase

During the pre-test phase, the polygrapher will:
*   **Obtain the examinee's version of facts**: The polygrapher will ask the examinee for their account of the events under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Discuss ways to cause disappearance/murder**: This is a [[psychological_techniques_in_suspect_interviews | psychological pressure]] disguised as routine questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. The interrogator wants the suspect to go through these scenarios in their head to understand exactly what is being asked when questions about causing a disappearance are posed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
    *   Examples of physical ways to cause disappearance through murder include stabbing, shooting, hitting with a blunt object, strangling, drowning, or burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
    *   Other methods to cause disappearance could include kidnapping, taking someone to another country, or burying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **Psychological pressure disguised as reassurance**: The polygrapher will emphasize their advanced training and the accuracy of the test, reassuring the suspect that if they are innocent, the polygraph will prove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. However, this is a [[psychological_techniques_in_suspect_interviews | psychological technique]] used when the suspect's guilt is almost conclusive, aiming to increase their anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Directed Lie Test

The polygraph often employs a "directed lie polygraph" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. In this test, the examinee is explicitly instructed to lie on certain questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. The polygrapher explains that there are two ways to fail the test:
1.  Failing to follow instructions (e.g., not sitting still or answering questions correctly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
2.  Choosing to lie about involvement in the disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

#### Question Types

The directed lie test has three types of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>:
*   **Known Truth Questions**: Easy questions (e.g., "Are you sitting down?") used to establish a baseline reading for when the subject is telling the truth and to disconnect thought patterns between questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. These should elicit very little bodily response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Control Questions**: Questions that the polygrapher instructs the examinee to purposely lie about (e.g., "Before 2018, did you ever lose your temper with someone you cared about?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. These are designed so all answers will be "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
*   **Relevant Questions**: Questions specific to the crime being investigated, which the examinee is expected to answer truthfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. A guilty subject will show a much stronger reaction to these questions than to control questions, even if lying on both, due to the immediate threat posed by the relevant questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Polygraph Results and Post-Test Interrogation

After the polygraph, the polygrapher may initially give a compliment to boost the suspect's confidence, only to then abruptly reveal the true findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

For instance, the polygrapher might state that the suspect is a "really bad liar" and that their significant physiological reactions during the control questions indicate they know it's wrong to lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. This sets the stage for the revelation that any lies about the actual crime would be "10 times more amplified" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. The polygrapher then announces the test results, making it "completely clear" that the suspect was not honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. This direct challenge is designed to prompt a confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

For example, in the [[chris_watts_interrogation_and_polygraph_test | Chris Watts interrogation and polygraph test]], the polygrapher tells him, "it is completely clear that you were not honest during the testing and I think you already know that...he did not pass the polygraph test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. This direct accusation after the polygraph test is a common [[police_interrogation_tactics | police interrogation tactic]] to encourage disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

In the investigation into the disappearance of Savannah Gold, detectives meticulously planned their approach to [[interrogation techniques|interrogation]] to gain a significant advantage over potential suspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This careful planning extended to how and when evidence, such as surveillance footage, would be revealed, aiming to prevent suspects from altering their alibis to fit the evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Initial Investigative Steps

Following Savannah Gold's disappearance on August 2, 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, investigators briefly interviewed staff at the Bonefish Grill, where she worked, asking three main questions:
*   When was the last time you saw Savannah? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>
*   Do you know where she is? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>
*   Is there anything you know that could help with our investigation? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>

Within 48 hours, they identified three potential suspects, one of whom, Leroy Daugherty, owned a vehicle matching one seen in surveillance footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Dougherty, a manager and head chef at the restaurant, had initially claimed he hadn't seen Savannah in three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>, but co-workers revealed he was having an on-and-off relationship with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## Psychological Strategies in Interrogation

The [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques|interrogation]] of Leroy Daugherty showcased several deliberate [[interrogation strategies and techniques|interrogation strategies and techniques]] designed to manipulate suspect behavior and elicit a confession.

### The Anxiety Period
Upon arrest for an outstanding traffic warrant, Leroy Daugherty was left alone in the interrogation room for 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. This period was intended to induce anxiety, allowing a guilty suspect's thoughts to "fester and slowly intensify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. The sudden appearance of the detective who had interviewed him previously about Savannah's disappearance would instantly convert any brief relief into shock, magnifying his fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

### Open-Ended Questions
Detectives began with an open-ended question, giving Daugherty "total freedom and flexibility" to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. The theory behind this [[interrogation techniques and strategy|technique]] is that truthful subjects give short, concise responses, while those with "something to hide" are more likely to give lengthy, detailed responses in an attempt to "seek approval" or "appease" the interrogator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

Daugherty's response, detailing his on-and-off relationship with Savannah, her alleged drug use, and their eventual breakup due to her "bringing heroin over," was lengthy and detailed, fitting the profile of someone seeking approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. He initially maintained he hadn't seen her in weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

### Amending the Alibi and Locking in Lies
Knowing they had surveillance footage, investigators allowed Daugherty to amend his alibi, admitting he saw Savannah on Wednesday afternoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. He then fabricated a story about a verbal argument in the parking lot and claimed Savannah got out of his car and left in another truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.

The detectives, aware of the surveillance footage, pretended to believe this new narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>. This tactic, known as "getting the suspect to let his guard down," aims to increase the suspect's belief that they are fooling the detectives, thereby diminishing their anxiety and allowing them to commit to the fabricated story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>. This "locked" Daugherty into an alibi that could later be disproven with the undisclosed evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.

### Confrontation and Disorientation
After establishing a false sense of security, the detectives initiated the first confrontation, catching Daugherty off-guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>. This involved a "sharp and very sudden switch" in the emotional tone, aiming to disorient the suspect and impair their ability to think critically or fabricate emotions convincingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>. This included questioning his self-inflicted neck injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>.

A more aggressive confrontation followed, directly accusing Daugherty of involvement in Savannah's disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>. Innocent subjects typically "reciprocate this aggression" or refute the allegation forcefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:07:00">[23:07:00]</a>. Daugherty's "composed demeanor" suggested he had anticipated this confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>.

### Revealing Key Evidence
At a "critical moment," the female detective revealed the crucial surveillance footage, stating directly: "she never got out of your car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a> and "we can prove that you left with her in the car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>. This was the "most substantial piece of evidence" used to maximize pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>.

### Lowering the Gauge of Admission
The detectives then used specific [[interrogation strategies and suspect confession|interrogation strategies]] to lower Daugherty's resistance to confessing:
*   **How and Why Solution**: This technique minimizes the motivations behind the crime by shifting blame, for example, suggesting Savannah's alleged drug use led to an overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>.
*   **Alternative Question**: Offering a more "morally accepting choice for what happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>, such as asking if it was an overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:05:00">[28:05:00]</a>.

Despite the pressure, Daugherty initially did not fall for these specific traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[28:08:00]</a>, continuing to deny the video's implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a>.

### Relentless Pressure and Breakthrough
Detectives relentlessly applied pressure, appealing to his sense of morality and calling him "not that cruel inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>. They begged him to tell them where she went <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>. This persistence led to a breakthrough when Daugherty finally amended his story, admitting "we went to my house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>. This "lowering the level of admission" showed he could still be influenced and provided a new foundation for the investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46:00">[31:46:00]</a>.

## Confession and Aftermath
Under continued pressure, including a stark reminder that Savannah "kicked that door three times," Daugherty confessed to killing Savannah Gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:18:00">[32:18:00]</a>. He claimed to have broken her neck, then burned her body in a fire pit at his house before dumping her in a lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:23:00">[33:23:00]</a>. Savannah's body had injuries to over 75% of her body, and the medical examiner concluded it was a violent homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:00">[33:40:00]</a>.

Footage released after the confession showed Daugherty experiencing "an emotional reckoning," overwhelmed by his decision and the terrifying prospect of his immediate situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>.

Despite his confession, Daugherty later pled not guilty, claiming self-defense against Savannah, who was significantly smaller than him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a>. He alleged she slapped him multiple times, and he accidentally broke her neck when grabbing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:23:00">[39:23:00]</a>.

Solving cold cases, particularly those involving long-standing crimes, presents unique challenges for investigators. The successful resolution often relies on a combination of strategic [[interrogation techniques and strategies used by detectives | interrogation techniques]], careful observation of suspect behavior, and the application of modern forensic science, such as DNA evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## Investigative Strategies in Cold Cases

Detectives must employ sophisticated methods when re-engaging with suspects in cold cases. A primary challenge is dealing with individuals who may have rehearsed their narrative or genuinely believe they have escaped detection for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### The Ruse and Setting the Tone
One effective [[interrogation techniques used by detectives | interrogation technique]] involves creating a "ruse" to bring a suspect into an interview environment without immediately alarming them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For instance, detectives might invite a suspect under the guise of seeking advice on an unrelated case, such as stolen art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

It is crucial to establish a compatible tone with the suspect from the outset, negating the negative implications of an [[interrogation techniques and strategies used by detectives | interrogation room]] environment through a friendly disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This approach can also be used to disarm suspects, such as requiring them to check in firearms before entering a secure area under a plausible, non-suspicious reason like avoiding rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Gradual Confrontation
The plan of attack typically involves keeping the conversation as casual as possible for as long as possible, waiting for key moments to initiate confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. When introducing the core topic, detectives may use subtle [[interrogation strategies used by detectives | strategies]], like mispronouncing a key name, to observe the suspect's reaction and assess their immediate cognitive processing and emotional response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Detecting Deception in Criminal Cases
[[Detecting deception in criminal cases | Deception detection]] is a critical component of [[investigative techniques in crime cases | crime investigation]]. Suspects often exhibit various behavioral cues when fabricating or concealing information.

### Behavioral Indicators of Deception
*   **Prolonged Pauses**: An unusually long pause when asked about a significant person or event can indicate deception, as the suspect may be constructing a false narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For example, a pause four times longer than it should have been suggested deception, even when the name was deeply "engraved in her memory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Omission of Key Information**: Truthful subjects often volunteer relevant information without being pressed. Suspects may omit significant details about a past relationship or event, forcing detectives to ask direct questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Exclamatory Remarks and Vague Memory**: Frequent use of exclamatory remarks like "gosh" or "god" can be a tactic to feign surprise or strong emotion, attempting to insinuate a vague memory due to a lack of contemplation on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This creates the impression that the suspect had no reason to think about the incriminating subject matter for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Acting Naive to Confrontation**: Guilty suspects often try to appear oblivious to a blatant confrontation as a means of avoiding it altogether, whereas truthful subjects will address it directly and seek clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Over-Explanation and Terror Management Theory (TMT)**: Over-explaining trivial details that don't require an explanation can be a sign of "hyper-arousal" or a subconscious coping mechanism known as Terror Management Theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This allows the suspect momentary relief from the terrifying reality by going off on unrelated tangents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Emotional Response**: A suspect may pretend to be in a reflective state for questions they already know the answers to, but their facial expression may genuinely change when they are forced to search their memory for unknown information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## The Role of DNA Evidence in Cold Cases
Modern [[forensic investigative process | forensic investigative processes]] significantly enhance the ability to solve cold cases. The ability to collect and analyze DNA evidence is a game-changer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

### Confronting with DNA
Detectives can use the potential for DNA evidence to pressure suspects. Presenting the possibility that DNA may have been found at the crime scene can lead to confessions or a request for legal counsel, which can itself be a tell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. The request for a DNA swab, or "buckle swab," is a key step in this process, used to either "identify or eliminate" individuals from the investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

### Outcomes
Even after decades, the application of modern [[forensic investigative process | forensic methods]] and expert [[interrogation techniques used by detectives | interrogation techniques]] can lead to a resolution. In one notable case, a suspect, Stephanie Lazarus, was found guilty of first-degree murder for a crime committed over two decades prior, highlighting the enduring impact of [[crime details and investigation | crime investigation]] advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. She was sentenced to 27 years to life for the murder of Sherry Rasmussen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.

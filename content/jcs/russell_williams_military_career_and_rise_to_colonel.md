Russell Williams embarked on his military journey by enrolling in the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. His ascent through the ranks was swift and notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Promotions and Command

By January 1, 1991, Williams had been promoted to Captain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. In this role, he was addressed as "sir" by his subordinates and "captain Williams" by his superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. His reputation as an "elite pilot" and a "shining bright star" within the military fueled his rapid career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

His significant promotion to Colonel came in June 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Concurrently, he was appointed Commanding Officer at CFB Trenton, which stands as Canada's largest air force base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This position placed him in full command of over 7,000 military personnel, all of whom referred to him as "colonel" or "colonel Williams" without exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Perceived Authority and Confidence

Williams's designated title as Colonel was prominently displayed on all forms of his identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Every formal interaction served to reinforce his military standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Figures of authority, such as doctors, lawyers, or police officers, traditionally recognized and adhered to the courtesy of addressing him by his professional rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This consistent recognition is believed to have significantly boosted his composure and self-assurance, accentuating his elevated social standing and military achievements for all to observe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

However, this unwavering respect and self-assurance would reportedly encounter an exception on the day he encountered Detective Sergeant Jim Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

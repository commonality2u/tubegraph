[[police_interrogation_strategies | Police interrogation strategies]] are employed by law enforcement to gather information and elicit confessions from suspects. These techniques often involve psychological manipulation and strategic questioning to create a sense of discomfort, then relief, and ultimately to secure a confession.

## Initial Stages of Interrogation

### Creating Anxiety and Uncertainty
Upon arrest, a suspect may be informed of a minor charge, such as an outstanding traffic warrant, before being left alone in the interrogation room for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. This isolation, as seen with Leroy Daugherty, allows anxiety to fester and intensify, gradually diminishing any initial optimism the suspect might have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. The appearance of a previously encountered investigator, rather than the arresting officer, signals the true gravity of the situation, further escalating the suspect's fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

### Strategic Information Control
Investigators carefully control the flow of information during an interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. They avoid revealing the full extent of their evidence, such as surveillance footage, to prevent a suspect from altering their alibi to fit the known facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This tactic preserves a significant advantage for investigators during questioning and helps in building a stronger case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

## Questioning and Psychological Dynamics

### Open-Ended Questions
[[interrogation_techniques | Interrogation techniques]] often begin with open-ended questions, granting the suspect "total freedom and flexibility" in their response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Suspect Behavior in Response to Open-Ended Questions
> It is commonly believed that individuals with "nothing to hide" provide short, concise answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. Conversely, those attempting to conceal something are more likely to give lengthy, detailed responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. This is because deceptive subjects seek approval and view the interrogator as an "imminent threat" to appease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Truthful subjects, having no fear, see the interrogator as a "mere inconvenience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

### Inducing Admissions
When a suspect suspects that investigators possess some evidence, they may be compelled to amend their alibi to some degree and offer a partial admission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>. This allows investigators to move closer to a full confession while still concealing the full extent of their evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

### False Sense of Security and Confrontation
[[interrogation_techniques_and_strategies | Interrogation techniques and strategies]] include creating a false sense of security by pretending to believe the suspect's fabricated story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>. This lowers the suspect's guard, reduces anxiety, and increases their belief that they are succeeding in deceiving the detectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>. This strategy is deployed to "catch the suspect completely off-guard" when the first confrontation is initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>. The sudden shift in emotion can disorient a suspect and impair their ability to think critically or fabricate convincing lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.

### Direct Accusation
A more aggressive confrontation involves directly accusing the suspect of involvement in the disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. Innocent subjects typically "reciprocate this aggression" and refute the allegation forcefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:07:00">[23:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09:00">[23:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>. A composed or anticipated response suggests the suspect expected such a confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>.

### The Revelation of Evidence
The most substantial piece of evidence, such as surveillance footage, is revealed at a pivotal moment to maximize pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:49:00">[25:49:00]</a>. This forces the suspect to confront undeniable facts, particularly when their previous narrative is directly contradicted by the evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:23:00">[26:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>.

### "How and Why Solution" and "Alternative Question"
These [[interrogation_techniques_and_analysis | interrogation techniques and analysis]] are used to lower the perceived severity of admission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:43:00">[27:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:45:00">[27:45:00]</a>.
*   **"How and Why Solution"**: Blames the victim or minimizes the motivations behind the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:55:00">[27:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>.
*   **"Alternative Question"**: Presents the suspect with a more "morally accepting choice" for what might have occurred, planting a seed for a less incriminating confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:05:00">[28:05:00]</a>.

### Relentless Pressure and Appeal to Morality
[[criminal_interrogation_techniques | Criminal interrogation techniques]] involve attacking the suspect's character while simultaneously appealing to their sense of morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>. This often includes emphasizing the victim's family's right to knowledge and closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[29:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:18:00">[29:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>. Interrogators may repeatedly ask for the location of the victim and express their own emotional investment in finding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:59:00">[24:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>. They might also highlight inconsistencies and reiterate that evidence, like video footage, "doesn't lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:00">[27:12:00]</a>. This sustained pressure aims to wear down the suspect and elicit a confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>.

## Conclusion and Confession

The goal of these [[detective_interrogation_techniques | detective interrogation techniques]] is to secure a confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>. Once a suspect begins to amend their story, even slightly, it provides a new platform for investigators to build upon and further chip away at their resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46:00">[31:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:48:00">[31:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:00">[31:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:58:00">[31:58:00]</a>. In the case of Leroy Daugherty, this culminated in his admission to killing Savannah Gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:23:00">[33:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:25:00">[33:25:00]</a>. The moment of confession is often followed by profound emotional distress as the suspect processes the implications of their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:09:00">[34:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:25:00">[35:25:00]</a>.

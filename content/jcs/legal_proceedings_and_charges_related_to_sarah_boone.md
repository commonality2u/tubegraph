On February 25, 2020, 42-year-old Sarah Boone called 9-1-1 to report that her boyfriend, 42-year-old George Torres Jr., was dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. She explained to the dispatcher that they were playing hide-and-seek the night before, and she put him in a suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. She then fell asleep and woke up to find him dead in the suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. George Torres Jr. ultimately died of suffocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Sarah's initial explanation was that it was a totally unintentional and unforeseen accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Initial Investigation and Discovery of Evidence
Upon arrival, officers began their investigation. Sarah's ex-husband, who she called over, informed police that George was currently on parole for domestic violence against Sarah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. He stated that George had been arrested multiple times for domestic violence against Sarah, and she had bailed him out each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

During initial questioning, Sarah reiterated her story, claiming George got into the suitcase, and she zipped him up jokingly, then fell asleep upstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. She denied ever having zipped him up in anything prior to this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Investigators found two videos on Sarah's phone that contradicted her story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### The Videos
*   **First Video**: Taken at 11:12 PM, it shows Sarah laughing at George while he is zipped up in the suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. George is not laughing; he is asking to be let out and repeatedly states that he cannot breathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Sarah can be heard saying, "For everything you've done to me" and "Your battery's about to die, shut it down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. She also tells George, "You stupid, stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   **Second Video**: Recorded 11 minutes later, it shows the same scene, but the suitcase is flipped over and in a different area of the apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Sarah admits to flipping the suitcase over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

Sarah appeared heavily intoxicated in these videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Autopsy and Forensics
The autopsy revealed injuries to George's left shoulder, a cut near his lip, and bruising on his forehead and skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Forensics confirmed these injuries occurred the night he died and were not present before he entered the apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Sarah denied causing any injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Interrogation and Charges
Sarah returned to the Sheriff's Office the day after George's death, armed with a handwritten list of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Investigators then showed her the videos from her phone.

During the interrogation, Sarah's demeanor shifted drastically:
*   She initially claimed no recollection of the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   When confronted with George's pleas of "I can't breathe," Sarah claimed he was "the boy calling wolf" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
*   She blamed her actions on alcohol, stating, "I'm blaming it on the wine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.
*   She repeatedly stated her intention was not to leave him in the suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   When asked why she didn't let him out, she said she went upstairs and fell asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   She acknowledged being "mad" in the video but denied it was malicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

When asked if she was trying to punish George, Sarah denied it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. However, the interrogator highlighted her statement in the video, "This is what you got, this is what you make me feel like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>, and later, "This is what it feels like when you're choking me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

After presenting all the evidence, an investigator directly asked Sarah, "You realize you're the person that killed him, right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a> Sarah maintained, "Not intentionally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

Near the end of the interrogation, Sarah was asked to give a solemn declaration of her statements. Despite her visible distress, she agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

At 5:44 PM, Sarah Boone was taken to the Orange County Jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Charges and Sentencing
> Sarah Boone was charged with **second-degree murder** and held without bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. This occurred in late February 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

Sarah has been in county jail since, and at the time of the transcript, her trial date was set for April 10th of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>. She has reportedly worked with her seventh attorney, as six previous attorneys filed motions to withdraw, citing "irreconcilable differences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

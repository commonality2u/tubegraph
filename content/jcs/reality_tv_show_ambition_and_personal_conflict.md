David Tronnes, a 50-year-old stay-at-home husband, harbored a strong desire to appear on reality television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. In late April 2018, he successfully secured a spot on the show *Zombie House Flipping*, where he was to be featured renovating his recently purchased house with his then-wife, 39-year-old financial consultant Shanti Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Core Conflict

The central issue arose from Shanti Cooper's lack of interest in being on television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. She refused to sign off on the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This refusal directly led to [[the_crime_and_deception | David beating and strangling Shanti to death]] in the early hours of the following morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## David's Ambition

David Tronnes's motivation for the show included significant financial incentives, referred to as "tradeouts" and "promotional sponsorships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. These would provide high-end materials like quartz countertops and premium cabinets instead of mid-range options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. He also claimed that participating in the show would allow Shanti to eventually quit her job or slowly phase out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

Despite later telling detectives the show was "just the house" and "they're the stars" (referring to the hosts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, David fully understood he would be prominently featured as the main builder and construction person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## Shanti's Reluctance

Keith Ary, the producer of *Zombie House Flipping*, explained that it was difficult to get both David and Shanti together for a meeting. He insisted on a formal sit-down with Shanti to ensure she was fully on board with the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Ary observed that Shanti was "unhappy" to be there and the atmosphere was "tense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. She stayed only as long as absolutely necessary before leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This meeting occurred just six days before her murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Underlying [[family_dynamics_and_conflict | Relationship Dynamics]]

The pressure of the renovation added stress to their [[family_dynamics_and_conflict | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. David admitted to a brief argument with Shanti over the renovation on the Saturday before the murder, primarily concerning the wavy upstairs floor and the extensive work required to flatten it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. However, he downplayed it, claiming they were both upset about the delay rather than fighting with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

Further tension was revealed by their living arrangement: Shanti primarily slept upstairs in the comfortable part of the residence, while David slept downstairs in the garage with the dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. This arrangement had been ongoing for over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

## The Aftermath and Trial

During his interrogation, David maintained his account of finding Shanti unresponsive, denying any physical harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. He insisted he did not choke, strangle, or beat her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. His defense during the trial was that he was out walking the dogs when an unknown intruder murdered Shanti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

The prosecution countered that a stranger would not take the time to strangle someone, move them to a tub, leave nothing behind, and inflict such severe injuries (fractured skull, swollen eyes, intense bruising) without taking anything or leaving evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. The prosecution argued that the significant injuries on Shanti's body were inconsistent with a fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>, and that she was deceased before David supposedly left the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

David Tronnes was found guilty of first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a> and sentenced to life imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>. His extreme ambition for reality television and Shanti's refusal to partake ultimately culminated in her death.

[[psychological_analysis_of_suspect_behavior | Psychological analysis of suspect behavior]] and various [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation techniques]] are often employed by law enforcement during suspect interviews to elicit truthful information or confessions. These [[detective_interrogation_techniques | techniques]] range from specific questioning strategies to the application of psychological pressure during polygraph examinations.

## Behavior-Provoking Questions

One specific [[police_interrogation_strategies | police interrogation strategy]] involves the use of "behavior-provoking questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These questions are designed to elicit distinct responses depending on the suspect's guilt or innocence.

*   **Draconian Response**
    An innocent person typically provides a "draconian response," immediately suggesting the harshest possible sentence for the crime they are falsely accused of committing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

*   **Equivocating Response**
    A deceptive individual, conversely, often gives an "equivocating response." This involves fragmenting or diverting from the question to avoid a direct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For example, when asked what should be done with a perpetrator, a deceptive individual might focus on the victims' safety instead of the perpetrator's punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> or question the legality of severe penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Psychological Dynamics in Interrogations

[[psychological_dynamics_in_police_interrogations | Psychological dynamics in police interrogations]] are crucial, with interrogators employing several tactics to manage a suspect's emotional state and encourage cooperation.

*   **Confronting Discrepancies**
    Interrogators may confront suspects with information they already know to be false, such as a suspect's denial of infidelity when the interrogator has evidence of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. They can also recover deleted digital exchanges from devices, even long after deletion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

*   **Amplifying Anxiety**
    Before significant steps like a polygraph test, an interrogator may deliberately amplify a suspect's anxiety and apprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This is done to increase the challenge for a guilty suspect to "beat" the polygraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

*   **Reframing Technique (Passive Accusation)**
    While sometimes appearing as a "reframing technique" to shift a suspect's self-perception from negative to positive to lessen the perceived inequity of their crimes and increase confession chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, this tactic is more likely "passive accusation." This is where the interrogator is nearly certain of guilt and indirectly accuses the suspect, often by offering high praise for trivial actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Polygraph Examination Techniques

Polygraph examinations are a key part of [[criminal_interrogation_techniques | criminal interrogation techniques]], and specific [[police_interrogation_tactics | police interrogation tactics]] are used during their administration.

*   **Psychological Pressure as Reassurance**
    During the pre-test phase, a polygrapher may apply psychological pressure disguised as reassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This technique, though not routine, is often used when the suspect's guilt is considered almost conclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The polygrapher asserts confidence in their training and ability to detect truth, implying that if the suspect is innocent, it will be proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

*   **Clarifying "Disappearance" through Scenarios**
    To ensure a suspect understands the scope of questions regarding a disappearance, the polygrapher may ask them to brainstorm ways someone could be made to disappear, including murder scenarios like stabbing, shooting, or blunt force trauma, as well as drowning or burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This ensures the suspect is fully aware that questions about causing a disappearance refer to direct physical actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

*   **Directed Lie Polygraph Test**
    This type of test includes three categories of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>:
    *   **Known Truth Questions:** Simple questions (e.g., "Are you sitting down?") used to establish a baseline for truthful responses, eliciting minimal bodily reactions, and to disconnect thought patterns between questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
    *   **Control Questions:** These are questions the suspect is instructed to purposely lie about (e.g., "Before 2018, did you ever lose your temper with someone you cared about?" and the suspect answers "No") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. They are structured so that all answers are "no" responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
    *   **Relevant Questions:** Directly related to the crime under investigation, which the examinee is expected to answer truthfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. A guilty subject will show a stronger reaction to these questions than to control questions, even if lying on both, due to the immediate threat posed by relevant questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

*   **Post-Test Confrontation**
    Following a polygraph, the examiner will interpret the results. If a suspect "fails," they are informed that their dishonesty was "completely clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. The polygrapher may first provide a momentary boost of confidence before abruptly stating the failure, emphasizing the suspect's inability to lie effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. This is often followed by a direct appeal for the truth, indicating that the truth will soon be known to more people than just the suspect and the polygrapher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

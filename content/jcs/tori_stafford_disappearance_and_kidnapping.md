On April 8, 2009, eight-year-old Tori Stafford disappeared from Oliver Stevens School in Woodstock, Ontario, after the dismissal bell rang at 3:25 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> She was last seen on surveillance footage leaving the premises two minutes later than other students, having gone back inside to retrieve her mother's butterfly earrings from her desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Tori never returned home that Wednesday afternoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Initial Investigation and Public Appeal

Tori was reported missing by her grandmother at 6:04 p.m., immediately initiating a missing-persons investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Approximately seven hours later, surveillance footage from a local high school emerged, showing Tori walking alongside an unidentified woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Tori did not appear to be struggling in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, and the woman was described as white, between 19 and 25 years old, 5 foot 2, about 125 pounds, with a black ponytail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Local police publicly appealed for the woman to come forward, and Tori's grandparents offered a $10,000 reward for her return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. A Facebook group dedicated to finding her amassed over 20,000 followers in under 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. On April 12, four days after her disappearance, hundreds gathered in Woodstock for a vigil, where Tori's mother made a tearful televised appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Tori's parents were interviewed by investigators and passed polygraph tests the following week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Ground searches were called off six days after her disappearance due to a lack of clues or leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The day after, "America's Most Wanted" featured Tori's case as its top story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. On April 17, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) took over the investigation, and ground searches resumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The case was officially reclassified as an abduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Police intensified their media campaign by releasing a composite sketch of the woman in the video, circulating it on social media and news outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Apprehension of Suspects

On May 19, police identified the woman as 18-year-old [[role_of_terry_lynn_mcclintock_in_the_crime | Terry Lynn McClintock]], who was already in custody for breaching a probation order due to a prior drug violation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. She was transferred to OPP Headquarters for an interview with Detective Sergeant Jim Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Initially, [[role_of_terry_lynn_mcclintock_in_the_crime | McClintock]] denied being the woman in the video and claimed no knowledge of the missing girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, about 45 minutes into the interrogation, she broke down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. She provided a detailed account of Tori's abduction and killing, stating she lured Tori into a secluded parking space by promising to show her a puppy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Tori was then forced into the backseat of a vehicle driven by 28-year-old Michael Rafferty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Rafferty drove to a secluded area about 100 miles north of Woodstock, where he sexually assaulted and murdered the eight-year-old, inflicting four fatal strikes to her head with a claw hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

[[role_of_terry_lynn_mcclintock_in_the_crime | McClintock]] drew a rough sketch of the crime scene, which helped police locate Tori's remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Tori was found with lacerations to her liver and sixteen broken ribs, and the cause of death matched [[role_of_terry_lynn_mcclintock_in_the_crime | Terry Lynn]]'s testimony: repeated blows to the head with a blunt object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

At 7:55 p.m. that evening, Michael Rafferty was arrested and charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Michael Rafferty's Interrogation

Michael Rafferty was brought to police headquarters for immediate interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Staff Sergeant Chris Lome, head of the OPP's Behavioral Sciences unit (specializing in criminal profiling, threat assessment, and forensic psychiatry), led the interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Interrogation Techniques

*   **Rapport Development:** Lome maintained a friendly, nonchalant disposition, aiming to appear empathetic and understanding to encourage cooperation and downplay the crime's severity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. He stated his primary purpose was to assess Rafferty's threat level, though in serious cases like rape and murder, this assessment is typically made beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The true goal was to understand Rafferty's character and influence his reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Mental Exhaustion:** The detective used a rambling style to keep Rafferty's mind racing, preventing him from formulating lies or disassociating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. This aimed to break him down through psychological stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.
*   **Undermining Confidence:** Lome constantly watched for denials and immediately stopped them, aiming to prevent Rafferty's morale, psychological endurance, and self-preservation from increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. He emphasized that Rafferty's credibility was all he had left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **"Good Cop, Bad Cop" (Mutt and Jeff) Technique:** After 95 minutes without a confession, a second investigator, Detective Smith ("Bad Cop"), entered the room, adopting an aggressive and accusatory tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>. This technique is based on the "fear-then-relief" response, where extreme emotional shifts can disorient a suspect, making them more compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. Smith presented [[role_of_terry_lynn_mcclintock_in_the_crime | Terry Lynn McClintock]]'s detailed confession, highlighting her emotional distress and cooperation, and the overwhelming forensic evidence linking Rafferty to the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. He explicitly stated that Tori's DNA was "all over" Rafferty's car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.
    *   Rafferty's demeanor throughout the interrogation was described as a "quivering mess," acting like a helpless victim seeking sympathy, a stark contrast to his actions during the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. He initially denied involvement but eventually requested food, seemingly caught between hunger and maintaining a guilt-ridden appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Despite the psychological pressure, the "Mutt and Jeff" technique was ultimately unsuccessful, as Rafferty did not confess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>.

## Verdict and Sentencing

Michael Rafferty was found guilty of murdering, kidnapping, and sexually assaulting eight-year-old Tori Stafford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. The verdict came quickly, after just over a day of jury deliberations, prompting a collective sigh of relief from friends and family in the courtroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. Both Michael Rafferty and [[role_of_terry_lynn_mcclintock_in_the_crime | Terry Lynn McClintock]] were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.

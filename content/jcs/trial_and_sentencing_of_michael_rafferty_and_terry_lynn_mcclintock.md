On April 8, 2009, eight-year-old Tori Stafford was last seen leaving Oliver Stevens School in Woodstock, Ontario, at 3:25 p.m. She had briefly returned inside to retrieve her mother's butterfly earrings from her desk, leaving two minutes after the other students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Tori never returned home and was reported missing by her grandmother at 6:04 p.m., prompting an immediate missing-persons investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## The Investigation and Discovery
Roughly seven hours after her disappearance, surveillance footage from a local high school emerged, showing Tori walking alongside an unidentified woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Tori did not appear to be struggling, and the woman was described as 19 to 25 years old, white, 5 foot 2 inches, and approximately 125 pounds, with a black ponytail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

A public appeal was made for the woman to come forward, and Tori's grandparents offered a $10,000 reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. A Facebook group dedicated to finding Tori gained over 20,000 followers within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. On April 12, a vigil was held in Woodstock, where Tori's mother made a tearful televised appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Both of Tori's parents were interviewed by investigators and passed polygraph tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Ground searches were initially called off after six days with no clues found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The case gained national attention when America's Most Wanted featured it as its top story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. On April 17, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) took over the investigation, resuming ground searches and officially reclassifying the case as an abduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. They intensified a media campaign, releasing and circulating a composite sketch of the woman seen in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## [[terry_lynn_mcclintocks_confession | Terry Lynn McClintock's Confession]]
On May 19, police identified the woman as 18-year-old [[terry_lynn_mcclintocks_confession | Terry Lynn McClintock]], who was already in custody for breaching a probation order related to a previous drug violation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. She was transferred to the Ontario Police Headquarters and interrogated by Detective Sergeant Jim Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Initially, McClintock denied being the woman in the video and claimed no knowledge of the missing girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, approximately 45 minutes into the [[terry_lynn_mcclintocks_confession | interrogation]], she broke down and confessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

[[terry_lynn_mcclintocks_confession | McClintock described in disturbing detail]] the abduction and killing of Tori Stafford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. She stated that she lured Tori into a secluded parking space with the promise of showing her a puppy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Tori was then forced into the backseat of a vehicle driven by 28-year-old Michael Rafferty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Rafferty drove to a secluded area about 100 miles north of Woodstock, where he sexually assaulted and then murdered the eight-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The fatal injuries were four strikes to the head with a claw hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

McClintock drew a rough sketch of the area where Tori was killed, which led police to discover Tori's remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Her body showed lacerations to the liver and sixteen broken ribs, but the cause of death was confirmed to be repeated blows to the head with a blunt object, consistent with McClintock's testimony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## [[interrogation_of_michael_rafferty | Interrogation of Michael Rafferty]]
At 7:55 p.m. that evening, Michael Rafferty was arrested and charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. He was read his rights and taken to police headquarters for immediate [[interrogation_of_michael_rafferty | interrogation]] by Staff Sergeant Chris Loam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Loam, a member and head of the analysis section of the OPP's highly trained Behavioral Sciences unit, employed strategies like rapport development and downplaying the crime's severity to encourage cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. He presented his purpose as assessing Rafferty's threat level, though the true aim was to understand his character and influence his decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Loam repeatedly highlighted the overwhelming evidence against Rafferty, including [[terry_lynn_mcclintocks_confession | Terry Lynn McClintock's confession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. He emphasized that Rafferty's credibility was all he had left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Rafferty remained largely silent, displaying distress and appearing as a "quivering mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The detective maintained a persistent, rambling approach to keep Rafferty's mind racing and prevent him from forming lies or disassociating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

After 95 minutes, the [[interrogation_of_michael_rafferty | interrogation]] shifted to the "Mutt and Jeff" (good cop/bad cop) technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. Another detective, Blake, took a more aggressive stance, detailing McClintock's explicit confession about Rafferty's involvement in the abduction, sexual assault, and murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. He highlighted physical evidence like Tori's blood and DNA in Rafferty's car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. Despite the intense pressure, Rafferty largely maintained his silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. The bad cop's demeanor was noted as purely emotional, without tactical purpose, aiming to psychologically grill Rafferty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. Rafferty's silence was interpreted by the detective as a sign of his guilt and lack of remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>. The "Mutt and Jeff" technique was ultimately unsuccessful in eliciting a confession from Rafferty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>.

## Trial and Sentencing
Michael Rafferty was found guilty of murdering, kidnapping, and sexually assaulting eight-year-old Tori Stafford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. The trial lasted nearly 10 weeks in London, Ontario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>. When the guilty verdicts for first-degree murder, abduction, and sexual assault were read aloud, there was a collective sigh of relief from friends and family in the courtroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:43">[00:55:43]</a>. Lawyers on both sides expressed appreciation for the jury's difficult work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. The quick verdict, deliberated in just over a day, had created a sense of anticipation for a guilty outcome among the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>.

Both Michael Rafferty and [[terry_lynn_mcclintocks_confession | Terry Lynn McClintock]] were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.

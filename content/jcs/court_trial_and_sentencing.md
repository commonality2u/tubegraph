Michael Dunn's [[Legal proceedings and trial outcomes | legal journey]] began with his arrest and subsequent [[Witness Testimonies and Police Interrogation | interrogation]] following a fatal shooting at a Jacksonville gas station. His defense and the prosecution's arguments centered on the presence of a weapon and the justification of self-defense.

## Initial Interrogation and Charges

On November 23, 2012, approximately 22 hours after the shooting, Michael Dunn was apprehended at his home in Brevard County and brought to the JSO police department for [[Witness Testimonies and Police Interrogation | interrogation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. He was read his Miranda rights and signed a document acknowledging his understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

During the [[Witness Testimonies and Police Interrogation | interrogation]], Dunn sought to portray himself as a victim who had no alternative but to act as he did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. He claimed to have politely asked the occupants of a Dodge Durango to lower their music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, which he described as "thug music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. He alleged that one of the individuals became agitated, used profanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, threatened to kill him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, and retrieved what he believed to be a shotgun or a stick from the floorboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, saying "you're dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Dunn stated he then retrieved his pistol from the glove compartment, stating he was "scared" and "in such a panic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. He admitted to firing four shots initially, and then four more shots as the vehicle fled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

Detectives noted inconsistencies and problematic aspects of his story:
*   His choice to return to the hotel, order pizza, and go to sleep instead of contacting authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
*   The lack of any weapon found in or near the victims' vehicle, contradicting Dunn's claim of seeing a shotgun or stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
*   His continued firing at the vehicle as it was backing away, which is considered a non-threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.
*   The forensic evidence showed the victim, Jordan Davis, was hit while still in the back seat with the door shut, contradicting Dunn's claim that Davis was stepping out of the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.
*   The fact that none of the other passengers or independent witnesses corroborated Dunn's claim of a death threat or seeing a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
*   The lack of a history of violence for the victim or other occupants of the Durango <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

During the [[Witness Testimonies and Police Interrogation | interrogation]], Dunn was informed that Duval County had issued an arrest warrant for murder and attempted murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>. He also learned that there was no bond for a murder charge in Duval County <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.

## Court Proceedings and Trial Statements

Michael Dunn remained in custody at the Duval County Jail for 14 months awaiting trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. During [[court_proceedings_and_trial_statements | trial statements]], his testimony showed a significant increase in emphasis and conviction compared to his initial [[Witness Testimonies and Police Interrogation | interrogation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

Dunn reiterated his claims of asking the music to be turned down, hearing threats like "kill that cracker," and seeing a barrel of a gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>. He stated he believed he was going to be killed and that the situation was a "clear and present danger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>. He claimed he didn't realize the SUV was moving when he continued to fire and was worried about a "blind firing situation" hitting himself or his fiancée, Rhonda Rower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

### Rhonda Rower's Testimony

Rhonda Rower, Dunn's fiancée, testified that Dunn never mentioned seeing a gun or any other weapon in the red SUV, neither immediately after the shooting, back at the hotel, nor during their two-hour drive home the following morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This contradicted Dunn's claim that he told her "several times" about the self-defense and a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.

## Legal Outcomes and Sentencing

On February 15, 2014, Michael Dunn was found guilty on three counts of attempted murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. He received a 90-year sentence for these charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. Seven months later, on October 1, he was given an additional life sentence without the possibility of parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>. His appeal of the verdict was denied by the First District Court on November 17, 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. He is currently incarcerated at the Oregon State Penitentiary, a maximum-security facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.

> [!INFO]
> The prosecution argued that Dunn's self-description as "horrified and shaken up" by the event was contradicted by his "boasting" about his gun handling skills and adding "dramatic pauses" during his [[Witness Testimonies and Police Interrogation | interrogation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. They also highlighted his focus on trivial details like missing an "expensive bed and breakfast" rather than expressing remorse for the victim's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. The absence of emotion when describing the moment he took a life, contrasted with his emotional display over his pet, was also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>.

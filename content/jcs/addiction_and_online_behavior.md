Grant Amato, a 29-year-old, unemployed individual living in his parents' guest house in Chuliota, Florida, began experimenting with online cam sites in mid-2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These platforms allow users to solicit live performances from models in exchange for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Using his brother's credit card, Grant spent an average of 20 minutes on multiple cam models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

On June 5th, forensics discovered he came into contact with a performer named Sylvie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Over the next six months, Grant would spend over $200,000 of his family's money on Sylvie alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This included his father's entire life savings, $60,000 from his brother's credit card, and a $65,000 loan taken out on the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This extensive spending highlights the [[virtual_relationships_and_financial_consequences | financial consequences]] of his online behavior.

## Rehabilitation and Relapse

When his family discovered the extent of his spending, they sent Grant to a behavioral rehabilitation facility for online porn addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Upon his return on January 4th, his father presented him with a two-page list of rules, one of which was to cease all communication with Sylvie immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. However, within three weeks, the family discovered he had broken the contract and re-established contact with Sylvie via Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Confrontation and Crime

On January 24th, Grant's father, Chad Amato, confronted him, leading to a heated argument that almost turned physical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Grant was subsequently kicked out of the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The next morning, Chad, Margaret, and Cody Amato were found dead from gunshot wounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Grant became the prime suspect due to the prior night's confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Interrogation and Deception

During his interrogation, Grant initially feigned ignorance about the reason for his questioning, remaining silent and not inquiring about his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. He eventually disclosed his involvement with the cam model, describing her as a "virtual girlfriend" and admitting to spending "probably close to two hundred thousand dollars" on her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. He revealed he had been lying to his family, claiming the money was for his Twitch streaming advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

Grant recounted his family's attempts to address his [[behavioral_patterns_and_personality_traits | behavior]], including his father admitting him to a "depression or an addiction clinic" called Cornerstone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. He also admitted his mother would "behind the scenes" allow him to talk to Sylvie using her cell phone via Twitter, circumventing his father's rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. He stated he felt an "emotional connection" and a "relationship" with the model, which made him reluctant to stop communication "cold turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

Grant attempted to frame his brother, Cody, for the murders, claiming Cody said he would "take care of it" after being updated by their mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This is an example of [[psychological_manipulation_and_deception | psychological manipulation and deception]].

## Forensic Evidence and Prosecution

Forensics later proved that while his mother, Margaret, was at the computer, Grant shot her in the back of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. He then waited for his father, Chad, and shot him twice in the head as he entered the kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Cody received a text from his father's number asking him to come home urgently and was found with a gunshot wound to the face, lying in the fetal position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. This evidence directly contradicts Grant's narrative, a point highlighted by [[impact_of_internet_search_history_in_forensic_investigations | internet search history]] and credit card records.

Crucially, Cody's credit card was stolen, and an estimated 30 minutes after the murders, a $600 purchase was made to a cam site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Grant used free Wi-Fi at a Publix supermarket parking lot to log on to the cam site with his dead brother's card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

Grant's trial began on August 12, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. The prosecution argued that the case was about Grant's "blind obsession with this woman" and his "absolute contempt for those that he held responsible" for the "end of the world as he believed it to be" because of his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. Grant Amato was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.

From: [[jcs]] <br/> 

In July 1980, [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi Ann Arias]] was born in Salinas, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. In February 2006, at the age of 26, she began a new job as a salesperson for a network marketing company called Pre-Paid Legal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Through this occupation, she met Travis Alexander, a 28-year-old practicing Mormon from Arizona, who also worked part-time as a motivational speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Initial Encounter and Developing Relationship
Travis was described as a very charismatic young man, which immediately caught [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi's]] attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. They met at a business conference in September 2006 and began a "curious relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] was in love, but Travis was not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. They broke up after just five months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Post-Breakup Dynamics
Soon after their split, [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] moved from her grandparents' home in Yreka, California, to an apartment just two blocks from Travis's house in Mesa, Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Travis's friends labeled her the "crazy stalker ex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Despite agreeing with this label, Travis continued to have sex with her out of pure convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] would show up unannounced on numerous occasions, sometimes in the middle of the night, and Travis would let her in every time, establishing a dysfunctional routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Travis wanted [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] out of his life, while [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] desperately desired a serious relationship, believing they were "meant to be together" based on her diary entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Turning Point: Cancun Trip
In late May 2008, [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi's]] heart would change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Travis had a work retreat planned for Cancun, Mexico, on July 10th, which was paid for by his employer and allowed him to bring a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] believed she would be the one going, but in the last week of May, it was revealed Travis was taking another woman, Mimi Hall, a Mormon girl he had been romantically interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This discovery led to [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi's]] heartbreak and rage, triggering a "specific thought process" in her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## The Day of the Murder
On June 4, 2008, six days before Travis was to leave for Mexico, [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] once again showed up unannounced at his home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. They had sex and took explicit pictures of each other with Travis's new camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Around 5 p.m., Travis entered the shower, and [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] continued taking pictures of him with the same camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Moments after one picture, [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] stabbed Travis 27 times, cut his throat, and shot him in the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Travis's camera captured two accidental photographs during the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

After the murder, [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] spent an estimated 45 minutes cleaning the crime scene to remove her DNA, including wiping Travis's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. She also deleted the pictures from his camera before throwing it in the washing machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. She then drove into the desert and left Travis a voicemail to create an alibi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

Travis's body was discovered five days later by Mimi Hall and her friends, the day before they were supposed to leave for Cancun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Public Persona and Investigation
After news of Travis's death broke, [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] called the police to offer help with the investigation and agreed to provide a DNA sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Over the following month, forensics recovered the deleted photos from Travis's camera and found [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi's]] DNA at the crime scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Unaware of the accumulating evidence, [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] posted multiple pictures of herself and Travis on Facebook with emotional messages and sent his family flowers and a letter expressing grief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Interrogations and Trial Narratives
During her [[interrogation_and_trial_of_jodi_arias|interrogation]], Detective Esteban Flores noted [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi's]] peculiar behavior, including feigning sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. She was attempting to project a "soft-spoken, sweet-natured, god-fearing individual" persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. When confronted with evidence, she continuously denied being at Travis's house on the day of the murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

She offered various elaborate stories, including a false alibi about her road trip and a fantastical tale of two masked assailants who murdered Travis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>. In this version, she claimed to have tried to save Travis from a female attacker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>, but was forced to leave under threat to her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>. She also claimed she didn't call the police to protect Travis's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>.

### Defense Strategies
During the [[interrogation_and_trial_of_jodi_arias|trial]], which began on January 2, 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:45">[02:28:45]</a>, [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi's]] defense team presented a new narrative. They argued that [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] "did not always tell the truth" due to fear and panic, having no prior experience with police interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:20">[02:29:20]</a>. Their strategy was to portray [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] as a "naive victim" and Travis as the "calculated villain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:02">[02:32:02]</a>.

They claimed Travis was a sexually overbearing domestic abuser and a "deep-seated pedophile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:30">[02:36:30]</a>. [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] testified she caught him looking at images of children and that he even asked her to wear Spider-Man underwear during sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. She explained she stayed with him because she believed he felt "more normal" sleeping with a woman instead of fantasizing about a child, hoping he would change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:08">[02:37:08]</a>.

Her final account of the killing was self-defense: after she accidentally dropped his camera, Travis "lunged at [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi]] in anger," body-slamming her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:40">[02:39:40]</a>. She then ran to the closet, grabbed a gun she had previously found, and when Travis lunged at her again, the gun "went off" accidentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:56">[02:39:56]</a>. She claimed to have "no clear memories" after Travis screamed, "I'll kill you," suggesting "mortal terror" caused memory loss for the stabbings and throat cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:05">[02:40:05]</a>.

### Prosecution's Counter-Arguments
The prosecution refuted these claims, asserting that [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi's]] various stories were "manipulative lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>. They highlighted the absurdity of her self-defense story given the short 62-second time frame between accidental photographs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:16">[01:51:16]</a>, arguing it was impossible for her to get body-slammed, run to the closet, retrieve a gun, shoot Travis, then find a knife, and stab him 27 times and cut his throat in that short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:50">[01:56:50]</a>. They argued the stab wound to the heart likely occurred when Travis was in a defenseless sitting position, implying premeditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>.

The prosecution emphasized the lack of evidence for Travis's alleged pedophilia or abusive behavior, noting that [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi's]] journal and text messages did not support these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:40">[02:02:40]</a>. They also pointed out the inconsistency of someone who truly cared about children not reporting such allegations to the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>.

## Outcome
The jury found [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi Ann Arias]] guilty of first-degree murder, with seven jurors finding both premeditated and felony murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:16">[02:31:16]</a>. She was sentenced to incarceration in the Department of Corrections for the rest of her natural life with no possibility of parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:31">[02:34:31]</a>. To this day, [[jodi_arias_early_life|Jodi Arias]] maintains her innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:42">[02:34:42]</a>.# Relationship between Jodi Arias and Travis Alexander

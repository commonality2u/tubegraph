## Initial Meeting and Development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
[[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi Ann Arias]] was born on July 9, 1980, in Salinas, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. In February 2006, at 26 years old, she started a job as a salesperson for Pre-Paid Legal, a network marketing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Through this work, she met Travis Alexander, a 28-year-old practicing Mormon from Arizona who also worked part-time as a motivational speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Travis was described as a very charismatic young man, which immediately captured Jodi's attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. They first met at a business conference in September 2006, initiating a "curious relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Dysfunctional Dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
[[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] was in love with Travis, but he was not in love with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. They broke up after just five months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Soon after the split, [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] moved from her grandparents' home in Yreka, California, to an apartment just two blocks from Travis's house in Mesa, Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. At that moment, Travis's friends labeled her the "crazy stalker ex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Travis agreed with this assessment, but he continued having sex with her for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

[[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] would frequently show up unannounced, sometimes in the middle of the night, and Travis would let her in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This became a dysfunctional routine neither of them were happy with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Travis wanted her out of his life, despite enjoying the sex, while [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] desperately desired a serious relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Her diary entries indicated her firm belief that they were "meant to be together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Travis was looking to settle down, become a husband and father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:02">[02:00:02]</a>. He felt the relationship was unhealthy but couldn't stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] conceded that she also didn't think the relationship was healthy, at least spiritually and emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>. She mentioned that Travis had "proposed" many times, but wasn't serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>.

## Cancun Trip as a Catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
In late May 2008, [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] had a change of heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Travis had a work retreat planned for Cancun, Mexico, on July 10, paid for by his employer, which allowed him to bring a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] hoped she would be invited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, in the last week of May, it became known that Travis was taking another woman, Mimi Hall, a Mormon girl he had been romantically interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
> [!INFO] Mimi Hall's Role
> When [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] found out, it's assumed she was heartbroken and enraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The collective opinion was that this knowledge forged a psychological justification for a "certain decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. During her [[interrogation_and_trial_of_jodi_arias | interrogation]], [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] claimed she only found out about Mimi Hall at Travis's memorial service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:40">[02:38:40]</a>.

## Travis Alexander's Murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
On June 4, 2008, six days before Travis was set to leave for Mexico, [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] once more showed up unannounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. They had sex and took explicit pictures of each other with Travis's new camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Around 5 p.m., Travis entered the shower, and [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] began taking pictures of him with the same camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Moments after one such picture, [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] stabbed Travis 27 times, cut his throat, and shot him in the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Travis's camera took two accidental photographs during the attack, one when it was dropped and another when it was kicked, showing [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]]'s foot near Travis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The time between these two photos was 62 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Travis's body was discovered five days later by Mimi and her friends, the day before they were to leave for Cancun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Blood was found everywhere, leading Mimi to call the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Post-Murder Behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
After the murder, [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] spent an estimated 45 minutes cleaning the crime scene, wiping down Travis's body and deleting photos from his camera before putting it in the washing machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. She then drove into the desert and left Travis a voicemail to create an alibi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The next day, she called the police offering to help with the investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Over the following month, forensics recovered the deleted photos and found [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]]'s DNA at the crime scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

During this time, [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] posted multiple pictures of herself and Travis on Facebook with emotional messages, and sent his family flowers and a letter expressing grief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The Mesa Police Department launched their case against [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] on July 15, 41 days after the murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Trial Narratives Regarding the Relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>
During her [[interrogation_and_trial_of_jodi_arias | trial]], [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]]'s defense team altered her narrative multiple times.
The defense presented Travis as a "sexual deviant, a domestic abuser, and a pedophile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. They claimed Travis was violent, prone to sudden rages, and that [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] was terrified of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. They argued that [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] stayed in the relationship to help Travis overcome his "pedophilic urges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>. Her final explanation for the killing was self-defense, claiming Travis lunged at her in anger after she accidentally dropped his camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:24">[01:31:24]</a>.

The prosecution countered by portraying Travis as a "good man" and a "blessing" in [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]]'s life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:52">[01:32:52]</a>. They argued the murder was a "well-orchestrated kill," noting Travis was in a defenseless sitting position when the attack began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. They disputed [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]]'s claims of Travis's pedophilia, citing her journal and text messages, and questioning why she never reported it to the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:41">[02:02:41]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>
> [!WARNING] Prosecution's Argument
> The prosecutor stated that [[jodi_ariass_early_life_and_background | Jodi]] used lies to manipulate the narrative, and that she was a "manipulative individual" who would "stop at nothing" and "lie at every turn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

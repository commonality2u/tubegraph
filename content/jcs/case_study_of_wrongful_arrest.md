## Hindsight Bias in Interrogation Analysis

When evaluating information during interrogation analysis, hindsight provides a considerable advantage, especially when the subject's guilt is already known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The knowledge of an outcome highlights crucial elements while stripping away non-essentials, allowing for calculations that might otherwise be overlooked due to doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

The aphorism "hindsight is 20/20" applies to interrogation analysis, and it is more compatible with innocent subjects than guilty ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This is because the information to scrutinize is reduced when dealing with innocent individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Without misdirection and trickery, innocent behavior is relatively straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. While individuals are unique and trauma can cause atypical behavior, atypical and guilty behaviors are generally distinguishable with ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Case Study 1: Michael Dixon

### Arrest and Initial Interrogation

Michael Dixon, a 37-year-old self-professed introvert described as popular, friendly, but unassuming and reserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, was wrongfully arrested on August 15, 2003, in Hamilton, Ontario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Police responded to a report of a man breaking into a jewelry store and chased a perpetrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Michael, who was getting off a bus nearby after work, was the first person police saw coming out of an alley and was arrested at gunpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He voiced his innocence but did not resist, stating he would help in any way he could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The arrest was a misstep, as the 9-1-1 call described the suspect as a small white man, whereas Dixon is 6'3" and not white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This suggests the detective either forgot to review the dispatch call or rejected it as evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Michael was informed the room was being recorded and read his [[rights_of_the_accused | rights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. He asserted his willingness to speak and help with the [[crime_details_and_investigation | investigation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Detective's Strategy and Michael's Composure

The detective immediately stated that Dixon's innocence or guilt was "not an issue" as the evidence was "conclusive and overwhelming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The detective said he was only trying to ascertain "what kind of guy" Michael was, whether a "serial burglar" or if this was a "one-off thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Michael maintained a forward-leaning posture and direct eye contact, displaying self-confidence and poise, while the detective appeared nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This behavior, known as a non-verbal challenge in forensic psychology, asserted dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Michael calmly stated he didn't do it and offered to answer questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

The detective implied video evidence of Michael's guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Michael expressed disbelief, stating, "that doesn't make sense to me because if I'm on the video camera... there's no way I can be on the video camera" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. He then stated he would need a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Wrongful Imprisonment
> Michael realized he would not be going home after the interview, experiencing fear as the detective confirmed he would be charged and go to court in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

Michael continued to profess his innocence calmly for seven more minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. He was asked to draw a map and specify his movements before the arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Every detail of his alibi was later proven 100% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### Exoneration and Aftermath

Despite the detective's assurance to investigate Michael's story thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, Michael was held in jail for three and a half days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. A separate investigator later looked into his alibi witnesses and checked surveillance, leading to his immediate exoneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. A civil trial followed, and Michael was awarded $46,000 in punitive damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. The interrogating officer and three other investigators were demoted and suspended without pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

## Case Study 2: Justin

### False Accusation and Interrogation

Justin, a 26-year-old, was falsely accused of breaking and entering, first-degree theft, and assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. He was arrested at home and read his [[rights_of_the_accused | rights]] on the way to the police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. He was unaware he would be wrongfully imprisoned for over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

Initially, Justin viewed the interrogators as an inconvenience rather than a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. His responses were short, concise, and he did not seek approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

The detective's [[crime_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | interrogation strategy]] was to reveal the charges periodically, believing it easier to gain a confession to one charge at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The plan was to reveal the break-in and robbery charge first, then the assault charge later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The detective stated that the accuser, "Candy," claimed she saw Justin loitering and then breaking in to steal items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. She also supposedly picked him out of a 12-picture lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### Justin's Defensive Reaction

Upon learning of the burglary charge, which carried a possible 20-year prison sentence due to his previous convictions, Justin began to forcefully assert his innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. He became combative, stating, "I didn't break in her house. I don't know who she is" and "I was not there! I don't know this girl Candy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. He mentioned "Tim Stall," the accuser's ex-boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

When accused of assaulting the victim during the robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, Justin became very angry, yelling and cursing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. He suggested questioning Tim Stall about the injuries, believing Tim had done something to Candy and they were trying to blame him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

> [!INFO] Innocent Subject Behavior
> This aggressive but defensive form of anger is a common response from innocent subjects being directly accused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Justin's conduct was justified given the circumstances of facing significant prison time for something he didn't do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

Having already served three years for a past robbery, Justin likely understood the gravity of the situation and the investigator's tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### Exoneration

The accuser's testimony was later discredited in court, as she was caught lying multiple times on the stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Justin was exonerated, proven innocent "beyond all reasonable doubt, but essentially beyond all doubt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Comparing Reactions to False Accusations

The cases of Michael Dixon and Justin provide contrasting reactions to being wrongfully accused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Michael Dixon maintained an "incredibly tolerant" and forgiving composure, which was noted as unusual for an innocent subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. In contrast, Justin reacted with significant anger and combative defensiveness, which is described as a more commonplace response from innocent individuals directly accused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Both cases highlight aspects of [[factors_leading_to_false_accusations | factors leading to false accusations]] and the importance of thorough investigation.

Jodi Ann Arias was born on Wednesday, July 9, 1980, at 11:54 p.m. in Salinas, California. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08"></a> Despite later claims by her [[psychological_and_legal_strategies_in_jodi_ariass_defense | defense team]], there is virtually nothing known about her childhood that can be linked as a contributing factor to her later actions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39"></a>

The only notable aspect of her early life mentioned is that she dropped out of high school in the 11th grade to pursue a career in photography, which ultimately "went nowhere." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49"></a>

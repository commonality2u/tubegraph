During an interrogation concerning the disappearance of his family, Chris Watts was subjected to various psychological techniques and a polygraph examination.

## Initial Interrogation Techniques

Early in the interview, Chris was asked what is known as a "behavior-provoking question" by the interrogator: "When we find the guy who took him, what do you think we should do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. An innocent person would typically give a "draconian response," while a deceptive individual might offer an "equivocating response," fragmenting and diverting from the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Chris's answers were somewhat evasive, initially saying "they're going to come home safe correct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, and later suggesting "life in prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, then expressing uncertainty about the death penalty in Colorado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The interrogator also inquired about Chris's marriage and potential infidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Chris denied cheating, stating, "I have never cheated on my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> and "fully suspect she has never done that to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, the interrogator was already aware that Chris was having an affair with a woman named Nicole Kessinger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Chris had provided his phone earlier, believing it was to search mutual contacts for suspects, and likely deleted his correspondence with Kessinger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Unbeknownst to him, the FBI possesses programs capable of recovering deleted digital exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The interrogator continued to pressure Chris, highlighting discrepancies in his story and the police's suspicions:
> "Nothing you've told me tonight makes sense, nothing you've told me tonight feels like the truth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
> "When you walk out of this room, there's nothing I can say to a room full of police officers that's going to convince them that you have nothing to do with this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>

Before ending the initial interview, the interrogator aimed to amplify Chris's anxiety for the upcoming polygraph test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. He predicted Chris's racing thoughts that night and encouraged him to call if certain thoughts arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## The Polygraph Examination

The polygrapher began the session by using what is described as "psychological pressure disguised as reassurance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This technique is often used when a suspect's guilt is nearly conclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The polygrapher stated that she has the best training and would use validated testing methods to determine if Chris had nothing to do with the disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Polygraph Test Procedure and Psychology

The polygrapher explained there are two ways to fail the test:
1.  Failing to follow instructions (e.g., sitting still, answering questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
2.  Choosing to lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

She emphasized that it would be "really stupid" for Chris to take the polygraph if he had something to do with Shanann and the girls' disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

The polygrapher also obtains the examinee's version of the facts regarding the issues under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Chris recounted vague possibilities for his family's disappearance, expressing his hope for a phone call or for them to "just running" through the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. He spoke of missing his children and wanting them home safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

Another psychological pressure tactic, disguised as routine questioning, involved asking Chris to describe ways someone could "make someone disappear" through murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Chris listed various methods, including stabbing, shooting, hitting with a blunt object, strangulation, drowning, electrocution, or burning someone alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The polygrapher clarified that the test would ask if he "physically caused her disappearance," which includes murder or kidnapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

### Directed Lie Polygraph Explained

The test Chris took was a "directed live polygraph," where he was instructed to lie on specific questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. The directed lie test has three types of questions:
*   **Known Truth Questions:** Easy questions (e.g., "Are you sitting down?") that establish a baseline for truth-telling and disconnect thought patterns between questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **Control Questions:** Questions explicitly designed for the examinee to lie to (e.g., "Before 2018 did you ever lose your temper with someone you cared about?" with a required "no" answer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.
*   **Relevant Questions:** Questions specifically about the crime being investigated, where the examinee is expected to answer truthfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

A guilty subject shows a stronger reaction to relevant questions than to control questions, even when lying on both, due to the immediate threat of the relevant questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

### Polygraph Results

After the initial phase, the polygrapher complimented Chris for being a "really bad liar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, noting his significant reaction when he lied, which indicated he knew it was wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. This was framed as a positive sign, suggesting that if he lied about significant matters concerning his wife, the reaction would be "10 times more amplified" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

After the full test, the polygrapher revealed the results:
> "it is completely clear that you were not honest during the testing and I think you already know that. Um he did not pass the polygraph test, right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>

Chris denied lying, stating, "I didn't, I didn't lie to you on that polygraph, I promise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. However, the interrogator firmly stated, "Chris I, I'm, I'm dressed up, it's time, all right, just stop for a minute, take a deep breath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>, indicating the denial was futile.

During the investigation into the disappearance of his wife and daughters, Chris Watts underwent extensive police interrogation and a polygraph test. These sessions revealed key aspects of his behavior and the investigative strategies employed.

## Initial Interrogation and Behavioral Analysis

Investigators utilized specific [[detective_interrogation_techniques | interrogation techniques]] from the outset. One notable method was asking a "behavior-provoking question" such as, "When we find the guy who took him, what do you think we should do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> An innocent person is expected to give a "draconian response," immediately suggesting the harshest possible sentence for the crime they are falsely accused of committing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. In contrast, a deceptive individual often gives an "equivocating response," fragmenting and diverting from the question to avoid a direct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

When asked what should happen to the person who took his family, Watts first focused on them coming home safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, then suggested "life in prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. When pressed about what if his children were hurt, he equivocated, stating he wasn't sure if the death penalty was even used in Colorado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, and that if his kids were not alive, "there's nothing you could do to cope with that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Infidelity and Deception

The interrogator later introduced the topic of infidelity, stating they needed to ask about Chris's marriage and potential infidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Watts denied ever cheating on his wife and stated he fully suspected she had never done so either <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. However, the interrogator was already aware that Chris was having an affair with Nicole Kessinger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Earlier, Watts had handed over his phone, believing it was for the purpose of checking mutual contacts for suspects, but he likely deleted correspondence with Kessinger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Unbeknownst to him, the FBI has programs to recover deleted digital exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Despite being confronted with physical changes (getting fit), which the interrogator linked to cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, Watts maintained his denial of infidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The interrogator then began applying pressure, stating there was nothing he could say to police officers that would convince them he had nothing to do with the disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. He highlighted the perception of Chris not calling 9-1-1 and waking his wife up at a "ridiculous hour" to leave her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Polygraph Test Preparation

Prior to the polygraph test, the interrogator aimed to amplify Chris's anxiety, knowing a heightened state of anxiety makes it more challenging to beat a polygraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This was done through techniques like:
*   **Passive Accusation:** The officer subtly indicted Watts by praising trivial deeds, suggesting guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. For example, complimenting him on doing basic parenting tasks like getting second pairs of clothes, cooking eggs, and giving snacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Emphasizing Professionalism and Reliability:** The polygrapher assured Chris of her extensive training (10 weeks, 5 years experience, best school in the country) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> and the use of "most validated testing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> to instill confidence in the process, while subtly implying the test would expose any deception. This is a form of [[analyzing_suspect_reactions_during_polygraph_tests | psychological pressure]] disguised as reassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Outlining Failure Conditions:** She explained two ways to fail the [[polygraph in criminal investigations | polygraph]]: failing to follow instructions or choosing to lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. She then explicitly stated that it would be "really stupid" to take a polygraph if he had anything to do with the disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

The polygrapher also obtained Chris's version of the facts regarding the disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> and then proceeded to ask Watts about hypothetical ways to "make someone disappear," which was another [[police_interrogation_tactics | psychological pressure tactic]] disguised as routine questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Watts listed various methods of murder such as stabbing, shooting, blunt force, strangulation, and drowning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, as well as kidnapping, taking someone to another country, or burying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

## Polygraph Test Mechanics: Directed Lie Test

The polygraph administered was a "directed lie polygraph" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, which involves three types of questions:
1.  **Known Truth Questions:** These are easy questions (e.g., "Are you sitting down?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. They provide a baseline for truthful responses and help disconnect thought patterns between questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
2.  **Control Questions:** These are questions where the subject is instructed to purposely lie (e.g., "Before 2018 did you ever lose your temper with someone you cared about?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. They are designed so that all answers are "no," even if truthful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
3.  **Relevant Questions:** These relate specifically to the crime under investigation, and the examinee is expected to answer truthfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

A guilty subject is expected to show a much stronger reaction to the relevant questions than to the control questions, due to the immediate threat posed by the relevant questions, even though they will be lying on both types in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Polygraph Results and Confession

After the practice phase, where the polygrapher identified Watts as a "bad liar" based on his reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, the official test began. Watts was asked if he physically caused Shanann's disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a> and if he knew where Shanann was now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, to which he answered "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

Upon completion, Watts was informed that he "did not pass the polygraph test" because he was "not honest during the testing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Despite the results, Watts continued to deny lying, stating, "I didn't lie to you on that polygraph, I promise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. The polygrapher then directly stated, "It's time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>, implying it was time for Watts to confess.

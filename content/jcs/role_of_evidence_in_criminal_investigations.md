The [[Investigation and evidence gathering | collection and evaluation of evidence]] are crucial in criminal investigations, though the benefit of hindsight can significantly influence how information is interpreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. When the outcome is known, there is a tendency to exclusively seek out information that supports a subject's guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This "knowledge of outcome" highlights key elements while removing non-essentials, allowing for calculations that might otherwise be overlooked due to doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

While "hindsight is 20/20" is a well-known aphorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, it applies more readily to the innocent than the guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This is because the information needing scrutiny is reduced when dealing with innocent subjects, as the factors of misdirection and trickery are absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Although human beings are unique and trauma can cause atypical behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, atypical behavior and guilty behavior can generally be distinguished with relative ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Case Examples Illustrating Evidence Handling

### Case 1: Michael Dixon

Michael Dixon, a 37-year-old self-professed introvert, was arrested at gunpoint on August 15, 2003, in Hamilton, Ontario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Police, who had chased a jewelry store perpetrator, arrested Dixon because he was the first person they saw emerging from an alley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

During [[Interrogation techniques in criminal investigations | interrogation]], several issues regarding evidence arose:
*   **Misidentification:** The 9-1-1 call described the suspect as a "small white man," but Dixon is 6'3" and not white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The detective either failed to review or chose to reject this descriptive evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Claim of Conclusive Evidence:** The detective falsely asserted to Dixon that the evidence was "conclusive and overwhelming," stating that Dixon's innocence or guilt was "not an issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Non-existent Video Evidence:** The detective claimed to have witnesses and a "video camera" that perfectly showed Dixon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Dixon recognized this as a potential bluff, stating that if he were innocent, he could not be on video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Lack of Immediate Investigation:** Despite Dixon providing a detailed alibi, which was later proven 100% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, the initial detective did not investigate it thoroughly at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

Michael Dixon was held in jail for three and a half days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. His exoneration came only after a separate investigator reviewed his alibi witnesses and checked surveillance footage of the area in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This highlights the [[Impact of evidence and videos in criminal cases | impact of proper evidence gathering and review]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

### Case 2: Justin

Justin, 26, was falsely accused of breaking and entering, first-degree theft, and assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. He was arrested at home and not fully informed of his rights until on the way to the station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. He was wrongly imprisoned for over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

Key points regarding evidence in his case:
*   **Witness Testimony:** The detective's strategy relied on a witness named Candy, who claimed to have seen Justin loitering around her house, breaking in, and stealing items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. She also identified him in a 12-picture lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **False Accusation:** Justin repeatedly asserted his innocence, stating he was at his mother's house sleeping at the time of the alleged crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. He urged the detective to call his mother to corroborate his alibi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Discredited Witness:** The accuser's testimony was later dismantled in court, as she was caught lying multiple times on the stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

Justin was ultimately exonerated, with his innocence proven "beyond all doubt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. His case demonstrates the crucial role of verifying witness accounts and the potential for false accusations to impact an investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Consequences of Evidence Mismanagement

Both cases illustrate the significant consequences of mishandling or misrepresenting evidence. In Michael Dixon's case, the interrogating officer and three other investigators were demoted and suspended without pay due to their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This highlights the accountability within the [[Investigation process and surveillance evidence | investigation process]] when proper [[Forensic investigation techniques | evidence protocols]] are not followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

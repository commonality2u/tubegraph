When forensic health professionals evaluate stalking, four essential items are considered: the nature of the relationship between the stalker and victim, the stalker's motivations, the stalker's psychological, psychopathological, and social realities, and the victim's psychological and social vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This case study focuses on 25-year-old Stephen McDaniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Role of Technology in Forensic Investigations

The evolution of technology over the past two decades has significantly enhanced forensic investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Internet search history, in particular, can now provide insights that previously took weeks or months to uncover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Disclosure of web browser data is often a crucial piece of evidence, revealing aspects of a suspect's personality that might otherwise remain hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This can be more effective than information obtained during a full confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Stephen McDaniel's Online Behavior
A large majority of Stephen McDaniel's online time was spent watching pornography with themes of violence and torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He also conducted repeated searches on "how to commit sexual assault" and variations of "how to molest sleeping girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. To forensics, this behavior is an overt sign of desensitization to sexual activity, as excessive exposure to online pornography can build a tolerance to traditional sexual concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This desensitization led McDaniel to seek more potent stimuli, evolving from watching abstract material to planning and carrying out what he viewed online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## The Victim: Lauren Giddings

Stephen McDaniel's target was Lauren Giddings, his 24-year-old next-door neighbor of three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Victim Vulnerabilities
Lauren Giddings had no apparent social vulnerabilities; she was outgoing, popular, a well-liked community member, and had a strong social support system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, in terms of psychological vulnerabilities, "perceptual naivety" could be identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

McDaniel had asked Lauren out on a date within six months of their acquaintance, reportedly the second time they had ever spoken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Lauren declined but politely suggested they remain friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. She later confided in her friends that McDaniel made her feel uneasy and uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. In hindsight, her instincts seemed to be warning her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Lauren also told friends multiple times that she felt someone had been inside her apartment and experienced an eerie feeling when returning home alone, particularly late at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. She considered moving but never did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Unbeknownst to her, Stephen McDaniel had stolen a master key from a security guard, entered her apartment on several occasions, and filmed her movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Lauren had no proof of the danger, only a conviction that was not strong enough to prompt action when most needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## The Crime
Stephen McDaniel snuck into Lauren's apartment again while she was sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. When she awoke and panicked upon seeing him, McDaniel pounced and strangled her for approximately 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Lauren fought back, clawing at his face and chest, but was eventually overpowered and died of asphyxiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

After the murder, McDaniel dismembered Lauren's body in her bathtub using a hacksaw, cutting her into five pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. He then placed each piece in a trash bag and disposed of them in separate trash cans around campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Discovery and Investigation

Three days later, Lauren's concerned friends entered her apartment with a spare key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. McDaniel noticed from his window and invited himself in, offering to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Lauren's belongings, including her cell phone, driver's license, and passport, were still inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. A missing person's report was filed that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

The next morning, a search party commenced, and police discovered the victim's torso in a trash can next to the apartment complex at 9:40 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The rest of Lauren's remains were never recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The investigation shifted from a missing person case to a murder investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Police canvassed the area and interviewed neighbors and classmates, including Stephen McDaniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Stephen McDaniel's News Interview
Before being interviewed by police, Stephen McDaniel was interviewed by local news, unaware that part of Lauren's remains had been discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. He described Lauren as "as nice as can be," "very personable," and a "people person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. When asked if he had heard or seen anything related to the recovered body, he reacted with distress, saying, "I think I need to sit down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This reaction is interpreted as fear and shock over the discovery of evidence, disguised as sorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## The Interrogation

McDaniel was interviewed by police at 11:50 AM, offering to help but appearing fidgety and apprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Key moments included his assertion of being a virgin saving himself for marriage, and scratch marks discovered on his face and stomach, which he claimed were self-inflicted in his sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. These details made him the prime suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Police searched his apartment with his reluctant consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. They found a collection of swords, guns, stockpiled toilet rolls and provisions, and a mask made from women's underwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The most significant discovery was a pack of condoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. When questioned about the condoms, given his celibacy claim, McDaniel confessed to stealing them from another apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This provided probable cause for arrest, and his interrogation began after 11 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Interrogation Dynamics
During the interrogation, Stephen McDaniel's dialogue was monotone, and his demeanor lifeless, a change that reportedly started during the drive to the police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. His conduct was described as mystifying and almost impressive, making it one of the most extraordinary interrogation footages publicly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

When the detective tried to increase psychological pressure by closing distance and commanding eye contact, McDaniel's "absurdly haunting" gaze unnerved the detective, causing him to look away and reset his posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This rarely happens in interrogations and can boost a suspect's confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

McDaniel largely maintained a response of "I don't know" or "no" throughout the interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. When confronted about his earlier news interview where he spoke normally, he continued his "shutting down" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

After about 20 minutes of this demeanor, the detective adopted a more aggressive approach, attacking McDaniel's character by referencing his news interview and public statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This was to see if it would provoke a defensive reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. A second detective entered with a similar aggressive strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

The detectives attempted the "futility technique," implying overwhelming evidence, such as blood in his apartment, but this bluff was called since the dismemberment occurred in Lauren's apartment, not his <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. They then shifted to a sympathetic approach, trying to create a connection and offer a socially acceptable reason for the crime, like unsupportive parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. This strategy failed immediately as McDaniel denied lacking family support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

McDaniel's lifeless disposition persisted for nearly 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. The detectives repeatedly questioned his short answers and lack of conversational engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Despite being told his hair was found at the scene, McDaniel, a law student, likely understood that his prior entry into Lauren's apartment with her friends would nullify his DNA as damning evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

The interrogation concluded with the lead detective abandoning the pursuit of admission, instead attempting to belittle and humiliate McDaniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. This was likely out of frustration, with certainty of his culpability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. The detective mocked his lack of social life and denied his claims of having friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. The entire interrogation lasted over two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.

## Outcome
Stephen McDaniel's mother spoke with him soon after the interrogation, and he immediately snapped out of his "zombie-like" character, though he maintained his innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>. The reasoning behind his performance—whether pre-planned, improvised, or a psychological breakdown—remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>. However, it was effective, as interrogators gained no admissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.

Despite the lack of confession, the evidence was irrefutable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>. Hundreds of pictures of Lauren and multiple video recordings from inside her apartment were found on McDaniel's flash drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. A hacksaw marked with Lauren's blood (confirmed by DNA testing) was discovered in a supply closet in the apartment complex, and its packaging was found in McDaniel's apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

When confronted with the evidence, Stephen McDaniel took a plea deal to avoid the death penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. He received a life sentence without the possibility of parole and is currently held at Hancock State Prison in Sparta, Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

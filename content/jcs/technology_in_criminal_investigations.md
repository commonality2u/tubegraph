The evolution of technology over the past two decades has significantly enhanced the efficiency of [[forensic_investigation_techniques | forensic investigations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This progress allows for the examination of crucial components that previously would have taken weeks or even months to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Key Technological Components

### Internet Search History
Internet search history is a critical piece of [[role_of_evidence_in_criminal_investigations | evidence]] in building a criminal case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. It can reveal many aspects of a suspect's personality that might otherwise remain hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. In some instances, this data can be more effective than information obtained during a full confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

*   **Case Example: Stephen McDaniel**
    *   Stephen McDaniel's internet search history showed a significant amount of time spent watching pornography with themes of violence and torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
    *   He also conducted repeated searches on topics like "how to commit sexual assault" and variations of "how to molest sleeping girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   Forensic analysis suggests that excessive exposure to online pornography can lead to desensitization to sexual activity, building a tolerance to traditional forms of sex and potentially driving an individual to seek more potent stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. For McDaniel, this online activity reportedly escalated to planning and carrying out acts he viewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Digital Devices and Media
Digital devices, such as flash drives, can yield significant [[impact_of_evidence_and_videos_in_criminal_cases | evidence]] in criminal investigations.

*   **Case Example: Stephen McDaniel**
    *   Hundreds of pictures of the victim, Lauren Giddings, were discovered on Stephen McDaniel's flash drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.
    *   Multiple video recordings taken inside the victim's apartment were also found on his flash drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.

### Surveillance Evidence
The [[investigation_process_and_surveillance_evidence | investigation process and surveillance evidence]] can involve physical monitoring and recording.

*   **Case Example: Stephen McDaniel**
    *   Stephen McDaniel filmed Lauren Giddings as she left and returned to her apartment at various times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Forensic DNA Testing
DNA analysis plays a crucial role in linking suspects to crime scenes and identifying victims or weapons.

*   **Case Example: Stephen McDaniel**
    *   A hacksaw found in a supply closet of the apartment complex was marked with what was later identified as Lauren Giddings' blood through DNA testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.
    *   The packaging for the exact same hacksaw was found in Stephen McDaniel's apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.
    *   Detectives attempted to use the presence of Stephen's hair at the scene as evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. However, since Stephen had entered the victim's apartment after her death with her friends, this could nullify its use as damning evidence, a fact Stephen, as a law student, would likely have been aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

## Impact on Investigations
The use of technology, particularly digital forensics and DNA analysis, provides irrefutable [[role_of_evidence_in_criminal_investigations | evidence]] that can lead to confessions or plea deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. Even when interrogation techniques, such as those used in [[interrogation_techniques_in_criminal_investigations | criminal investigations]], prove ineffective against a suspect's performance, overwhelming technological [[impact_of_evidence_and_videos_in_criminal_cases | evidence]] can lead to conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.

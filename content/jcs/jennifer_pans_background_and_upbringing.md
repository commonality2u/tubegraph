The case of Jennifer Pan stands out in the true crime genre due to the extensive amount of raw footage publicly available, offering over 11 hours of material that details her entire life and provides considerable insight into her psychopathological state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Jennifer herself eventually narrated her own story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Early Life and Family
Jennifer Pan was born and raised in Markham, Ontario, alongside her older brother, in a middle-class household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Her parents, Beak and Han, were originally from Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Strict Parenting
Jennifer's parents employed a very strict, almost authoritarian, method of parenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Success and achievement were considered outright obligations for their children, whether in academics or extracurricular activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Some might argue these expectations overshadowed the children's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Aspirations and Challenges
Initially, Jennifer embraced the pressure and dedicated herself to figure skating, showing exceptional talent and at one point being expected to compete in the Winter Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, at the age of 14, she suffered a serious knee injury, ending her dreams of competing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. With her athletic path cut short, her parents' expectations now had to be met through traditional education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The challenge was that Jennifer was not as academically gifted as she was athletic, averaging a C-minus when her parents demanded straight A's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Web of Deception
Instead of communicating her struggles to her parents, Jennifer chose to meet their expectations under false pretenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This began with her faking test results, progressing to end-of-year report cards, a high school diploma, and even a university acceptance letter to study pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

In her parents' perception, Jennifer was on track for a noble and well-paid career in medical healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The reality, however, was that she was a high school dropout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, secretly living with her drug dealer boyfriend, a relationship she had maintained for almost eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Discovery and Ultimatum
Jennifer's double life was eventually discovered in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. At 24 years old, she was given an ultimatum by her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>:
*   **Option 1:** Live at home under a strict regime, cease all contact with her boyfriend, and only leave the house to pursue an education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Option 2:** Do whatever she wanted, but be disowned by her family, never return home, and have all financial support immediately cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Jennifer decided neither option was suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> and instead conceived "option number three" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. She had her boyfriend arrange a mock home invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> where three of his acquaintances would enter the Pan household, stage a robbery, and then murder her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This was planned for Monday, November 8th, at approximately 11 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Jennifer unlocked the front door, and three figures were caught on a neighbor's surveillance camera entering the home at 11:05 PM, running out just under 18 minutes later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Immediately after they left, a 9-1-1 call was received from the Pan residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

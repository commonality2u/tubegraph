## Initial Missing Persons Investigation
On April 8, 2009, at 3:25 p.m., eight-year-old Tori Stafford was last seen leaving Oliver Stevens School in Woodstock, Ontario, after retrieving her mother's butterfly earrings [00:00:03]. She never returned home [00:00:25]. Her grandmother reported her missing at 6:04 p.m., immediately triggering a missing-persons [[Investigation and evidence gathering | investigation]] [00:00:28].

Roughly seven hours later, surveillance footage from a local high school captured Tori walking alongside an unidentified woman [00:00:36]. In the video, Tori did not appear to be struggling [00:00:44]. The woman was described as 19 to 25 years old, white, 5 foot 2, about 125 pounds, with a black ponytail [00:00:47]. Local police publicly appealed for the woman to come forward, and Tori's grandparents offered a $10,000 reward for her return [00:00:55].

A Facebook group dedicated to finding Tori gained over 20,000 followers within 24 hours [00:01:03]. On April 12, a vigil was held in Woodstock, where Tori's mother made a televised appeal [00:01:10]. Over the following week, Tori's parents were interviewed by investigators and both passed polygraph tests [00:01:19]. Ground searches were called off six days after her disappearance due to a lack of clues [00:01:24]. America's Most Wanted featured Tori's case as its top story [00:01:30].

On April 17, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) took the lead in the [[Investigation and evidence gathering | investigation]], and ground searches resumed [00:01:35]. The case was officially reclassified as an abduction [00:01:41]. A media campaign was stepped up with the release and circulation of a composite sketch of the woman seen in the video [00:01:45].

## Arrests and Interrogations

### Terry Lynn McClintock's Confession
On May 19, police identified the woman in the video as 18-year-old Terry Lynn McClintock [00:01:54]. She was already in custody for breaching a probation order due to a previous drug violation [00:01:57]. McClintock was transferred to OPP Headquarters and interviewed by Detective Sergeant Jim Smith [00:02:03]. Initially, she denied involvement and claimed no knowledge of the missing girl [00:02:09]. However, approximately 45 minutes into the interrogation, she confessed [00:02:13].

McClintock provided a disturbing, detailed account of Tori Stafford's abduction and killing [00:02:55]. She stated that she lured Tori into a secluded parking space with the promise of showing her a puppy [00:02:57]. Tori was then forced into a vehicle driven by 28-year-old Michael Rafferty [00:03:03]. Rafferty drove to a secluded area about 100 miles north of Woodstock, where he sexually assaulted and murdered the eight-year-old [00:03:08]. The fatal injuries were identified as four strikes to the head with a claw hammer [00:03:16].

McClintock drew a rough sketch of the area where Tori was killed, which led police to discover Tori's remains [00:03:20]. The autopsy revealed lacerations to her liver and sixteen broken ribs, with the cause of death confirming McClintock's testimony: repeated blows to the head with a blunt object [00:03:26].

### Michael Rafferty's Interrogation
At 7:55 p.m. on the evening of McClintock's confession, Michael Rafferty was arrested and charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder [00:03:37]. He was read his rights and immediately taken to police headquarters for interrogation [00:03:44].

The interrogation was led by Staff Sergeant Chris Loam, a member of the OPP's highly trained Behavioral Sciences unit, who was the head of the analysis section overseeing criminal profiling, threat assessment, and forensic psychiatry [00:05:10]. Loam's strategy involved rapport development, maintaining a friendly and nonchalant disposition to make Rafferty more likely to cooperate and downplay the severity of the crime [00:05:20]. He claimed his purpose was to assess Rafferty's threat level, implying that the seriousness of the crime was already assessed long before any psychoanalysis [00:07:19]. His true purpose was to understand Rafferty's character and influence his reasoning [00:07:34].

Loam suggested that Rafferty's involvement was "out of character" given his lack of a prior criminal record, trying to create an empathetic connection [00:10:33]. He stressed that the evidence had led investigators to Rafferty and that Terry Lynn McClintock had provided extensive details [00:08:23]. He compared Rafferty's situation to that of Michael Briere, who abducted Holly Jones, implying that such actions often stem from underlying issues like child pornography [00:09:05]. Loam repeatedly emphasized that Rafferty's "credibility" was all he had left and that explaining his side would prevent people from "thinking the worst" [00:12:09].

After 95 minutes of psychological pressure, Rafferty remained unyielding [00:19:19]. The investigators then shifted to the "Mutt and Jeff" (good cop/bad cop) technique [00:33:25]. Another officer, Blake, became more aggressive, confronting Rafferty with McClintock's detailed confession, including specifics about the abduction, the drive to Guelph, a stop at Home Depot to buy garbage bags, and the subsequent sexual assault and murder [00:34:02]. Blake highlighted that McClintock had cried and willingly confessed without a lawyer, while Rafferty was silent [00:36:18]. He emphasized that physical evidence, such as Tori's blood and skin cells, would be found in Rafferty's car, contradicting any denials [00:37:17].

Blake emotionally lashed out, stating that Rafferty was a "cold-blooded killer" and comparing him to Paul Bernardo, a notorious Canadian serial killer [00:50:00]. He stated his personal motivation was "making you squirm" and putting Rafferty "through some of the grief that you put her through" [00:53:39].

Rafferty continuously denied his involvement, claiming, "I know that I did not do what you think I did" [00:25:40]. He also questioned the integrity of the evidence presented by McClintock [00:38:21]. Despite the sustained psychological pressure and presentation of evidence, Rafferty maintained his innocence and refused to cooperate with the interrogation [00:42:47].

## Trial and Conviction
Michael Rafferty's [[Trial and conviction for first-degree murder | trial and conviction for first-degree murder]] lasted nearly ten weeks in London, Ontario [00:55:32]. The jury deliberated for just over a day [00:56:53].

### Verdict
The jury found Michael Rafferty guilty of:
*   Murder [00:55:28]
*   Kidnapping [00:55:29]
*   Sexual Assault [00:55:30]

Upon the verdict being read, there was a collective sigh of relief from friends and family in the courtroom [00:55:43]. Lawyers from both sides appreciated the justice served and thanked the jury for their difficult work [00:56:02]. The defense acknowledged that everyone deserves a proper and effective defense, even in challenging cases [00:56:40].

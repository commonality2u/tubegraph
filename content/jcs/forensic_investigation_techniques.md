Forensic health professionals consider four essential items when evaluating stalking cases:
*   The nature of the relationship between the stalker and the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   The stalker's motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   The psychological, psychopathological, and social realities of the stalker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   The psychological and social vulnerabilities of the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Impact of Technology

The evolution of [[technology_in_criminal_investigations | technology]] over the past two decades has significantly increased the efficiency of forensic investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. What might have previously taken weeks or months can now be examined more quickly through a single component: internet search history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Internet Search History as Evidence
The disclosure of web browser data is often a crucial piece of evidence for building a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. It can unveil aspects of a suspect's personality that might otherwise remain hidden, sometimes proving more effective than a full confession in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

In the case of Stephen McDaniel, his internet search history revealed extensive viewing of violent and torture-themed pornography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He also conducted repeated searches on how to commit sexual assault and variations of "how to molest sleeping girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Forensic analysis viewed this as an overt sign of desensitization to sexual activity, where excessive exposure to online pornography built a tolerance, leading the individual to seek more potent stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For McDaniel, this online activity escalated to planning and carrying out the acts he viewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Case Study: Stephen McDaniel and Lauren Giddings

### Victim Vulnerability
Lauren Giddings, the victim, had few social vulnerabilities, being outgoing, popular, and having a strong social support system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, the term "perceptual naivety" became relevant in her psychological vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Despite declining Stephen McDaniel's date invitation and feeling uneasy around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, she didn't fully trust her instincts when she felt someone had been in her apartment or sensed an "eerie vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. She considered moving but never did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

McDaniel had stolen a master key and entered her apartment on several occasions, also filming her movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Her lack of prior experience in such a situation meant she relied on conviction rather than proof, which was not strong enough at the critical moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Investigation and Evidence Gathering
After Lauren Giddings was murdered, dismembered, and disposed of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, a missing person's report was filed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The discovery of her torso led to the investigation switching to murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Police began canvassing the area and conducting interviews with neighbors and classmates, including Stephen McDaniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

During an initial news interview, before he knew parts of the victim's remains were found, McDaniel's reaction to hearing about the discovery was described as a "genuine reaction disguised as another," likely fear and shock over evidence discovery, played off as sorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### [[interrogation_techniques | Interrogation Techniques]]
McDaniel was interviewed by police, appearing fidgety and apprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Key moments included him asserting he was a virgin saving himself for marriage, and detectives discovering scratch marks on his face and stomach, which he claimed were self-inflicted in his sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This made him the prime suspect.

A search of his apartment, which he reluctantly agreed to, revealed:
*   A collection of swords and guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   Stockpiled provisions and toilet rolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   A mask made from women's underwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   A pack of condoms, which he confessed to stealing when confronted about his celibacy claim, providing probable cause for arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

#### [[interrogation_techniques_used_in_criminal_investigation | Interrogation Strategies]]
McDaniel's [[interrogation_techniques_in_criminal_investigations | interrogation]] began with him exhibiting a "monotone dialogue and lifeless demeanor," described as an "abnormal and extremely creepy character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This unique demeanor reportedly dictated the pace of the [[detective_interrogation_techniques | interrogation]].

*   **Psychological Pressure**: A detective attempted to increase psychological pressure by closing the distance and commanding eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. However, McDaniel's "absurdly haunting manner" of turning his head unnerved the detective, causing him to look away and reset his posture, a rare occurrence in interrogations that can boost suspect confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Character Attack**: After 20 minutes of McDaniel's consistent demeanor, the detective adopted a distinctly aggressive approach, attacking McDaniel's character, particularly his public appearance on the news, to try and coax him out of his act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Collective Aggression**: A second detective entered, also employing immediate aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, suggesting rapport development was abandoned. They challenged inconsistencies, such as his claim of never having shot his three guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, and questioned his relationship with the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Psychological Battle of Attrition**: A detective attempted to maintain eye contact for a prolonged period, described as a "psychological battle of attrition" to break the suspect's "fortified barrier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. This also included moralizing, like the "cookie jar" analogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
*   **Futility Technique**: The detective employed the "futility technique," claiming blood was found in McDaniel's apartment to make him believe resistance was useless due to overwhelming evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. This bluff was called, as the dismemberment happened in Lauren's apartment, not his <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.
*   **Sympathetic Approach**: The strategy then shifted to sympathetic and understanding, attempting to create a connection and offer a socially acceptable reason for the crime (e.g., lack of family support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. This failed immediately as McDaniel rejected the premise of unsupportive parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.
*   **Non-Confrontational Questions**: The lead detective spent nearly 30 minutes asking non-confrontational questions, hoping to change McDaniel's demeanor, but his lifeless disposition persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. They also attacked his character by highlighting his perceived lack of friends and personal hygiene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
*   **Repetitive Questioning**: The detective repeatedly asked "Did you hurt that girl?" for approximately 20 minutes, possibly to induce mental exhaustion, but it had no effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Humiliation**: Towards the end, the lead detective abandoned seeking an admission and instead belittled and humiliated McDaniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. This was likely out of frustration and certainty of his culpability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. The narrator notes that [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | interrogations]] create an "ethical vacuum" where such behavior, normally considered cruel, is perceived as merited retribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. The detective also made false claims about McDaniel's family calling him "crazy" and stating nobody wanted to see him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

#### Outcome of Interrogation
The entire [[interrogation_analysis_techniques | interrogation]] lasted over two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. McDaniel maintained his "catatonic performance" and "zombie-like character" throughout, and the interrogators got "nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. His behavior was so abnormal that police were at a loss for a specific plan of attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. However, he immediately snapped out of this demeanor when his mother came to speak with him, though he still maintained innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.

### Conclusive Evidence
Despite the lack of confession during [[interrogation_strategies_and_techniques | interrogation]], the evidence was irrefutable:
*   Hundreds of pictures of Lauren and multiple video recordings from inside her apartment were found on Stephen's flash drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.
*   A hacksaw, marked with Lauren's blood (confirmed by DNA testing), was discovered in a supply closet in the apartment complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.
*   The packaging for that exact hacksaw was found in Stephen's apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.

Confronted with this evidence, Stephen McDaniel took a plea deal to avoid the death penalty and was sentenced to life without parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.

Jodi Ann Arias was born on Wednesday, July 9, 1980, at 11:54 PM in Salinas, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Her parents were initially unaware that she would become one of the most infamous individuals in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Childhood and Education

Despite later claims by her defense team, there is reportedly "virtually nothing" in Arias's childhood that can be identified as a contributing factor to her later actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The only notable event mentioned from her early life was her decision to drop out of high school in the 11th grade to pursue a career in photography, which ultimately did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Early Career and Meeting Travis Alexander

In February 2006, at the age of 26, Arias started a new job as a salesperson for a network marketing company named Pre-Paid Legal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It was through this employment that she met Travis Alexander, a 28-year-old practicing Mormon from Arizona, who also worked as a motivational speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. They initially crossed paths at a business conference in September 2006, marking the beginning of their [[relationship_between_jodi_arias_and_travis_alexander | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

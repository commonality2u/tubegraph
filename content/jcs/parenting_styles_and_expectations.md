The case of [[jennifer_pans_background_and_upbringing | Jennifer Pan]] offers considerable insight into the [[family_dynamics_and_conflict | psychological dynamics]] within her family and the profound impact of her parents' [[behavioral_patterns_and_personality_traits | behavioral patterns and personality traits]] and expectations on her life. The overabundance of raw footage, including her interrogations, provides a detailed account of her upbringing and the pressures she faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Authoritarian Parenting
Jennifer was born and raised in Markham, Ontario, with her older brother in a middle-class household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Her parents, Beak and Han, originally from Vietnam, employed a strict, "very strict" method of parenting that some might even class as authoritarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. For them, success and achievement from their children were "outright obligations," whether in academics or extracurricular activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. It could be argued that these expectations often took precedence over the children's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Impact on Jennifer's Life
Initially, Jennifer embraced the imposed pressure, dedicating herself to figure skating where she displayed exceptional talent and was at one point expected to compete in the Winter Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, a serious knee injury at age 14 ended her dreams of competing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. With her figure skating career over, her parents' expectations shifted entirely to traditional education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The challenge arose because Jennifer was not as academically gifted as she was athletic, averaging a C-minus when her parents demanded straight A's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Instead of communicating with them, she began to meet their expectations "under false pretenses," faking test results, end-of-year report cards, a high school diploma, and even a university acceptance letter to study pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

In her parents' "abstract world," Jennifer was on her way to a noble and well-paid career in medical healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. In reality, she was a high school dropout living with her drug dealer boyfriend, a secret relationship she had maintained for almost eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Discovery and Ultimatum
In 2010, Jennifer's double life was discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. At 24 years old, she was given an ultimatum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>:
*   **Option 1:** Live at home under a strict regime, cease all contact with her boyfriend, and only leave the house to go back to school and pursue an education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Option 2:** Do whatever she wanted, but be disowned from her family, never return home, and have all financial support cease immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Jennifer ultimately chose neither, instead arranging a mock home invasion with her boyfriend where three acquaintances would stage a robbery and murder her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Jennifer's Perspective During Interrogation
During her interrogation, a detective subtly shifted to discussing Jennifer's past, adopting a "therapist" role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. This approach led Jennifer to open up about her parents' expectations and the pressures she faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. She admitted to feeling guilty about lying but noted that whenever she tried to bring it up, there was "just so much expectation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

When asked about resentment towards her parents, Jennifer stated she "chose her family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>, referring to the ultimatum. She described feeling "trapped" under the strict guidelines of the ultimatum, acknowledging it "wasn't the best feeling in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. She felt there was "no choice" but to stay because "family was confused" and "family's number one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>.

Jennifer felt her parents expected too much of her, constantly comparing her to successful classmates and club mates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. They would tell her, "You could have been that person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>, which she described as "hard to take" and something she had "heard all her life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. She admitted it was "pretty tough to live up to their expectations," especially her father's desire for her to be a doctor, which she saw as "pretty high standards for anybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. She felt her parents' expectations were so high that "few people would be able to reach that expectation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.

The detective emphasized that such high expectations and the need to lie about her life caused "tremendous stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>, likening it to abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>. He noted that Jennifer, a 24-year-old woman, was being treated like a 15-year-old, unable to make her own decisions or date who she wanted due to cultural expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This external pressure, the detective suggested, led to her making a "bad decision" when it became "too much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.

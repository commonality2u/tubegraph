In modern [[investigation_and_evidence_gathering_methods | criminal investigations]], DNA evidence plays a significant role in solving cases, including those that have remained unsolved for decades, often referred to as "cold cases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. The case against Stephanie Lazarus, which went to trial 25 years after the victim's death, illustrates the application of these advanced techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Modern Investigative Techniques

Detectives in such cases utilize current forensic capabilities, including the collection and analysis of DNA. When interviewing a suspect, they may ask for a DNA swab, acknowledging that suspects are often aware of how DNA evidence is used in contemporary investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

During an interrogation, detectives may inform a suspect that it is "possible we may have some DNA at the location" where the crime occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. The purpose of requesting a DNA sample is to either identify or eliminate individuals from suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

In one instance, when asked if she would be willing to provide a DNA swab, a suspect responded, "maybe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, and indicated a need to "talk to a lawyer" due to her understanding of how such evidence works as a law enforcement professional herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This highlights the awareness among suspects regarding the implications of DNA evidence in an [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | investigation]].

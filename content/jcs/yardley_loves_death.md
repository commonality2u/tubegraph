On May 3rd, 2010, 22-year-old University of Virginia sports scholar and lacrosse player, Yardley Love, was found dead in her off-campus apartment, leading to a high-profile murder investigation and trial involving her ex-boyfriend, George Hugueley V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Background

Yardley Love was a star lacrosse player at the University of Virginia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. A photograph of her playing in the second-to-last game of the season became a symbol for the globally recognized [[One Love Foundation]] founded in her memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The last photograph taken that day captured her last embrace with her head coach, Julie Myers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

George Hugueley V, also 22 years old, was Yardley's ex-boyfriend and the first person of interest in the investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Hugueley was a fifth-generation heir to a wealthy American family with roots in the lumber industry dating back to the 1900s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. He attended Landon Prep, a prestigious all-boys private school in Bethesda, Maryland, with annual tuition fees of up to $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. He was a star lacrosse player there, becoming an All-American athlete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This led to a full scholarship at the University of Virginia, where he continued to be a key player in the starting lineup and met Yardley Love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. They dated for almost two years, in an on-again, off-again relationship characterized by mutual cheating and flared tempers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Yardley ended their relationship in 2010, just two weeks before graduation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

## Discovery and Initial Investigation

On May 3rd, 2010, at approximately 2:15 AM, Yardley's roommate returned to their off-campus apartment and found Yardley's bedroom broken into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Yardley was found unresponsive on her mattress with blood coming from her nose and severe bruising on the right side of her face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Her friend called 911, and paramedics arrived four minutes later to perform CPR, but their attempts were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Yardley was pronounced dead at 2:47 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

Criminal investigator Lisa Reeves received a call from the sheriff's office at 2:53 AM that morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. By 2:59 AM, she arrived at Yardley's apartment to lead the investigation, and by 3:50 AM, George Hugueley V was confirmed as the first person of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## [[George Hugueleys trial and interrogation | Interrogation of George Hugueley]]

Detective Lisa Reeves went to George Hugueley's home, introducing herself as a police officer but not mentioning the crime, only that she was conducting an investigation that would benefit from his presence at the Sheriff's Office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. George lethargically put on his flip-flops and got into her unmarked police car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. On the way to the police station, Lisa Reeves noticed bruising on his knuckles and cuts on his forearm, at which point he became the prime suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

### Initial Questions and Confessions

During the interrogation, George initially appeared oblivious to the gravity of the situation, seemingly unaware that Yardley had died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. He seemed to believe he was in trouble similar to being in a principal's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. Detective Reeves used a "warmth" strategy, downplaying the severity of the situation and maintaining a friendly, sympathetic tone to encourage him to talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

After being read his Miranda rights, George chose to talk, despite having the option to remain silent and seek legal counsel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

George initiated discussion about Yardley, stating he went to talk to her because she was "freaked out" about having slept with another lacrosse player from North Carolina the week before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. He confessed to breaking into her apartment, which constituted second-degree trespass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. He described Yardley becoming defensive and then aggressive, backing up against the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. George admitted to initiating physical contact, stating he tried to "choke her a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. He also said she started "hitting her head against the wall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. He admitted to grabbing and shaking her, trying to make her talk, and wrestling her on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. He maintained he never struck her face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

He then admitted to pushing his fist through her door to unlock it and enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. He claimed bruises on his hand were from a lacrosse game, not from hitting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>.

George admitted he "tossed her" onto the bed at the end of the altercation, telling her "go to bed, I'll talk to you later," before he left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>. He also admitted to taking her laptop because he was "so pissed that she wouldn't talk to me," viewing it as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>. He claimed she was bleeding from her nose but he "didn't think she was like in need of like going to the emergency room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>. A medical expert later revealed that if George or anyone else had called for help, Yardley might have survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>.

### Revelation of Death and Denial

The detectives revealed to George that Yardley was dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>. George's initial response was bewilderment and denial, repeatedly saying he didn't believe it and claiming he didn't kill her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. He specifically asked if it was due to asphyxiation, which Detective Reeves denied, confirming it was head trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:16:00">[32:16:00]</a>.

He continued to deny his involvement, saying "I didn't do it, no way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>. Eventually, George requested a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>. After his request, he was informed they would be collecting a buccal swab as part of a search warrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:14:00">[34:14:00]</a>. The application of leg irons seemed to mark a turning point, as his denial ceased from that point forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:26:00">[36:26:00]</a>.

## Trial and Verdict

George Hugueley was taken to the Regional Jail and pleaded not guilty to murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:00">[38:05:00]</a>. He was held without bond for almost two years awaiting trial, which began on February 6, 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:10:00">[38:10:00]</a>.

The prosecution argued that Hugueley went to Yardley's apartment, broke through her bedroom door, and struck her, causing the blunt force trauma that led to her death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a>. Evidence showed that Hugueley was exchanging "playful text messages" with three other women late into the night of the incident and even after the alleged attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a>.

During the trial, George Hugueley, who had been expressionless and stoic, began crying when the police interview footage was aired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>. Former UNC lacrosse player Michael Burns testified that he once heard yelling from Hugueley's apartment and found Hugueley with his arm wrapped around Yardley's neck, choking her, before she ran out crying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:23:00">[39:23:00]</a>. Medical experts universally agreed that Yardley's death was a result of blunt force trauma to the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:41:00">[39:41:00]</a>. Neighbors also testified to hearing loud noises, described as a "stereo cabinet crashing to the ground," indicating the violence of the death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>. It was also noted that Yardley was alive for two hours after the attack, suggesting that if Hugueley had called 911, her life might have been saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:00">[40:01:00]</a>.

The defense's main argument was that George Hugueley never intended to kill Yardley, asserting it was a "tragic accident" and that he deserved a lesser charge than a life sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:00">[40:11:00]</a>.

On February 21, 2012, the jury found George Hugueley V guilty of second-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:23:00">[40:23:00]</a>. They recommended a 26-year prison term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27:00">[40:27:00]</a>. Judge Edward Hogshire reduced the sentence by three years, resulting in a 23-year sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37:00">[40:37:00]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

George Hugueley was initially incarcerated at the maximum security Augusta Correctional Center for 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>. He has since been transferred to a prison Work Camp in Richmond to serve the remainder of his sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:30:00">[42:30:00]</a>. With credit for time served and good behavior, he could be released in 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:06:00">[41:06:00]</a>. He will be 45 years old upon his release, having a "second chance at life" that Yardley was not afforded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:52:00">[41:52:00]</a>. The media consensus is that while George had no intention of killing Yardley, his 23-year sentence is still appropriate, and his being drunk at the time does not lessen his culpability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:37:00">[41:37:00]</a>.

Yardley Love's family released a statement expressing relief to "put this chapter behind us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>. In response to the tragedy, the [[One Love Foundation]] was established, carrying important messages on social psychology and preventative education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:04:00">[42:04:00]</a>.

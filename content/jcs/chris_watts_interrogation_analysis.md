The interrogation of Chris Watts involved several [[interrogation_analysis_techniques | techniques]] designed to elicit a confession and analyze his behavior. These included behavior-provoking questions, psychological pressure, and a polygraph examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Behavior-Provoking Questions

One specific [[interrogation_analysis_techniques | technique]] employed was the "behavior-provoking question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. When asked, "when we find the guy who took them, what do you think we should do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, an innocent person would typically give a "draconian response," immediately suggesting the harshest possible sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. In contrast, a deceptive individual often provides an "equivocating response," fragmenting and diverting from the question to avoid answering directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Chris Watts' initial response to this question was fragmented, focusing on his children coming home safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. When pressed, he suggested "life in prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, then questioned the death penalty's legality in Colorado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Addressing Infidelity

Interrogators were already aware that Chris was cheating on his wife with Nicole Kessinger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Chris had provided his phone, believing it was to search for mutual contacts, likely deleting his correspondence with Kessinger beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, the FBI has programs capable of recovering deleted digital exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. When confronted about infidelity, Chris Watts repeatedly denied it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Interrogation Strategies and Psychological Pressure

Detectives used various [[interrogation_strategies_and_techniques | strategies]] to apply pressure and gauge [[interrogation_techniques_and_suspect_behavior | suspect behavior]].

### Amplifying Anxiety
Before the polygraph, the interrogator aimed to amplify Chris's anxiety, knowing a heightened state makes beating the test more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The interrogator warned Chris that others would also suspect him and that his thoughts would race when he went home, urging him to call if "things come to your mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Passive Accusation
The officer employed what is described as "passive accusation," where the interrogator, certain of guilt, indirectly accuses and "indignifies" the suspect through excessive praise for trivial actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. For example, praising Chris for basic parental duties like getting second pairs of clothes or cooking eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### "How to Make Someone Disappear" Questioning
During the [[chris_watts_polygraph_test | polygraph pre-test]], the polygrapher posed a series of questions disguised as routine procedure, asking Chris to describe ways one could "make someone disappear" or murder someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This was to ensure Chris understood the meaning of a key question on the polygraph: "Did you physically cause Shanann's disappearance?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## The [[chris_watts_polygraph_test | Polygraph Test]]

The [[chris_watts_polygraph_test | polygraph test]] itself involves a specific structure and set of [[interrogation_techniques | techniques]]:

### Polygrapher's Reassurance and Warnings
The polygrapher, describing herself as highly trained and experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, reassured Chris that if he was innocent, the test would prove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. She explained there were two ways to fail: failing to follow instructions or choosing to lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. She emphasized that it would be "really stupid" to take the test if he had anything to do with the disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Directed Lie Polygraph
The [[chris_watts_polygraph_test | polygraph]] administered was a "directed lie polygraph" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, which includes three types of questions:
*   **Known Truth Questions:** Simple questions like "Are you sitting down?" to establish a baseline for truth-telling and reset thought patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **Control Questions:** These begin with phrases like "Before 2018..." and are designed for the subject to purposely lie, such as "Before 2018, did you ever lose your temper with someone you cared about?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Relevant Questions:** Directly related to the crime, these questions require a truthful response from the examinee, such as "Did you physically cause Shanann's disappearance?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. A guilty subject will show a stronger reaction to relevant questions than to control questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

### Polygraph Results and Post-Test Interview
After the initial test, the polygrapher told Chris he was "a really bad liar," noting his significant physical reactions when he lied on the control questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. This was presented as a positive for the polygrapher because it indicated his body's strong response to deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

> [!INFO]
> The polygrapher stated, "in about five minutes there's gonna be two of us" who know the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Following the full [[chris_watts_polygraph_test | polygraph]], the polygrapher informed Chris and another officer, "it is completely clear that you were not honest during the testing," and that he "did not pass the polygraph test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Chris continued to deny lying on the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. This immediately led into further [[interrogation_strategies_and_suspect_confession | interrogation strategies]] aimed at eliciting a confession.

The story of two-year-old Kaylee Anthony is undoubtedly tragic, as she passed away between 1 PM and 8 PM on June 16, 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, the primary focus is often on the "disturbing and perplexing" psychological constitution of her mother, 22-year-old [[casey_anthony_psychological_profile | Casey Marie Anthony]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The exceptional nature of this case lies less in the crime's occurrences and more in the subsequent developments and [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey Anthony's behavior and public perception]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Clinical psychologists evaluated Casey during her time in custody and found no psychological abnormalities or signs of mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Initial Report and Suspicions

On July 15, 2008, Orlando police received a 911 call from Cindy Anthony, Kaylee's grandmother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Cindy reported that her granddaughter had been missing for a month, and her daughter, Casey, had finally admitted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Cindy also stated that Casey's car "smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

When the dispatcher spoke to Casey, she claimed her daughter had been missing for 31 days and that she knew who had her: "Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Casey had left the family home a month earlier, claiming a work assignment in Tampa, and told Kaylee's grandparents that Kaylee was with a nanny named "Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez" or "Zanny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

On July 15, Kaylee's grandfather, George Anthony, discovered the family car at an impound lot, which raised suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Upon picking up the vehicle, he noticed a strong odor from the trunk, which he recognized from his police officer years as comparable to human decomposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Casey was later found at her boyfriend's house, smoking marijuana and watching TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. When asked about Kaylee, she claimed she had been kidnapped 31 days prior by the supposed babysitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

During the 911 call, Casey's dialogue showed no urgency or concern, and information had to be acquired by the dispatcher through repeated questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Her mother, Cindy, was distraught, while Casey was indifferent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Interrogations and Fabrications

Casey was immediately interviewed as a witness, a tactic by detectives to lock her into as many lies as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. She provided intricate details about "Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez" and a mutual friend, "Jeffrey Michael Hopkins," claiming she met them at Nickelodeon Universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Both "Zaneda" and "Jeffrey Michael Hopkins" were proven not to exist or to have no connection to Casey as described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. She also claimed to have a co-worker named "Juliette Lewis" at Universal as an event coordinator, but "Juliette Lewis" did not exist, and Casey had not worked at Universal for over two years, where she had merely sold photos from a kiosk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

When asked why she didn't call the police sooner, Casey claimed she was "naive enough to think that I could handle this myself" and "scared that something would happen to her if I did notify the authorities or got the media involved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

Detectives confronted Casey about her lies:
> "Everything that's coming out of your mouth is a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Everything you know you give Kaylee to someone and you know you give Kaylee to someone and you don't want anyone to find out because you think you're a bad mom or something happened to Kaylee and Kaylee's buried somewhere or a trash can somewhere and you had something to do with it either way right now it's not a very pretty picture to be paying you're painting yourself as a very bad person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

Casey was eventually arrested for lying to police and other charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

### Psychology of Deception

Casey's meticulous details and eloquent, natural dialogue were textbook signs of a pathological liar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Her nonchalant tone was used to camouflage anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Her ability to continuously lie without conscience seemed to stem from her domestic history, where she often got away with misconduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. For example, she skipped the entire second half of her senior year of high school but her parents lied to family and friends about her graduating with honors, even throwing her a party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This led her to believe that her lies would always "work itself out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

When police asked her to lead them to places of interest, she led them to multiple fake addresses and then to her "supposed office" at Universal Studios, where she finally admitted she didn't work there after a 25-minute walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

### Calls from Jail

While in jail, Casey spoke to her mother, Cindy, after seeing her on the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Cindy confronted Casey, blaming her lies for her arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Casey expressed fear of her mother's reaction over seeing her daughter again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

When her parents visited her in jail, Casey appeared emotionally exhausted but still dismissed their attempts to extract information about Kaylee's whereabouts, treating their questions as "pointless and irritating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Her tears only appeared when her parents expressed care for her, not when Kaylee's photo was on her father's shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. She even attacked the character of people trying to help in the search for Kaylee, calling one a "psycho ex-wife" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

Casey continued to fabricate intricate details about the non-existent nanny "Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez" to give her lies credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. She claimed to feel a "connection" and "presence" that her daughter was still alive and "not far" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>, which was ironically true given where Kaylee's remains were later found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

### Murder Charge and Bizarre Interrogation

After spending just over a month in custody, Casey was released on bail on August 21, 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Two months later, on December 11, 2008, Kaylee's skeletal remains were discovered in a swamp less than a mile from the Anthony household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. She was found wrapped in a Winnie-the-Pooh blanket and placed in a canvas laundry bag, with duct tape around the nose and mouth area of her skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. Her death was ruled a homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

Police were granted permission to arrest [[casey_anthony_trial_and_verdict | Casey Anthony]] on a charge of first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. During a subsequent interrogation while awaiting her attorney, Casey displayed a "bizarre" and "almost comical" demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. She maintained a confident, talkative disposition, effortlessly ignoring the detectives' "passive yet glaringly obvious vibe" that they believed she was guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>. She even casually brought up the grand jury and media surrounding her murder trial as if discussing a TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.

This [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | behavior]] led to the consensus that Casey was at best a cold-hearted mother and at worst a despicable murderer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. However, it was argued that her behavior was likely "completely fake," a manifestation of her "fraudulent way of being" that became a natural behavior even in extraordinary circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. This mindset, linked to sociopathy, aims to gain advantage by lying and calculating reactions, focusing on making herself look good rather than genuine concern for her daughter's welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

## Behavior Following Disappearance

The [[the_investigation_and_trial_outcomes | investigation and trial outcomes]] revealed more about Casey's behavior after Kaylee was last seen alive:
*   On the day Kaylee was believed to have died, Casey made internet searches for "How to make chloroform" and "neck breaking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   That same evening, Casey and her boyfriend were seen at a Blockbuster video store, with Kaylee nowhere in sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   In the following weeks, Casey went out partying most nights and was photographed in a "hot body contest" just three days after Kaylee's supposed abduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.
*   Twelve days later, she got a tattoo that read "Bella Vita," an Italian motto meaning "beautiful life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.
*   A diary entry from the same period read, "I completely trust my own judgment and I knew that I made the right decision. This is the happiest that I have been in a very long time. I hope that my happiness will continue to grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.

## The Trial

The [[casey_anthony_trial_and_verdict | Casey Anthony trial and verdict]] commenced on May 24, 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>.

### Prosecution's Argument
The prosecution argued that Casey suffocated Kaylee with duct tape, placed her in a trunk for a few days, and then disposed of her body in the swamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. Their primary motive was that Kaylee's death allowed Casey to "live the good life" she desired, free from the responsibilities of motherhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>. They presented evidence such as the internet searches, the car's smell, and Casey's extensive lies, claiming only Casey had access to all the evidence related to the death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.

### Defense's Argument
The defense, led by Jose Baez, aimed to create doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. They dropped a bombshell in their opening statements, claiming Kaylee Anthony died on June 16, 2008, by drowning in the family's swimming pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. They asserted that Casey's subsequent behavior of hiding the death was due to a lifetime of "hiding her pain" and keeping "secret things" within the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Baez claimed this began when Casey was eight years old and her father "began to touch her inappropriately," teaching her to lie and "pretend as if nothing ever happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.

Baez's strategy focused on narrative control, storytelling, and creating a connection with the jury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. He argued that the prosecution purposely tried to get the jury emotionally invested to push for a guilty verdict, while subtly evoking empathy for Casey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. He emphasized that the state had the burden of proof and that if the jury had questions, the case was "not proven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.

## Verdict

On July 5, 2011, the jury delivered its verdict:
*   **Count One (First-Degree Murder):** Not Guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>
*   **Count Two (Aggravated Child Abuse):** Not Guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>
*   **Count Three (Aggravated Manslaughter of a Child):** Not Guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>

Following the verdict, Jose Baez criticized the media for "media assassination," "bias and prejudice," and "incompetent talking heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>. He stated, "Casey did not murder Kaylee. It's that simple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>.

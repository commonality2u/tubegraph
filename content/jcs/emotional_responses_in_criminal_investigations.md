During criminal investigations, particularly interrogations, the emotional responses and behavioral cues of suspects play a significant role. Detectives employ specific [[Interrogation techniques in criminal investigations | strategies]] to elicit and observe these reactions, using them as indicators of deception or truthfulness.

## Suspect Behavior During Interrogation

From the outset of an interview, detectives aim to establish a compatible tone with a suspect, negating the negative implications of the environment through a friendly disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This can influence the suspect's initial emotional state, potentially making them more at ease.

When confronted with sensitive information, such as the name of a victim, a suspect's reaction is closely monitored. For instance, a deliberate mispronunciation of a name might be used to observe the suspect's immediate response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. A prolonged pause, significantly longer than normal, can be interpreted as a sign of deception, indicating the suspect is fabricating a response rather than genuinely recalling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Psychological Reactions and Deception

In moments of intense confrontation, a suspect may experience a [[Confession and emotional response | psychological reaction known as fight or flight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The brain triggers a cocktail of hormones to prepare the individual to either confront the threat or escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Common verbal indicators observed during interrogations include:
*   **Exclamatory remarks** like "gosh," "god," or "gee," which are used to express surprise or strong emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. When used continuously, they may be an attempt by the suspect to feign a vague memory or lack of contemplation on the subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Acting naive or oblivious** to a direct confrontation. Guilty suspects often try to appear unaware to avoid the core issue, whereas truthful subjects tend to address the confrontation directly, refute it, or seek immediate clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Over-explaining** trivial details that were not even inquired about. This behavior is a clear indication of hyper-arousal and a derivative of [[Psychological profiling of criminals | Terror Management Theory]] (TMT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Suspects may go off on unrelated tangents to gain momentary relief, using detailed discussions about minor things as a brief escape from the terrifying reality they face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Psychiatrists consider this a subconscious coping mechanism, especially when a suspect is facing serious charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

A suspect's disposition and facial expressions can also signal truthfulness or deception. A passive disposition, for example, may accompany a truthful response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, while a switch to a frantic demeanor can indicate a feigned vague memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

## Suspect Confrontation and Reaction

When a suspect is directly confronted with accusations or evidence, their emotional responses can be dramatic. The verbalization of a victim's demise, particularly after many years, can cause "unmitigated terror" to emanate from the suspect's face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

The transition from a conversational tone to an accusatory one, such as implying a suspect is a suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, often leads to an immediate change in the suspect's behavior and emotional state. This can escalate to demands for legal representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, even if they are not under arrest. Expressions of shock and disbelief are common in such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

## Impact of the Crime on Victims' Families

The emotional impact of a crime extends beyond the investigation. Victims' families experience profound loss and indescribable sadness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. The effects are broad, spanning generations and creating pain for those whose lives were tragically touched by the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. The knowledge that a loved one's death occurred due to their connection to the survivor can lead to immense grief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

On February 24, 2020, 42-year-old Sarah Boone called 911 to report that her boyfriend, George Torres Jr., also 42, was dead in a suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. She explained to the dispatcher that they had been playing hide-and-seek the previous night, and she put him in a suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Sarah claimed she fell asleep and woke up to find him dead, stating she did not know what happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Discovery of Incriminating Videos

Sarah Boone was initially unaware that she had recorded two videos on her phone the night George Torres Jr. died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. These videos, which ultimately served as crucial evidence, contradicted her claims of an accidental death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

The first video, timestamped at 11:12 PM, shows Sarah laughing at George while he is zipped inside the suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. In this video, George is not laughing; he is audibly asking to be let out and repeatedly states that he cannot breathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The second video, recorded 11 minutes later, depicts the same situation, but the suitcase has been flipped over and moved to a different area of the apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Sarah's Intoxication
In both videos, Sarah Boone is described as "unmistakably and heavily intoxicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This state of intoxication may explain why she did not delete the incriminating videos from her phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Interrogation and Video Reveal

During the [[sarah_boones_interrogation_and_inconsistencies | police interrogation]], Sarah initially maintained her story, stating that she and George were having a good time, drinking a bottle of wine, doing a puzzle, and decided to play hide-and-seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. She claimed George willingly got into the suitcase, and she zipped it up jokingly before falling asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

The interrogator then introduced the discovered video evidence, showing Sarah a picture and then playing the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. Sarah's demeanor immediately changed. Upon seeing the videos, she claimed she did not remember them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. When a video of George saying "I can't breathe" played, she responded, "I don't want to watch that please" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

### Explanations and Contradictions
As the video continued, showing George in the suitcase, Sarah admitted she flipped the suitcase over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Despite the evidence, she insisted her intention was not to leave him in there or for him to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. She attempted to explain George's pleas by stating, "that's how we are with each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

When confronted about why she didn't let him out when he begged to, Sarah struggled to respond, initially saying, "I had no idea it was going to end like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. She later claimed, "I'm blaming it on the wine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>, and that the interaction was "fooling around and being stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. She also claimed she would "never drink alcohol again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

Sarah denied intentionally causing George's death, despite being shown videos of her screaming expletives at him and flipping the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. She also made references to previous [[domestic_violence_and_murder_case | domestic violence]] incidents where George had choked her, stating the video was him feeling "what it feels like when you're choking me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

## Charges and Legal Proceedings

The overwhelming video evidence, combined with her [[sarah_boones_interrogation_and_inconsistencies | inconsistent statements]], led to Sarah Boone's arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. She was taken to Orange County Jail and charged with second-degree murder, held without bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. As of the transcript's recording, she has been in jail since late February 2020 and is working with her seventh attorney, with previous attorneys citing "irreconcilable differences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.

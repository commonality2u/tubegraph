On an unspecified date, a 911 call was placed by 42-year-old Sarah Boone, reporting that her boyfriend, 42-year-old George Torres Jr., was dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Boone informed the dispatcher that she and Torres had been playing a game of hide-and-seek the previous night, during which she "put him in a case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. She then stated she fell asleep and woke up to find him dead in the suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Boone claimed she had attempted to give him CPR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

At the time of the 911 call, Sarah Boone was unaware that she had recorded two videos on her phone the night before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The first video, recorded at 11:12 PM, showed Boone laughing while Torres was zipped inside the suitcase, with Torres repeatedly asking to be let out and stating he couldn't breathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The second video, recorded 11 minutes later, depicted the same scene, but the suitcase had been flipped over and was in a different area of the apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Boone appeared heavily intoxicated in both videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Police Arrival and Initial Statements

Upon the arrival of officers, including an officer whose temperament was noted as "perfect for the situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, they began to gather information. Boone reiterated her story: they were doing a puzzle, drinking wine, and then decided to play hide-and-seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. She claimed Torres got into the suitcase because he "thought it'd be funny," and she zipped him up as a joke, but then fell asleep upstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Boone's ex-husband, Brian, was present at the scene. He confirmed that Boone had called him over and that she needed to go outside for a drink and cigarette after he advised her to call 911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Brian also informed officers that George Torres was on parole due to domestic violence against Sarah, and that Sarah had previously bailed him out multiple times after such incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

Officers secured the scene, preventing Sarah from accessing any personal items like her cigarettes, as everything was considered evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The ex-husband was confirmed to be taking custody of Boone's nine-year-old child, who was at school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Officers then awaited the arrival of investigators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

The investigators arrived and began questioning Sarah. She again explained that Torres decided to get into the suitcase, and she zipped him up jokingly, then went upstairs and fell asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Boone expressed fear for her life, stating that Torres's family had "never liked me" and would "kill me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The detectives reassured her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Sarah was asked to stay elsewhere for the night and report to the police station the following day for further questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. She stayed with her ex-husband and arrived at the Sheriff's Office the next day at 3:51 PM with a handwritten page of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This marked the transition into a formal [[detective_interrogation_techniques|interrogation]] where the evidence from her phone, including the videos, would be presented.

On a Sunday morning, 42-year-old Sarah Boone made a distress call to 911, reporting her boyfriend, 42-year-old George Torres Jr., was dead in a suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Boone explained they were "playing last night" and she "put him in a case when we were playing" a "kind of hide and seek kind of thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. She claimed she fell asleep and woke to find him deceased, expressing confusion about what happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Torres Jr. ultimately died of suffocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Initial Police Interaction

Upon the arrival of uniform police officers, Boone reiterated her story, stating they had been drinking a bottle of wine, doing a puzzle, and then decided to play hide-and-seek, leading to George getting into the suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Her ex-husband, whom she called over, was also present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He informed officers that George was on parole for domestic violence against Sarah and that she had previously bailed him out multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

Sarah clarified that George "thought it'd be funny to be put in the suitcase," and she joked by zipping him up, intending to make him "squirm a little bit" before she fell asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. She insisted they were both laughing about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The police officer confirmed her child would be taken into the ex-husband's custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Investigation and Interrogation

Investigators arrived and began questioning Boone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. She repeated her account of George deciding to get in the suitcase, her zipping it up, laughing, and then falling asleep upstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Boone expressed fear for her life, stating George's family had "never liked me" and would "kill me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The detectives reassured her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

The following day, Boone appeared at the Sheriff's Office with a page of questions, primarily about getting her phone back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The investigator then informed her about George's autopsy results, which revealed injuries to his left shoulder, a cut near his lip, and a contusion on his neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Forensics proved these injuries occurred the night he died and were not present before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Boone attributed these to George falling off her son's bike or running into walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

The interrogator also brought up previous domestic violence calls involving Boone and George <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Boone detailed George's history of coming "at me all the time," leading her to "flee" or go to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. She discussed George's anger management classes and his supposed progress, stating he would apologize for past actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. She then described George's ex-wife as a "monster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Boone stated that zipping George into a suitcase was not something she normally did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

### The Incriminating Videos

The interrogation intensified when investigators revealed they found two videos on her phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. These [[videos_recorded_by_sarah_boone_and_their_implications | videos recorded by Sarah Boone and their implications]] were taken at 11:12 PM and 11:23 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. In the first, she is seen laughing while George is zipped in the suitcase, repeatedly stating "I can't breathe" and asking to be let out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The second video, taken 11 minutes later, shows the suitcase flipped over and in a different area, with George still inside and asking to be let out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Sarah was heavily intoxicated in these videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

When shown the videos, Sarah initially claimed she didn't remember them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. As the videos played, she reacted with distress, saying she didn't want to watch them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. The videos captured her saying, "For everything you've done to me, f**k you, stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. She identified George's voice saying "I can't breathe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

Detectives pressed her on why she flipped the suitcase if she went straight upstairs to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. She admitted to flipping it, but claimed her intention was not to leave him in there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. When confronted with George's pleas to be let out and her derisive comments, she asserted, "my intention was not to leave him in there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. She later claimed she didn't think he was "panicky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Sarah felt the police were "feeding" her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>, but she still seemed unaware of the full ramifications of the evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

The interrogation highlighted the disconnect between her verbal account and the video evidence, particularly regarding George's injuries which did not align with her story of a "good day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. She blamed the incident on the wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. The [[the_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | interrogation techniques]] used by the lead detective were noted as flawed due to visible animosity towards Sarah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Arrest

As the interrogation concluded, Sarah brought out her list of questions, asking about her son's laptop and George's wedding ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. When asked what was next, she questioned if she was "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>, stating that having to live with George's death was "punishment enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. After CSI took her DNA and fingerprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>, she was told to stand up and place her hands behind her back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

Sarah asked, "Why is this happening?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a> to which the detective replied, "Because George is dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. She then accused them of a "trick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>, reminding them they had previously said she could leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. Sarah Boone was taken to the Orange County Jail at 5:44 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. She was charged with second-degree murder and held without bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>. She has since been in jail, working with her seventh attorney, with six previous attorneys citing [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_challenges_in_sarah_boones_case | irreconcilable differences]] as their reason for withdrawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

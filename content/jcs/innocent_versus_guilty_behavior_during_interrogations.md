When analyzing interrogations, hindsight offers a significant advantage, allowing for the exclusive focus on "guilty behavior" when a subject's guilt is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This knowledge highlights essential details while stripping away non-essentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. However, the concept of "hindsight is 20/20" is notably more compatible with analyzing the innocent than the guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This is because the information to scrutinize is reduced when dealing with innocent subjects, as the "versatile factors of misdirection and trickery" are removed, leaving relatively straightforward behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

While individuals are unique and trauma can cause atypical behavior, atypical and guilty behavior are generally distinguishable with relative ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Case Study: Michael Dixon

Michael Dixon, a 37-year-old self-professed introvert described as popular, friendly, unassuming, and reserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, was arrested on August 15, 2003, in Hamilton, Ontario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Police mistook him for a jewelry store perpetrator described as a "small white man," despite Dixon being 6'3" and not white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Dixon voiced his innocence and stated he would help in any way he could, without resisting arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

During the [[Detective interrogation techniques | interrogation]], the detective stated Dixon's innocence or guilt was "not an issue" due to what he claimed was "conclusive and overwhelming" evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He focused on ascertaining "what kind of guy" Dixon was, such as whether he was a "serial burglar" or if it was a "one-off thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Michael Dixon's Demeanor

*   **Non-Verbal Challenge**: Michael maintained a forward-leaning posture with eyes in contact and at the same level as the detective, displaying self-confidence and poise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This behavior is known as a non-verbal challenge in [[Psychological dynamics in police interrogations | forensic psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. His exaggerated head movement was a way of asserting dominance, indicating he was the more confident person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Tolerance of Injustice**: Michael exhibited an incredibly tolerant demeanor over the injustice of his situation, which is described as unusual for an innocent subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Calm and Composed Assertions**: He continued to profess his innocence in a calm and composed manner for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Reasoning and Intuitiveness**: Despite being noticeably afraid when realizing he would be charged and not going home, he reacted with reasoning and intuitiveness, even questioning if the detective was bluffing about a video camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Trust in Justice**: He expressed trust in the detective's assurance to investigate his story thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

Michael's alibi, including a detailed map of his movements, was later proven 100% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. He was kept in jail for three and a half days before a separate investigator looked into his alibi and surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, leading to his immediate exoneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. He was awarded $46,000 in punitive damages, and the interrogating officer and three other investigators were demoted and suspended without pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

## Case Study: Justin

Justin, a 26-year-old, was falsely accused of breaking and entering, first-degree theft, and assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. He was unaware he was about to be wrongfully imprisoned for over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Justin's Demeanor

*   **Initial View of Interrogators**: Initially, Justin saw the interrogators as an inconvenience rather than a threat, giving short and concise responses without seeking approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Reaction to Charges**: The detective's [[Police interrogation strategies | strategy]] was to reveal charges periodically, starting with the break-in and robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Upon learning of the burglary charge, which carried a possible 20-year sentence due to prior convictions, Justin began to forcefully assert his innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. He brought forward his posture and strengthened his vocal emphasis with each assertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Aggressive but Defensive**: When later accused of assault, Justin became highly combative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This form of aggression is a common response from the innocent when directly accused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. His conduct was considered justified given the circumstance of facing significant prison time for something he didn't do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Exoneration**: Justin was exonerated when the accuser's testimony was "picked apart" in court, revealing multiple lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Comparison: Michael Dixon vs. Justin

Compared to Michael Dixon's "forgiving composure," Justin's form of aggressive, combative, yet defensive response is a more commonplace reaction for an innocent subject facing serious accusations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[0:10:09]</a>. While Michael's tolerance of injustice made him an anomaly, Justin's anger was warranted given the potential prison time for a crime he didn't commit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

The evolution of technology over the past two decades has significantly enhanced the efficiency of [[Investigation and evidence gathering methods | forensic investigations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A key component in this advancement is the internet, and more specifically, internet search history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Internet Search History as Crucial Evidence

Disclosure of web browser data is often a crucial piece of evidence for building a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It can unveil many aspects of a suspect's personality that would otherwise remain hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This type of evidence can be far more effective than other information presented in court, including details extracted during a full confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Application in Stalking Evaluations

When [[Forensic evaluation of stalking | forensic health professionals evaluate stalking]], four essential items are considered:
1.  The nature of the relationship between the stalker and victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
2.  The stalker's motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
3.  The psychological, psychopathological, and social realities of the stalker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
4.  The psychological and social vulnerabilities of the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

Internet search history can now provide insight into at least two of these items, a process that would have previously taken weeks or months for forensics to conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Case Study: Stephen McDaniel

The case of 25-year-old Stephen McDaniel illustrates the impact of internet search history. His web browser data revealed significant aspects of his personality and motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

A large majority of McDaniel's online activity involved watching pornography themed around violence and torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He also conducted repeated searches on "how to commit sexual assault" and typed several variations of the phrase "how to molest sleeping girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

> [!INFO] Psychological Analysis
> To forensics, this behavior is an overt sign of desensitization to sexual activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Excessive exposure to online pornography can build a tolerance to traditional sexual activity, leading individuals to seek more potent stimuli for the same "rush" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This [[Addiction and online behavior | online behavior]] for Stephen McDaniel evolved from watching abstract material to planning and carrying out what he viewed on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

His target was 24-year-old Lauren Giddings, his next-door neighbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Victim Vulnerabilities and Hindsight

Lauren Giddings possessed few social vulnerabilities; she was outgoing, popular, well-liked, and had a strong social support system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. However, in terms of psychological vulnerabilities, the concept of "perceptual naivety" may come to light during a [[Forensic evaluation of stalking | forensic investigation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Stephen McDaniel had asked Lauren on a date within six months of their acquaintance, which she declined, stating she wished to remain friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Lauren later confided to friends that Stephen made her feel uneasy and uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. While seemingly non-essential at the time, in [[Hindsight bias in criminal investigations | hindsight]], her instinctive senses appear to have been signaling danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Lauren had repeatedly told friends she felt someone had been inside her apartment and started getting an "eerie vibe" when returning home alone, especially late at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. She even considered moving multiple times but never did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

The reality was that Stephen McDaniel had stolen a master key from a security guard, let himself into her apartment on several occasions to look around, and began filming her movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Lauren had no concrete proof of the danger she was in, only a conviction that was unfortunately not strong enough when needed most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## The Crime and Subsequent Investigation

Stephen McDaniel snuck into Lauren's apartment while she was sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. When she awoke and panicked, he strangled her for approximately 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Lauren died of asphyxiation after a struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

After the murder, Stephen dismembered Lauren's body in the bathtub using a hacksaw, cutting her into five pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. He then placed each piece in a trash bag and disposed of them in separate trash cans around campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Three days later, Lauren's concerned friends found her belongings still inside her apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. McDaniel offered to help, having noticed their arrival from his window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. A missing person's report was filed, and a search party located the victim's torso in a trash can next to the apartment complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The rest of her remains were never recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Interrogation and Evidence

The investigation shifted to murder, and police began interviewing neighbors, including Stephen McDaniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. McDaniel was first interviewed by local news, unaware that remains had been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Upon learning of the discovery, he exhibited a reaction that appeared to be fear and shock over evidence discovery, disguised as sorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

During police questioning, McDaniel was fidgety and apprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. He claimed to be a virgin saving himself for marriage, but detectives found scratch marks on his face and stomach, which he attributed to scratching himself in his sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. He then became the prime suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

A search of his apartment revealed an unusual collection of items, including swords, guns, stockpiled provisions, and a mask made of women's underwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The most significant discovery was a pack of condoms, which contradicted his celibacy claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. He confessed to stealing them, providing probable cause for arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### The Interrogation Tactics

McDaniel's [[Interrogation techniques and analysis | interrogation]] began with a monotone voice and lifeless demeanor, a conduct that baffled investigators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. His "abnormal and extremely creepy character" dictated the pace of the interrogation, even causing a detective to break eye contact, a rare occurrence that typically boosts a suspect's confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Detectives employed various [[Criminal investigation and interrogation techniques | interrogation techniques]], including aggressive questioning, character attacks, and the "futility technique" (suggesting overwhelming evidence makes resistance useless) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. A bluffed claim about blood in his apartment, based on the assumption he dismembered the body there, was debunked as the act occurred in Lauren's apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

A shift to sympathetic and understanding tones failed as Stephen immediately shut down the attempts to create rapport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. His demeanor remained catatonic for nearly 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>. The repeated "did you hurt that girl?" question, which went on for 20 minutes, aimed to induce mental exhaustion but had no effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Frustrated, detectives resorted to belittling and humiliating him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

The entire interrogation lasted over two hours, yielding nothing from McDaniel, whose performance was deemed "remarkable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. His behavior was so abnormal that investigators were at a loss for a specific plan of attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. He snapped out of his "zombie-like character" only when his mother came to speak with him, though he maintained his innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.

### Irrefutable Physical Evidence

Despite the lack of confession from the interrogation, the evidence against Stephen McDaniel was irrefutable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>:
*   Hundreds of pictures of Lauren were found on his flash drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
*   Multiple video recordings of the inside of her apartment were discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
*   A hacksaw, marked red with Lauren's blood, was found in a supply closet of the apartment complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. This was later confirmed through [[Role of DNA evidence in solving cold cases | DNA testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
*   The packaging for the exact same hacksaw was found in Stephen's apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.

Confronted with this evidence, Stephen McDaniel took a plea deal to avoid the death penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. He received a life sentence without the possibility of parole and is currently held at Hancock State Prison in Sparta, Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

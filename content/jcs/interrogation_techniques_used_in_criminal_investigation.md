Interrogation techniques in criminal investigations involve various strategies employed by law enforcement to gather information, elicit confessions, and determine the truth surrounding a crime. These techniques often adapt to the specifics of a case and the suspect's demeanor.

## Initial Response and Information Gathering

Upon arrival at a crime scene, emergency services and initial police officers focus on assessing the situation and gathering preliminary information. In one case, a 9-1-1 call was received from Sarah Boone stating her boyfriend, George Torres Jr., was dead in a suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. Initial police interactions aimed to understand the reported circumstances, providing immediate assistance like CPR instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a> and collecting Sarah's initial account of events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

Officers also spoke with other individuals present, such as Sarah's ex-husband, who provided additional context, including details about George's parole and a history of domestic violence against Sarah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. This early information helps investigators build a broader picture.

## Transition to Formal Interrogation

Once investigators arrive, the process shifts towards a more structured [[interrogation strategies and techniques|interrogation strategy]]. In this case, detectives confirm child custody arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a> and direct the suspect to the police station for further questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

### Reading of Rights

A crucial step in a formal interrogation is the reading of Miranda rights, informing the suspect of their right to remain silent and right to an attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. This ensures that any subsequent statements can be admissible in court.

## Confrontation with Evidence

A key [[interrogation techniques and strategy|interrogation technique]] involves confronting the suspect with evidence that contradicts their narrative.

### Autopsy Findings

Investigators present information from the victim's autopsy, detailing injuries that cannot be explained by the suspect's version of events. In Sarah's case, George had injuries to his left shoulder, a cut near his lip, and a contusion on his neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. These injuries were proven to have occurred the night he died and were not present before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. Sarah offered alternative explanations, like George falling off a bike or running into a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>, which were then challenged by the forensic findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

### Video Evidence

Perhaps the most impactful technique in this case was the use of video evidence recovered from the suspect's phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>. These videos showed Sarah laughing at George while he was zipped in the suitcase, repeatedly stating he couldn't breathe, contradicting her claims of an accidental death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. The videos also showed the suitcase being moved and flipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

Confronting Sarah with these videos led to a significant shift in her demeanor and narrative:
*   **Initial denial**: She claimed no memory of making the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional reaction**: She became distressed, stating she didn't want to watch them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>.
*   **Shifting explanations**: After initial denial, she tried to explain the content, claiming her intention was "not to leave him in there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>.
*   **Challenging inconsistencies**: Detectives highlighted how her memory became "impeccable" only when it suited her narrative, noting her selective recollection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>.
*   **Direct questioning**: Detectives pressed her on why she didn't let him out when he was begging, despite her claims it was a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:45:00">[25:45:00]</a>.

## Psychological Dynamics and Challenges

The [[interrogation techniques and suspect behavior|interrogation]] highlights complex psychological dynamics:

*   **Suspect's defensiveness**: Sarah repeatedly denied malicious intent, blaming the wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:00">[28:44:00]</a> and claiming it was a "joking matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>.
*   **Perceived manipulation**: Sarah expressed feeling that the detectives were "trying to like feed me" lines, recognizing their investigative approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>.
*   **Interrogator bias**: The narrator notes that the lead interrogator's personal dislike for Sarah impacted the process, causing them to abandon typical encouragement and understanding, making it a "significantly flawed yet remarkably entertaining process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. This can deviate from standard [[interrogation techniques in criminal investigations|interrogation techniques]].
*   **Direct accusations**: The detective directly asked Sarah, "you realize you're the person that killed him, right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>.

### Realization of Ramifications

Towards the end of the interrogation, Sarah presented a list of questions, focused on practical matters like retrieving her phone or George's belongings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:43:00">[31:43:00]</a>. This showed a lack of full awareness of her precarious legal situation. The investigators then took her DNA and fingerprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:00">[33:34:00]</a>. The final declaration and subsequent arrest for second-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a> led to her full realization, expressed by her question, "So this was a trick?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:08:00">[35:08:00]</a>. She was held without bond in late February 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:07:00">[36:07:00]</a>.

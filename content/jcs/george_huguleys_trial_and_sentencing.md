George Huguley V, a 22-year-old former lacrosse player at the University of Virginia and heir to a wealthy American family, was arrested and charged in connection with the death of his ex-girlfriend, Yardley Love [03:13:00]. This article details the [[legal_proceedings_and_trial_outcomes | legal proceedings and trial outcomes]] that led to his [[legal_outcomes_and_sentencing | sentencing]].

## Pre-Trial Period

Following his police interrogation, Huguley was taken to the Regional Jail [03:07:05] and subsequently held without bond for nearly two years while awaiting trial [03:08:08]. During this period, he pleaded not guilty to murder [03:08:10].

## The Trial Commences

The trial began on February 6, 2012 [03:13:16]. Huguley's appearance in court contrasted sharply with his demeanor in the days immediately following his arrest; he appeared pale, frail, and gaunt [03:28:27]. Throughout much of the trial, he remained stoic and expressionless at the defense table [03:59:58].

### Prosecution's Case

The prosecution argued that on the night of Yardley Love's death, Huguley went to her off-campus apartment, broke through her bedroom door, and inflicted blunt force trauma that led to her death [03:36:00]. Evidence also revealed that Huguley had been exchanging "playful text messages" with three other women late into the night, even after the alleged attack [03:47:00].

### Key Testimonies and Evidence

During the trial, several significant testimonies and pieces of evidence were presented:
*   **Police Interview Video:** When the police interview video was aired in court, Huguley's stoic composure broke. He began crying, pinching the bridge of his nose, and looking down as he listened to his own "hysterical voice" from the interrogation [03:03:00].
*   **Michael Burns' Testimony:** Former UNC lacrosse player Michael Burns testified that on a previous visit to UVA, he heard yelling for help from Huguley's apartment. He opened the door to find Huguley with his arm wrapped around Yardley Love's neck, choking her. Huguley then released her, and she ran out of the room crying [03:22:00].
*   **Medical Experts:** A variety of medical experts unanimously agreed that Love's death was a result of blunt force trauma to the head [03:42:00]. One medical expert stated that if Huguley or anyone else had called for help after the brutal beating, Yardley Love might have survived [03:52:00].
*   **Neighbor Testimony:** Distressing witness testimony from Yardley Love's neighbors indicated that the noise from the incident was so loud it sounded like a "stereo crashing to the ground" [03:50:00]. The jury was aware that she was alive for two hours before she died, suggesting a potential opportunity for intervention [04:01:00].

### Defense's Argument

The defense contended that George Huguley never intended to kill Yardley, portraying the incident as a tragic accident [04:11:00]. They argued that he did not deserve a life sentence but a lesser charge and a second chance [04:18:00].

## Verdict and Sentencing

The jury found George Huguley guilty of second-degree murder [04:23:00] and recommended a 26-year prison term [04:27:00]. Judge Edward Hogshire later trimmed the sentence by three years, changing it from 26 to 23 years [04:37:00]. Despite the severity of the crime, the defense believed that Huguley was convicted of a crime "inconsistent with the facts" and received a "penalty inconsistent with what the evidence would require" [04:54:00].

> The judge's decision to slightly reduce the sentence, though surprising given the circumstances, led to a final term of 23 years [04:39:00].

## Post-Sentencing

With credit for time served in jail and potential time off for good behavior, Huguley could be released in 18 years [04:06:00]. He was initially incarcerated at the maximum-security Augusta Correctional Center for 10 years before being transferred to a prison Work Camp in Richmond, where he is expected to serve the remainder of his sentence [04:25:00].

The general consensus in the media is that while Huguley likely had no intention of killing [[Yardley Love and George Huguleys relationship history | Yardley Love]], his 23-year sentence is still appropriate, if not lenient. His state of intoxication at the time of the murder is not considered an excuse or a factor that lessens his culpability [04:37:00]. He is expected to be released at the age of 45, affording him a second chance at life that Yardley Love was tragically denied [04:52:00].

### Family Statement

Yardley Love's family released a statement expressing that they found "no joy in other sorrow" but were "relieved to put this chapter behind us" [04:15:00].

## Legacy

A non-profit organization called the One Love Foundation was established in Yardley Love's memory [02:09:00]. This foundation carries crucial messages on social psychology and preventative education [04:04:00].

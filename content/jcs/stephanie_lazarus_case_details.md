The case against Stephanie Lazarus involved detectives employing a ruse to bring her in for questioning. They invited her to advise them on a case involving stolen art [00:00:00]. This unusual approach was adopted because they were dealing with a fellow law enforcement officer [00:00:06], requiring extensive rehearsal and preparation for the interview [00:00:08].

## Interrogation Strategy

Detectives aimed to keep the conversation as casual as possible for an extended period, waiting for key moments to initiate confrontation [00:00:11]. Upon Stephanie's arrival, they immediately set a compatible tone [00:00:39], negating the negative implications of being in an interrogation room through a friendly disposition [00:00:45].

The stated reason for the meeting location was to prevent the spread of rumors or innuendo within the workplace [00:01:02]. However, the actual reason was to ensure Stephanie would check in her firearm without suspicion, as all firearms must be checked before entering the area [00:01:05].

## Initial Confrontation and Stephanie's Reaction

Detectives introduced the name of John Ruetten, Stephanie's former boyfriend, noting his name had been mentioned in their case notes [00:01:23]. They deliberately mispronounced his name as a strategy to observe her reaction [00:01:53].

Stephanie exhibited a prolonged pause, which a psychiatrist later noted was four times longer than it should have been [00:02:04]. She attempted to be deceptive, acting as if she hadn't thought about the name in a long time, despite it likely being ingrained in her memory [00:02:08].

When asked about John, she initially stated she met him in the dorms [00:02:42] and that they were "very close friends" [00:02:58]. She omitted the fact that they had dated for four years and gone on numerous holidays [00:02:44]. When pressed, she eventually admitted they had dated [00:03:31].

## Introduction of the Victim

The detectives then revealed the case involved John's wife, Sherry Rasmussen [00:03:37]. This revelation triggered a psychological "fight or flight" reaction in Stephanie, and she chose to "fight" by maintaining her denial [00:03:47].

Stephanie claimed she didn't "really" know Sherry [00:04:03]. She frequently used exclamatory remarks like "gosh" and "god" to suggest a vague memory, implying she had no reason to dwell on John or his wife since their relationship ended over two decades prior [00:04:23], [00:04:35].

## Evasive Tactics and Red Flags

As the conversation continued, Stephanie, an experienced police officer herself [00:05:04], was aware that acting oblivious to the situation would be a red flag. She initially challenged the detectives about the change in topic from art theft to John Ruetten [00:05:31]. The detective subtly avoided her direct question by offering a deceptively reassuring response, focusing on workplace rumors and the need for privacy, essentially trying to maintain the false perception that they were on her side [00:05:47]. Stephanie eventually warily accepted this reassurance without further inquiry [00:06:48].

She continued to claim a "foggy memory" regarding incriminating details, stating it had been "a million years ago" [00:07:00]. She also began to over-explain trivial matters, a clear indication of hyper-arousal and a coping mechanism known as Terror Management Theory, where suspects go on unrelated tangents to gain momentary relief [00:07:30], [00:07:40].

When asked if there was ever anything "uncomfortable" between her and Sherry Rasmussen, Stephanie again feigned ignorance, claiming she couldn't remember if they had ever had a conversation [00:15:18]. However, eight separate witnesses testified that Stephanie had confronted Sherry at the hospital where Sherry worked. This confrontation was described as highly aggressive, with Stephanie being the more combative and even making threats against Sherry's life, leading to Stephanie being escorted off the premises by security [00:14:52].

## Admission of Knowledge

When asked if she knew what happened to John's wife, Stephanie responded, "Yeah, I know she got killed" [00:13:38]. At this moment, the transcript notes "unmitigated terror emanating from the suspect's face" as she verbalized the victim's tragic demise for the first time in likely over two decades [00:13:42]. She claimed she heard about it from a poster at work or from a friend [00:13:57], [00:14:08].

## Request for DNA and Rights

As the pressure mounted, Stephanie became agitated, stating, "If you guys are claiming that I'm a suspect then you know I I got a problem with you know with that" [00:17:31]. She asked, "Do I need to get a lawyer if you're accusing me of me" [00:17:58].

When detectives asked if she would be willing to provide a DNA swab, she hesitated, saying "Maybe, because now now now because now I'm thinking I probably need to talk to a lawyer" [00:19:07]. She stated she understood how the process works as she had "been doing this a long time" [00:19:22]. She felt the detectives were "trying to pin something on me" [00:19:39].

The detectives explained their job was to "identify and eliminate" suspects [00:19:44] and that her name was "in the book" with people pointing to her [00:20:16]. Stephanie acknowledged they had to do their job but stated she would contact someone [00:20:30].

## Miranda Warning and Verdict

Eventually, Stephanie was read her Miranda rights:
*   Right to remain silent [00:21:53]
*   Anything said can be used against her [00:21:56]
*   Right to an attorney [00:22:00]
*   Right to a court-appointed attorney if she cannot afford one [00:22:04]

When asked if she wanted to talk to them right now, Stephanie replied, "No" [00:22:10]. She expressed shock, stating, "This is absolutely crazy" [00:21:32], "I'm like I'm like in shock I'm totally in shock" [00:22:17].

The jury later announced their verdict in the case of People of the State of California versus Stephanie Eileen Lazarus (case number BA 357-423) [00:22:33]. The jury found Stephanie Eileen Lazarus guilty of the crime of murder of Sherry Rasmussen, specifying the murder was of the first degree [00:22:48].

John Ruetten delivered a victim impact statement, describing the profound loss of Sherry and the "bizarre world of disbelief and indescribable sadness" the families had been thrust into [00:23:16]. He emphasized Sherry's extraordinary qualities and the pain caused by her death [00:24:03]. He stated that the fact "Sherry's death occurred because she met and married me brings me to my knees" [00:24:39].

Stephanie Lazarus was sentenced to 27 years to life for the murder of Sherry Rasmussen [00:24:45]. She is currently held in the maximum security unit of the Central California Women's Facility [00:24:50].

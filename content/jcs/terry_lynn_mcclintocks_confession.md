On April 8, 2009, eight-year-old Tori Stafford was last seen leaving Oliver Stevens School in Woodstock, Ontario, at 3:25 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> She was captured on surveillance footage walking side-by-side with an unidentified woman shortly after leaving school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The woman did not appear to be struggling, and was described as being between 19 and 25 years old, white, 5'2", approximately 125 pounds, with a black ponytail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Identification and Arrest
On May 19, police received information identifying the woman in the video as 18-year-old Terry Lynn McClintock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. She was already in custody for breaching a probation order related to a prior drug violation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:02:01]</a>.

## The Interrogation
Terry Lynn McClintock was transferred to the Ontario Police Headquarters and interviewed by Detective Sergeant Jim Smith at approximately 5:30 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Initially, she denied being the woman in the video and claimed to know nothing about the missing girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, about 45 minutes into the interrogation, she broke down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Details of the Confession
McClintock described the abduction and killing of Tori Stafford in disturbing detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. She confessed to luring Tori into a secluded parking space by promising to show her a puppy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Tori was then forced into the backseat of a vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The driver of the vehicle was identified as 28-year-old [[interrogation_of_michael_rafferty | Michael Rafferty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. [[interrogation_of_michael_rafferty | Rafferty]] then drove to a secluded area about 100 miles north of Woodstock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. McClintock stated that [[interrogation_of_michael_rafferty | Rafferty]] sexually assaulted and murdered the eight-year-old, with the fatal injuries being four strikes to the head with a claw hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

McClintock drew a rough sketch of the area where Tori was killed, which subsequently led police to discover Tori's remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Tori was found with lacerations to her liver and sixteen broken ribs, but her cause of death, repeated blows to the head with a blunt object, correlated with McClintock's testimony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Terry Lynn's Demeanor
During the interrogation, McClintock cried throughout, using two boxes of Kleenex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. She declined the offer to call a lawyer four times, stating she felt so bad about what happened that she just wanted to tell everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. The detectives noted that her emotional state and willingness to confess were significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## Consequences
At 7:55 p.m. the same evening, [[interrogation_of_michael_rafferty | Michael Rafferty]] was arrested and charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Ultimately, both [[interrogation_of_michael_rafferty | Michael Rafferty]] and Terry Lynn McClintock were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. McClintock's confession played a crucial role in the case, leading to the recovery of Tori's body and the subsequent charges against [[interrogation_of_michael_rafferty | Michael Rafferty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

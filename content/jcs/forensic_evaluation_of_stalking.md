From: [[jcs]] <br/> 

When forensic health professionals evaluate stalking, four essential items are considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:
1.  The nature of the relationship between the stalker and the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
2.  The stalker's motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
3.  The psychological, psychopathological, and social realities of the stalker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
4.  The psychological and social vulnerabilities of the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Impact of Technology on Forensic Investigations

The evolution of technology, particularly over the past two decades, has significantly increased the efficiency of [[investigation_and_evidence_gathering_methods | forensic investigations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Internet search history, in particular, can provide crucial evidence for building a case, revealing aspects of a suspect's personality that might otherwise remain hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This data can be more effective than even a full confession in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_internet_search_history_in_forensic_investigations | impact of internet search history in forensic investigations]].

### Case Study: Stephen McDaniel

The case of 25-year-old Stephen McDaniel illustrates these components through hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

#### Stalker's Profile: Stephen McDaniel

Stephen McDaniel's internet search history revealed extensive viewing of violent and torture-themed pornography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He also conducted repeated searches on "how to commit sexual assault" and variations of "how to molest sleeping girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. To forensics, this indicates an overt sign of desensitization to sexual activity, where excessive exposure to online pornography can build tolerance, leading the individual to seek more potent stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For Stephen, this online consumption escalated to planning and executing actions seen on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

#### Victim's Vulnerabilities: Lauren Giddings

Lauren Giddings, Stephen's 24-year-old next-door neighbor of three years, possessed no apparent social vulnerabilities; she was outgoing, popular, well-liked, and had a strong social support system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Regarding psychological vulnerabilities, "perceptual naivety" is a term that could apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Stephen had asked Lauren on a date within six months of their acquaintance, which she declined, politely stating she wished to remain friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Lauren later confided in friends that Stephen made her feel extremely uneasy and uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

In hindsight, her instinctive senses were trying to warn her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Lauren had repeatedly told friends she felt someone had been inside her apartment and experienced an eerie vibe when returning alone, especially late at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. She even considered moving multiple times but never did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The reality was that Stephen McDaniel had stolen a master key from a security guard and entered her apartment on several occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He also began filming her movements to and from her apartment at all hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Lauren lacked proof of the danger, only conviction, which ultimately was not strong enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### The Murder and Subsequent Discovery

Stephen McDaniel snuck into Lauren's apartment while she was sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. When she awoke and panicked, he strangled her for approximately 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Lauren fought back but was overpowered and died of asphyxiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. After the murder, Stephen dismembered her body in the bathtub using a hacksaw, cutting her into five pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. He placed the pieces in trash bags and disposed of them in separate trash cans around campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Three days later, Lauren's concerned friends, using a spare key, entered her apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. McDaniel, noticing them from his window, invited himself in and offered to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. All of Lauren's belongings, including her phone, driver's license, and passport, were still inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

A missing person's report was filed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The next morning, a search party commenced, and police discovered the victim's torso at 9:40 AM in a trash can near the apartment complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The rest of her remains were never recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The investigation transitioned from a missing person case to a murder investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Police Interview and [[investigation_tactics_and_police_interrogation | Interrogation Tactics]]

Police canvassed the area, interviewing neighbors and classmates, including Stephen McDaniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Before his police interview, he was interviewed by local news, unaware that part of the victim's remains had been discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Upon hearing about the recovery, Stephen's reaction of needing to sit down was likely a genuine display of fear and shock over evidence discovery, disguised as sorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Initial Police Encounter

Stephen was interviewed by police at 11:50 AM, offering help but appearing fidgety and apprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Key moments included his assertion of being a virgin saving himself for marriage, and the detective discovering scratch marks on his face and stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Stephen claimed these scratches were self-inflicted in his sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. He unknowingly became the prime suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

When police requested to search his apartment, Stephen reluctantly agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The search uncovered a collection of swords, guns, stockpiled provisions, toilet rolls, and a mask made of women's underwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The most significant discovery was a pack of condoms, which contradicted his celibacy claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Stephen then confessed to stealing the condoms, providing probable cause for his arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### The Interrogation

Stephen's interrogation began just after 11 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. His demeanor shifted to a monotone dialogue and lifeless disposition on the drive to the station, remaining consistent throughout the interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This unusual behavior made it "one of the most extraordinary pieces of [[interrogation_techniques_and_analysis | interrogation footage]] to ever reach the public domain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

The suspect's abnormal and "creepy" character seemed to dictate the interrogation's pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

#### [[psychological_techniques_in_suspect_interviews | Psychological Techniques]] Used by Detectives

*   **Aggressive Approach and Eye Contact**: The detective initially closed the distance and demanded eye contact, a technique to increase psychological pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. However, Stephen's unnerving gaze caused the detective to look away and reset his posture, a rare occurrence that can boost suspect confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Subtle Pressure**: The detective then retreated to trivial questions before attempting a more subtle pressure, but Stephen maintained his composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Direct Attack on Character**: After 20 minutes of Stephen's unwavering demeanor, the detective adopted a distinctly aggressive approach, attacking Stephen's character to provoke a defensive reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This also failed to elicit a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Two Detectives with Aggression**: A second detective entered, also employing immediate aggression, suggesting a collective abandonment of rapport development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The "psychological charge" of closing distance and prolonged eye contact aimed to crack Stephen's barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. This "psychological battle of attrition" can last minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
*   **Futility Technique**: The detective attempted to make Stephen believe further resistance was useless due to overwhelming evidence, stating, "There's blood in your apartment Stephen, you didn't get it all up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. However, this bluff was called, as the dismemberment occurred in Lauren's apartment, not Stephen's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.
*   **Shift to Sympathetic Approach**: The strategy then shifted to sympathetic and understanding, attempting to create a connection and offer a socially acceptable reason for the crime (e.g., unsupportive parents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. This failed, as Stephen immediately denied the concept of unsupportive parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.
*   **Non-Confrontational Questions**: For nearly 30 minutes, the lead detective asked non-confrontational questions to try and change Stephen's demeanor, but he maintained his lifeless disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.
*   **Belittling and Humiliation**: Nearing the end, the lead detective abandoned the pursuit of admission and resorted to belittling and humiliating Stephen, likely out of frustration and certainty of his guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. This included calling out his alleged lack of friends and family support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. The ethical vacuum of interrogations makes such behavior, otherwise considered cruel, appear merited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **Repetitive Questioning**: For 20 minutes, the detective repeatedly asked, "Did you hurt that girl?" to which Stephen consistently replied, "No, I didn't," seemingly trying to induce mental exhaustion, but it had no effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

#### Stephen McDaniel's Behavior

Stephen's "catatonic performance" throughout the two-hour interrogation was remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. He maintained his innocence and the zombie-like character only snapped out of it when his mother came to speak with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>. Whether his demeanor was a pre-planned strategy, improvised, or a psychological breakdown is unclear, but it evidently worked in preventing the interrogators from gaining anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. His abnormal behavior left them at a loss for a specific plan of attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

### Irrefutable Evidence and Outcome

Despite the ineffective interrogation, the evidence against Stephen was irrefutable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>:
*   Hundreds of pictures of Lauren and multiple video recordings from inside her apartment were found on Stephen's flash drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
*   A hacksaw, marked red with Lauren's blood (confirmed by DNA testing), was discovered in the apartment complex's supply closet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.
*   The packaging for that exact hacksaw was found in Stephen's apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.
*   Stephen, being a law student, would have been aware that his DNA found at the scene could be nullified as evidence, since he was present in Lauren's apartment with her friends three days after her death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

When confronted with the evidence, Stephen McDaniel took a plea deal to avoid the death penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. He was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole and is currently held at the high-security Hancock State Prison in Sparta, Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

On Friday, November 23rd, 2012, Michael Dunn, a 45-year-old software developer, was involved in an incident at a gas station in Jacksonville, Florida, which resulted in the death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>. Dunn claimed his actions were in self-defense, stemming from a perceived threat and fear for his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:05">[01:45:05]</a>.

## Background and Events Leading to the Shooting

Michael Dunn, along with his girlfriend and fiancée of six months, 45-year-old nurse Rhonda Rauer, had driven two hours from their shared home in Brevard County to Jacksonville for his son's wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:29">[02:48:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:50">[03:48:50]</a>. They had a seven-month-old French Bulldog named Charlie waiting at their hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:60">[03:51:60]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:90">[03:52:90]</a>. After the wedding reception, where Dunn consumed three or four rum and cokes, they left early to take the puppy for a walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

On their way back to the hotel, they decided to stop at a Gate gas station on Bay Meadows Road to buy a bottle of wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:10">[04:28:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. As they pulled in, a red Dodge Durango also entered the parking lot, pulling into the spot next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. The Durango belonged to 18-year-old Tommy Storms, who was inside the store buying cigarettes, while his three friends — Leland Brunson, Jordan Davis, and Tevin Thompson — remained in the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

## The Confrontation

Upon parking, Michael Dunn commented to Rhonda Rauer, "I hate that thug music," referring to the loud music coming from the Durango <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:60">[05:45:60]</a>. Rhonda then went into the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

Michael Dunn rolled down his window and asked the occupants of the Durango to turn the music down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Tevin Thompson complied and turned the music down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. However, Jordan Davis told Thompson to turn it back up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. When Tommy Storms returned to the car, Thompson informed him what had happened, and Jordan Davis directly confronted Dunn, saying, "Yeah, I'm talking to you" when Dunn asked, "Are you talking to me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. Dunn then stated, "No, you're not gonna talk to me that way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

Dunn claimed that he then saw Jordan Davis reach into the car and come up with something he believed was a shotgun, and heard him say, "You're dead, motherfucker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This prompted Dunn to retrieve his pistol from his glove compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## The Shooting Incident

Within three minutes of pulling into the gas station, Michael Dunn fired a total of 10 shots into the Dodge Durango <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. The first three shots came through the back passenger side door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. Tommy Storms immediately put the SUV in reverse and backed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. The fourth shot missed, while shots five, six, and seven came through the front passenger side door as the vehicle moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. As the SUV performed a J-turn to flee, Dunn exited his car, aimed at the retreating vehicle, and fired three more shots into the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

Jordan Davis was struck three times – in the leg, lungs, and heart – and bled to death in under 45 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. He was 17 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath

Roughly 20 seconds after the gunfire, Rhonda Rauer, realizing her fiancé had fired the shots, came out of the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Dunn urgently told her to get in the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. As they drove away, Rhonda asked what happened, and Dunn stated, "I shot at the car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. When asked why, he claimed, "They threatened to kill me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. He told her he only shot at the car and didn't hurt anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. Rhonda kept her shocked thoughts to herself, planning to discuss it in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

Upon returning to the hotel, Dunn walked their dog, ordered a pizza, and poured himself a rum and coke before they went to sleep with almost no conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

The next morning, Rhonda saw news reports of a shooting at a convenience store involving a red SUV and loud music, with one person dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. She immediately told Dunn, "We need to go home," and they drove straight back to Brevard County, listening to the radio and with minimal conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

## Interrogation

Witnesses at the scene provided Dunn's license plate number, allowing police to track him to his home in Brevard County <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. He was brought back to the JSO police department and interrogated 22 hours after the shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

Dunn initially tried to present himself as the victim, stating he "fought back" because he "refuse[d] to be a victim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. He claimed he politely asked them to turn the music down, and they did, but then it came back on, and the situation escalated with yelling and threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. He stated he heard them saying "kill him" or "kill that motherfucker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[01:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. He claimed to have seen one of them reach down and come up with what he thought was a shotgun or a stick, saying "you're dead, motherfucker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[01:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[01:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[02:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. He admitted to shooting four times initially, then four more times as the SUV fled, explaining he was still scared and thought they had a gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[01:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. He also boasted about his gun handling skills during the recounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

Detectives, employing tactics to encourage disclosure, gently pressed Dunn on inconsistencies:
*   **Failure to Report:** They questioned why he didn't call the police immediately from the hotel, especially if he was so scared, instead choosing to order pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Dunn stated he wanted to return to his hometown to report it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **No Weapon Found:** The most significant contradiction was the lack of any weapon or stick found in or near the Durango <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Dunn's description of seeing a "barrel" or "stick" was unconvincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:00">[02:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Shooting a Fleeing Vehicle:** Detectives pointed out that shooting at a vehicle backing away is no longer a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Dunn struggled to justify this, stating he thought they had a weapon and was preventing them from shooting back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[02:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **Getting Out of Car:** They highlighted the illogical action of exiting his car if he believed the occupants had a shotgun, as it would expose him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Victim's Position:** Forensics refuted Dunn's claim that Jordan Davis was getting out of the truck or that the door was open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. The bullets went through the closed door, hitting Davis inside the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[03:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **Victim's History:** Detectives emphasized that Jordan Davis and his friends had no history of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   **Rhonda Rauer's Testimony:** Four days later, Rhonda Rauer was interviewed and directly contradicted Dunn's claims, stating he never mentioned seeing a gun, weapon, stick, shotgun, barrel, or lead pipe in the SUV, either at the gas station, back at the hotel, or during the drive home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[01:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:20:00">[05:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. She also confirmed he didn't take the gun into the hotel room, despite his claim of fearing "thugs for guns" coming to the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

Dunn eventually asked if he needed a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. He was then informed he was being charged with murder and attempted murder, with no possibility of bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:47:00">[04:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

## Trial and Conviction

During the trial, Dunn's demeanor changed, showing a "considerable increase in both emphasis and conviction" in his statements, indicating his lawyer had instructed him on how to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:51:00">[04:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. He added new details not mentioned in his interrogation, such as the victim saying "this shit's going down now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. He also displayed emotional responses when talking about his fiancée and dog, which the prosecution suggested was a contrived attempt to elevate his character rather than genuine remorse for the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:56:00">[05:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

On February 15, 2014, Michael Dunn was found guilty on three counts of attempted murder, for which he received a 90-year sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:20:00">[05:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Seven months later, on October 1, he was rendered an additional life sentence without the possibility of parole for the murder of Jordan Davis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:29:00">[05:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. His appeal was denied on November 17, 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. He is currently held at the maximum-security Oregon State Penitentiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

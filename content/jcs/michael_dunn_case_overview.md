On November 23, 2012, Michael David Dunn, a 45-year-old software developer, was involved in a fatal shooting at a Jacksonville, Florida gas station. The incident resulted in the death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis and became a widely publicized case due to its circumstances and Dunn's subsequent claims of self-defense [02:48:58].

## The Incident
### Pre-Shooting Events
Michael Dunn, the father of the groom, attended a wedding at the Winterbourne Inn in Jacksonville on November 23, 2012, accompanied by his fiancée, Rhonda Rauer [02:28:44]. They had driven two hours from their home in Brevard County with their seven-month-old French Bulldog, Charlie, who was at their hotel [03:48:47]. During the reception, Dunn reportedly consumed three or four rum and cokes, while Rauer had one glass of red wine and two to three rum and cokes [04:00:58]. After about three hours at the reception, they left to walk their puppy [04:16:03].

On their way back to the hotel, they decided to stop at a Gate Gas Station on Bay Meadows Road to purchase a bottle of wine [04:28:13]. As they pulled into the parking lot, a red Dodge Durango, occupied by 18-year-old Tommy Storms (who was inside buying cigarettes) and his three friends, Leyland Brunson, [[david_tronis_and_shanti_cooper_murder_case | Jordan Davis]], and Tevin Thompson, was already parked next to an empty spot Dunn could have taken [04:44:59]. Dunn chose not to park in the empty spot next to the sidewalk because he heard loud music and "didn't want to deal with it" [05:00:46]. He then parked next to the Durango on the passenger side [05:22:42]. Dunn commented to Rauer, "I hate that thug music" [05:43:03]. Rauer then went into the store [05:58:36].

### The Confrontation and Shooting
While Rauer was in the store, Dunn asked the occupants of the Durango to turn their music down, stating, "Can you turn the music down, I can't hear myself think?" [06:05:14]. Tevin Thompson initially complied, turning the music down [06:14:48]. However, Jordan Davis, who was in the back seat, told Thompson to "Turn the music back up" [06:27:07]. Tommy Storms then returned to the Durango [06:31:07]. Dunn then asked Jordan Davis, "Are you talking to me?" [06:46:27]. Davis responded, "Yeah, I'm talking to you" [07:01:03]. Dunn then said loudly, "No, you're not gonna talk to me that way" [07:07:37].

According to a witness, Dunn reached into his glove compartment, pulled out a large silver chrome gun (either a nine-millimeter or .45 caliber), held it, and cocked it back [07:14:14]. Within three minutes of Dunn pulling into the gas station, he fired a total of 10 shots into the Durango [07:53:13]. The first three shots went through the back passenger side door as Tommy Storms put the SUV in reverse [07:59:16]. Shots five, six, and seven came through the front passenger side door [08:08:44]. As the SUV performed a J-turn to leave, Dunn exited his car, aimed at the retreating vehicle, and fired three more shots into the back [08:12:08]. Jordan Davis was struck three times in the leg, lungs, and heart, causing him to bleed to death in under 45 seconds [08:48:07]. He was 17 years old [08:57:43].

## Aftermath and Interrogation
Approximately 20 seconds after the gunfire ceased, Rhonda Rauer realized her fiancée had fired shots [08:59:43]. Dunn told her to "Get in the car" with urgency in his voice [09:12:20]. As they drove away, Rauer asked what happened, and Dunn replied, "I shot at the car" [09:40:48]. When asked why, Dunn claimed, "They threatened to kill me" and that "they started to advance" [09:57:56]. He told her he just shot at the car and didn't hurt anyone [10:16:03]. Rauer kept her negative thoughts to herself, deciding to address them in the morning [10:40:02].

They returned to their hotel, where Dunn walked their dog, ordered pizza, and poured himself a rum and coke before they went to sleep with almost no conversation [10:52:50]. The next morning, Rauer saw news coverage of a shooting at a convenience store involving a red SUV and a dead person [11:06:55]. She alerted Dunn, who said, "Yes, I saw" [11:53:13]. Rauer then insisted they go home, and they drove straight back to their house, listening to the radio. Dunn periodically turned it down to say "I love you" [12:02:40].

Witnesses at the scene recorded Dunn's license plate, leading police to track him to his Brevard County home [13:01:57]. He was brought to the JSO police department and subjected to interrogation, which began 22 hours after the shooting [13:08:16].

### Michael Dunn's Interrogation
During the interrogation, Dunn attempted to portray himself as a [[emotional_responses_in_criminal_investigations | victim]] who had no choice but to act [13:40:00]. He wanted to appear rational, reasonable, and considerate, knowing someone had died due to his actions [13:51:39].

Dunn initially stated that after he asked them to turn the music down and they complied, "the music comes back on" and a guy in the back seat was "getting really agitated" [14:36:26]. He claimed he couldn't hear everything, but there was "a lot of f--- him and f--- that" [15:15:23]. He then claimed he heard them saying "kill him" and "kill that son of a b---" [16:11:00]. He said he put his window down again and asked, "Excuse me, are you talking about me?" [16:16:32]. He then claimed the guy went to the ground and came up with "something," which he thought was a shotgun, saying, "You're dead, b---" [16:35:05]. Dunn stated he was "scared s---less" and then reached for his pistol in the glove box, unholstered it, and fired [16:47:06]. He claimed he was proficient with guns and had a round chambered quickly [16:59:04].

Dunn initially claimed he shot four times [17:54:19]. As the SUV pulled out, he said he was still scared and shot "four more times because they were fleeing" [18:18:03]. He said he got out of his car and fired more shots, claiming he didn't feel safe because he thought they had a gun and his fiancée was in the store [18:34:03]. He expressed regret over missing an expensive bed and breakfast in St. Augustine due to the incident [19:06:04].

Detectives highlighted the inconsistencies in Dunn's story:
*   **Lack of Weapon**: They stated there was "no weapon in the car" that Dunn claimed to see [26:44:17]. Dunn's description of what he saw shifted from a "shotgun" to "a barrel" and then "a barrel or a stick" [23:54:33].
*   **Continued Shooting**: The detectives questioned why Dunn continued to shoot as the vehicle was backing away, arguing that a fleeing vehicle is "no longer a threat" [27:58:34]. Dunn tried to justify this by saying, "in my mind, they had a weapon" and that he was "keeping them from doing that" (shooting back) [28:19:07].
*   **Leaving the Scene**: Detectives pressed Dunn on why he didn't call 911 from the hotel, but instead ordered pizza. Dunn claimed he was still afraid and wanted to return to his hometown to report it [21:56:04]. The detective contrasted this with a previous case where an individual immediately called 911 after a perceived threat [23:10:04].
*   **Victim's Location**: Dunn claimed Jordan Davis was getting out of the car when he fired [30:36:36]. Forensics refuted this, showing Davis was hit while sitting in the back seat and the door was shut, proven by bullet angles [32:25:27].
*   **Victim's Background**: Detectives informed Dunn that Jordan Davis had no history of violence and was not a "violent kid," making Dunn's claims of being threatened to death less credible [35:36:20].

As the interrogation progressed, Dunn showed signs of stress, stating he was "not feeling so hot" and his stomach was sick [44:34:04]. He continued to insist he was in "fear for my life" and "only reacted" [44:51:27]. When he asked if he needed a lawyer, detectives informed him that Duval County had issued a warrant for his arrest for murder and attempted murder, with no bond [45:37:37]. Dunn expressed surprise and disappointment, stating, "That sucks" [47:11:00].

### Rhonda Rauer's Testimony
Four days after the shooting, Rhonda Rauer was interviewed. She confirmed that Dunn never told her he saw a gun, a weapon of any kind, a stick, a shotgun, a barrel, or a lead pipe in the red SUV, either on the way to the hotel, at the hotel, or during the two-hour drive home [55:20:00]. This directly contradicted Dunn's claims during his interrogation and trial.

## Trial and Conviction
Dunn's statements during [[chris_watts_interrogation_analysis | his interrogation]] were compared to his testimony in court. During the trial, Dunn's testimony showed a "considerable increase in both emphasis and conviction" when describing the threats he perceived, such as hearing "kill that b---" and seeing Jordan Davis pick up "a barrel" and threaten him with a gun [48:51:08]. He added details not mentioned in his interrogation, such as Davis saying, "This s---'s going down now" [50:10:14]. He claimed he was in "fixed position with the tunnel vision" and didn't realize the SUV was moving when he continued to shoot, worried about "blind firing" [51:11:09].

Dunn became emotional in court when discussing his love for Rhonda Rauer and their dog, Charlie, portraying himself as noble and selfless [52:54:19]. However, the prosecution noted he showed no emotion when describing the moment he took a young man's life [53:46:33].

On February 15, 2014, Michael Dunn was found guilty on three counts of attempted murder, receiving a 90-year sentence [56:20:00]. Seven months later, on October 1, 2014, he was given an additional life sentence without the possibility of parole for the murder of Jordan Davis [56:29:08]. His appeal was denied on November 17, 2016 [56:35:10]. He is currently held at the maximum security Oregon State Penitentiary [56:41:26].

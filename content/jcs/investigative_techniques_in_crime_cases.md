The investigation into the disappearance of Savannah Gold on August 2, 2017, showcased a series of deliberate and strategic [[crime_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | investigative techniques]] employed by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. Savannah, a 21-year-old waitress at Bonefish Grill, disappeared after leaving her parents' home for her 5:30 p.m. shift, never arriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Initial Investigation and Evidence Gathering

Suspicions arose about an hour and fifteen minutes after Savannah left her home, when her father received a text message from her phone that seemed uncharacteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Her brother also received a similar text shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. The messages contained errors and were composed in a way Savannah would not normally write, and her phone was switched off when family tried to call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. After confirming she hadn't shown up for work, police were called, and a missing-persons report was filed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

Approximately 40 minutes later, Savannah's car was found unlocked and abandoned in the Bonefish Grill parking lot, with only her phone missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

### Key Evidence: Surveillance Footage

Investigators immediately reviewed the parking lot surveillance tapes, uncovering a crucial piece of evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. While the majority of the footage remained undisclosed, a detailed description was released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>:
*   Savannah parked her car and exited at 5:31 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   She walked to another vehicle and conversed with the occupant for 14 minutes through the driver's side window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   At 5:45 p.m., she entered the backseat of that vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   Fourteen seconds later, the car began to shake sporadically, suggesting a struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
*   The rear door swung open and was forcefully shut three times, indicating someone attempting to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. This struggle lasted 49 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   A male figure then exited the vehicle, walked to Savannah's car, took what was believed to be her phone, and slashed her front tire with a knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   The man drove away at 6:04 p.m., and Savannah was never seen exiting his car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Strategic Evidence Concealment
Investigators understood the importance of keeping the surveillance footage confidential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Revealing this information could allow a suspect to alter their alibi to match the evidence, giving them a significant advantage during [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation]] and hindering the case building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Identifying a Suspect

Over the next two days, [[the_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | investigators]] discreetly interviewed Bonefish Grill staff, asking three key questions: "When was the last time you saw Savannah?", "Do you know where she is?", and "Is there anything you know that could help with our investigation?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Within 48 hours, they identified three potential suspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

By running their names through the motor insurance database, they found Leroy Dougherty, a 28-year-old manager and head chef at Bonefish Grill, owned a 2012 silver Chevy Malibuâ€”an identical match to the vehicle seen on surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Dougherty had initially told investigators he hadn't seen Savannah in three weeks and knew nothing of her whereabouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. However, coworkers revealed he had an on-and-off relationship with Savannah, despite company policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Leroy Dougherty became the prime suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## Interrogation Strategies

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office meticulously planned their next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Leroy Dougherty was arrested at work on August 5th at 5:15 p.m., under the guise of an outstanding traffic warrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This was the beginning of their [[interrogation_techniques_used_by_detectives | interrogation technique]].

### Psychological Tactics
*   **Initial Isolation and Anxiety Induction:** Dougherty was left alone in the interrogation room for 90 minutes, with the officer stating he would "be right back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. This period of uncertainty and isolation was designed to allow anxiety to fester, knowing he had been interviewed about Savannah's disappearance just the day before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   **Targeted Re-introduction of Investigator:** The "brief moment of alleviation" when the door opened would have instantly converted to shock as Detective Rae Reeves, the same investigator who interviewed him previously, walked through the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. This confirmed to Dougherty that his situation was "far more severe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Open-Ended Questions:** The detective began with an open-ended question ("Savannah, you said that you knew her and you guys had you knew her from work?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. This strategy is based on the belief that truthful individuals give short, concise answers, while those with something to hide provide lengthy, detailed responses in an attempt to seek approval and appease the perceived threat of the interrogator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. Leroy's detailed account of his relationship with Savannah, her drug use, and their breakup fit this pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.
*   **Allowing Alibi Amendment:** The investigators allowed Dougherty to amend his alibi when he stated, "I didn't tell you the truth when we talked about the fish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. This allowed him to admit seeing her recently in the parking lot and discuss a verbal argument, without revealing the full extent of the evidence held by police. This kept the capacity of the evidence hidden for a more critical moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.
*   **Locking into Fabrication:** Dougherty claimed Savannah got out of his car and walked towards the main entrance, eventually getting into a green pickup truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. By allowing him to elaborate on this fabricated story, detectives locked him into a stated alibi under caution, making any later amendments lose credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.
*   **False Sense of Security:** The detective continued to inquire about the fabricated story, pretending to believe him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>. This technique lowers the suspect's guard, reduces anxiety, and increases their belief that they are fooling the detectives, setting them up for a sudden confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>.

### Confrontation and Pressure
*   **First Confrontation (Sudden Shift):** After Dougherty became more at ease, the detective initiated a sharp and sudden shift, asking him about injuries on his neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>. This disoriented him, affecting his ability to think critically or fabricate emotion convincingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Accusation:** The interrogation escalated with a direct accusation: "Where's Savannah right now? I don't know where would I find her?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>. Innocent subjects typically reciprocate aggression, while Dougherty's composed demeanor suggested he was anticipating such a blunt confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Appeal and Character Attack:** The detective used emotional appeals ("This is someone's child") and attacked his character, stating they don't care about his feelings but are focused on finding Savannah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a>. They relentlessly demanded, "Where did you go with her?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35:00">[29:35:00]</a>.

### Revelation of Evidence and Confession
The most substantial piece of evidence, the surveillance footage, was revealed at a pivotal moment to maximize pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>. The female detective stated, "She was in your car, she never got out of your car... We can prove that you left with her in the car... Video cameras don't lie, Lee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>. The detectives then used a combination of the "how and why solution" and "alternative question" techniques to lower the threshold of admission, suggesting possibilities like an overdose to make a confession seem more morally acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Leroy Dougherty admitted to killing Savannah Gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:23:00">[33:23:00]</a>. He claimed he broke her neck, took her body to his house, burned it in a self-made fire pit, and dumped her remains in a lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29:00">[33:29:00]</a>. The medical examiner confirmed Savannah had injuries to over 75% of her body, and her death was ruled a violent homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39:00">[33:39:00]</a>.

Despite the overwhelming evidence and his confession, Dougherty later pled not guilty, claiming self-defense against the 5-foot-tall, 91-pound Savannah, stating he accidentally broke her neck after she slapped him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>. His trial was expected to commence in the summer of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37:00">[39:37:00]</a>.

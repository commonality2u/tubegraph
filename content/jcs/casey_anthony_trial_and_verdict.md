The primary subject of this article is the psychological constitution of [[casey_anthony_psychological_profile | Casey Marie Anthony]], mother of two-year-old [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee Anthony]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee]] sadly passed away at some point between 1 PM and 8 PM on June 16, 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The focus shifted from the "how" or "why" of [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee's]] death to her mother's response to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. [[casey_anthony_psychological_profile | Casey Anthony]] was evaluated by two clinical psychologists during her time in custody, and no psychological abnormalities or signs of mental illness were discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Initial Discovery and Investigation
On July 15, 2008, Orlando police received a 911 call from Cindy Anthony, [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee's]] grandmother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Cindy reported that [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee]] had been missing for a month and that [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] had finally admitted the baby was "taken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Cindy also stated that [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey's]] car smelled like "a dead body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

[[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey Anthony]] had left the family home a month earlier with her daughter, claiming she had a work assignment in Tampa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. She repeatedly told [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee's]] grandparents that she was busy with work and that [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee]] was with a nanny named Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez (Zanny) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

On July 15, [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey's]] father, George Anthony, was informed that the family car was at the impound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Upon retrieving it, he noticed a strong odor from the trunk, which he recognized as human decomposition from his police officer background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] was tracked down at her boyfriend's house, smoking marijuana and watching TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. She claimed [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee]] had been kidnapped 31 days prior by the babysitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This prompted Cindy's 911 call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

During the 911 call, [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey's]] voice lacked urgency or concern, in stark contrast to her mother's distraught tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Police immediately suspected her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Interrogations and Fabrications
Detectives interviewed [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]], a strategy to lock her into lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] described "Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez" as a nanny she knew for nearly four years through a mutual friend, Jeffrey Michael Hopkins, at Universal Studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. She claimed "Zaneda" watched both [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee]] and Jeffrey's son at his house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

However, Jeffrey Hopkins stated he was only an acquaintance of [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]], never worked at Universal at the same time as her, never introduced her to a Zaneda Gonzalez, and never used a nanny by that name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. He also had no children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The "nanny" Zaneda did not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

[[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] also claimed to have spoken about [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee's]] disappearance with "Juliette Lewis," a coworker at Universal, who also did not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] had only briefly worked at Universal over two years prior and was a photo kiosk seller, not an event coordinator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. She attributed not calling the police earlier to being "naive" and "scared" that something would happen to [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee]] if authorities or media were involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

[[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey's]] ability to lie without conscience and her history of getting away with misconduct, such as skipping her senior year of high school and her parents covering for her, were noted as significant influences on her behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

After her initial statement, [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] led investigators to multiple fake addresses and then to a non-existent office at Universal Studios before admitting she didn't work there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. She was then arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Calls from Jail and Bail
In jail, [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] reacted to seeing her mother on TV with apparent nonchalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. She blamed her situation on her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. She stated she didn't want her family at her bond hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

During a visit with her parents nine days into her custody, [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] was emotionally exhausted and for a brief moment expressed pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. However, this pain seemed to be for herself, as she showed no emotion when seeing [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee's]] face on her father's shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. Her parents' attempts to get information about [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee's]] whereabouts were largely dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. She dismissed people trying to help with the search, calling them "psycho" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

[[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey's]] attorney, Jose Baez, eventually secured her bail, and she was released on August 21, 2008, after just over a month in custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

## Discovery of Remains and Murder Charge
On December 11, 2008, just under five months after she was reported missing, [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee's]] skeletal remains were discovered in a swamp less than a mile from the Anthony household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. She was found wrapped in a Winnie-the-Pooh blanket and placed in a canvas laundry bag, with duct tape discovered around her skull's nose and mouth area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. Her death was ruled a homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.

Two months after her release, police were granted permission to arrest [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] on the charge of first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>. During this [[legal_proceedings_and_trial_outcomes | interrogation]], [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] immediately requested her right to counsel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. She maintained a confident and talkative disposition, which was later analyzed as an attempt to mask anxiety and conceal guilty behavior through a "fake" yet natural fraudulent demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>. She was ultimately kept in the county jail for two and a half years awaiting trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>.

## The Trial (May 24, 2011)
The trial commenced on May 24, 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>. Prosecutors announced they would be seeking the death penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>.

### Prosecution's Argument
The prosecution's argument was that [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] suffocated her daughter with duct tape, placed her in a trunk for days, and then disposed of her body in the swamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. The primary motive was for [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] to live a "good life" free from the responsibilities of motherhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

Key points presented by the prosecution:
*   Last day [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee]] was seen alive (June 16, 2008), [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey Anthony]] made internet searches for "how to make chloroform" and "neck breaking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>.
*   That evening, [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] and her boyfriend were seen at a Blockbuster, with [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee]] nowhere in sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   In the following weeks, [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] went out partying, participated in a hot body contest, and got a tattoo reading "Bella Vita" (beautiful life) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.
*   Her diary entry around the same time read: "I completely trust my own judgment and I knew that I made the right decision this is the happiest that I have been in a very long time I hope that my happiness will continue to grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.
*   The placement of duct tape on [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee's]] face, mouth, and nose indicated a specific intent to end her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.
*   No one else had access to all the pieces of evidence (duct tape, laundry bag, blanket, shorts, shirt, car) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>.
*   No one else lied to friends, family, or investigators, and no one else benefited from [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee's]] death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

### Defense's Argument
The defense was led by Jose Baez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>. They dropped a bombshell in their opening statements to create doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>.

Jose Baez stated:
> "She never was missing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a> [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee Anthony]] died on June 16, 2008 when she drowned in her family's swimming pool." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>

The defense argued that [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey's]] behavior was due to her history of hiding pain and secrets stemming from her father, George Anthony, allegedly molesting her since she was eight years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>. They claimed this taught her to lie immediately and pretend "as if nothing ever happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>, which explained why no one knew her child was dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>.

### Closing Arguments
The trial lasted six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. Closing arguments were presented on Sunday, July 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.

The prosecution summarized that the case was about the clash between the responsibility of a child and [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey's]] desire for a free life, stating that "the choice she made was her child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>.

Jose Baez focused on the lack of answers to key questions, particularly "how did [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee]] die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>, and stressed that the case must not be decided on emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. He argued the prosecution deliberately tried to make the jury hate [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] to sway them toward a guilty verdict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>. Baez insisted that if the jury had questions, the case was "not proven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.

## The Verdict and Aftermath
On July 5, 2011, the jury delivered its verdict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

### Verdict
*   **Count One: First-Degree Murder** - Not Guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>
*   **Count Two: Aggravated Child Abuse** - Not Guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>
*   **Count Three: Aggravated Manslaughter of a Child** - Not Guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>

### Post-Verdict Statement
Jose Baez, outside the courtroom, expressed disgust for "media assassination" and "incompetent talking heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>. He stated that [[casey_anthonys_behavior_and_public_perception | Casey]] did not murder [[kaylee_anthonys_disappearance_and_investigation | Kaylee]] and that the justice system "has not dishonored her memory by a false conviction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>.

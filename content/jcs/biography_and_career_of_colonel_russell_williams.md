From: [[jcs]] <br/> 

Colonel Russell Williams enrolled in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in 1987 and quickly advanced through the ranks due to his reputation as an elite pilot and a "shining bright star" in the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. By January 1, 1991, he had been promoted to Captain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His ascension continued, reaching the rank of Colonel in June 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Military Career and Authority

As a Colonel, Williams was appointed commanding officer at CFB Trenton, Canada's largest air force base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. In this role, he commanded over 7,000 military personnel, all of whom referred to him as "Colonel" or "Colonel Williams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This position afforded him extensive psychosocial equanimity and confidence, extending beyond his work life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. His title was printed on identification, and formal encounters with figures of authority like doctors, lawyers, or police officers would involve addressing him by his professional rank, which further boosted his composure and self-assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

This established pattern of respect for his rank had one significant exception: the day he met Detective Sergeant Jim Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Becoming a Suspect

The investigation into [[crimes_committed_by_russell_williams | Williams's crimes]] began to focus on him following the disappearance of 27-year-old Jessica Lloyd on January 28, 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Jessica failed to show up for work and was unresponsive to calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Her brother, Andy Lloyd, found her isolated home on Ontario's Highway 37 empty, with no signs of forced entry, but all her personal items, including her phone and passport, left inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:02:07]</a>.

Given Ottawa's low crime rate, a missing person's investigation was launched immediately, involving the Ottawa police force, public volunteers, and a search and rescue unit from the Canadian Air Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:30]</a>. An anonymous tip about an SUV parked unusually near Jessica's house at 3 AM led police to discover tire tracks and boot prints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:03:10]</a>.

Police set up roadblocks, stopping over 200 SUVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:27]</a>. On February 4, Colonel Russell Williams's sports utility vehicle was stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:44]</a>. His tires matched the tracks found near Jessica Lloyd's house, leading to him being placed under immediate police surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:04:02]</a>.

## The Interrogation

On Sunday, February 7, Williams was called to police headquarters in Ottawa for questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:13]</a>. He arrived just before 3 PM, where he was met by Detective Sergeant Jim Smith, a polygraph technician and senior investigator from the policing behavioral sciences unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:33]</a>.

From the outset, Detective Smith informally addressed Williams by his first name, "Russell," purposefully taking him down from his "elevated platform" to strip away his confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:15]</a>. This tactic was designed to increase telling signs in body language and intonation if information was fabricated, and to decrease cognitive stamina, thereby lessening the time an individual could maintain a facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:27]</a>.

Williams was informed that he was not under arrest and was free to leave at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:09]</a>. However, the detective subtly positioned himself between Williams and the door, a common [[case_study_of_wrongful_arrest_and_interrogation | interrogation strategy]] to subliminally imply that leaving required going "through me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Initial Questions and Alibis

Detective Smith explained that they were investigating four occurrences: two sexual assaults in September 2009 in the Tweed area, the murder of Corporal Marie-France Como in November 2009, and Jessica Lloyd's disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:09:15]</a>. He listed potential charges, including first-degree murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, and forcible confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:34]</a>.

Williams's initial responses, particularly regarding his schedule and recollection of events, showed signs of discomposure and agitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:53]</a>. He struggled to recall details of his activities, including the day he learned of Marie-France Como's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14]-[00:16:42]</a>.

He claimed he was at his vacation home in Tweed, Ontario, a village roughly 125 miles from his main residence, on the Friday Jessica Lloyd disappeared, suffering from a stomach flu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25]-[00:13:35]</a>.

### Confrontation and Confession

The detective then directly confronted Williams with the evidence. He presented him with a photocopy of a boot impression found at Jessica Lloyd's house, claiming it was from Williams's own boot taken earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55]-[00:22:00]</a>. He exaggerated the reliability of footwear impressions, stating they were "pretty much in the area of a fingerprints" and that experts could compare features to prove they were "identical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34]-[00:22:23]</a>. This was a fabricated affirmation designed to heighten psychological pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:47]</a>. He then asserted: "Your vehicle drove up the side of Jessica Lloyd's house. Your boots walked to the back of Jessica Lloyd's house on the evening of the 28th and 29th of January" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32]-[00:22:42]</a>.

Williams was told that a search warrant was being executed at his Tweed residence, his wife now knew what was happening, and his vehicle had been seized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12]-[00:24:27]</a>. The detective falsely claimed that DNA found on Marie-France Como's body would match him, and that forensic experts were on call 24/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43]-[00:25:00]</a>. He emphasized that Williams's "credibility is gone" once the evidence is fully confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.

Under this intense pressure, Williams began to break down. He struggled with how "upset" his life was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:08]</a>. The detective framed his cooperation as an opportunity to "minimize the impact on my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09]-[00:31:16]</a>.

Eventually, Williams confessed to Jessica Lloyd's murder and provided the location of her body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51]-[00:32:12]</a>. He stated that she had been there for over a week and lived for almost 24 hours after being taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55]-[00:33:21]</a>. He also admitted to observing Jessica on her treadmill on Wednesday night, returning to her house on Thursday when she wasn't there, and then going back in through the back patio door while she was sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13]-[00:34:56]</a>.

Williams also confessed to the murder of Marie-France Como. He described entering her home through an open basement window when she was away, and then returning later at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10]-[00:35:26]</a>. He recounted being discovered by Como's cat, which fixated on him, leading Como to come downstairs and find him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32]-[00:35:58]</a>. He then subdued her, tied her up, and strangled her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13]-[00:36:20]</a>.

Williams admitted he didn't know why he did these things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

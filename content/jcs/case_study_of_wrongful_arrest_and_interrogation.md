## Principles of Interrogation Analysis

When evaluating information during [[investigation_tactics_and_police_interrogation | interrogation analysis]], hindsight provides a considerable advantage, especially when the subject's guilt is already known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The knowledge of an outcome allows for the exclusive focus on guilty behavior, highlighting imperatives and stripping away non-essentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

The aphorism "hindsight is 20/20" is particularly compatible with the innocent, as the information required to scrutinize is reduced when dealing with innocent subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. When factors like misdirection and trickery are removed, the behavior of an innocent person tends to be relatively straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

While human beings are unique and can react differently, and trauma can cause atypical behavior, atypical behavior and guilty behavior can generally be distinguished with relative ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Case Study: Michael Dixon

### Arrest and Initial Interrogation
On August 15, 2003, in Hamilton, Ontario, 37-year-old Michael Dixon was arrested at gunpoint after police chased a jewelry store perpetrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Dixon, described as popular, friendly, unassuming, and a self-professed introvert, was getting off a bus nearby and was the first person police saw coming out of an alley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. He voiced his innocence but did not resist arrest, offering to help in any way he could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

He was taken to the Hamilton police station and questioned two hours after his arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Policing Misstep
> The 9-1-1 call described the suspect as a small, white man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Michael Dixon, however, was not white and stood 6'3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. This suggests the detective either forgot to review the dispatch call or deliberately rejected it as evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

Michael was informed the room was recorded and read his rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. He asserted his willingness to speak with the detective and help with the [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | investigation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

The detective immediately stated that Dixon's innocence or guilt was "not an issue," as the evidence was "conclusive and overwhelming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. The detective's aim was to ascertain "what kind of guy" Dixon was, whether he was a "serial burglar" or if this was a "one-off thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

### Michael's Demeanor and Response
During the [[detective_interrogation_techniques | interrogation]], Michael maintained a forward-leaning posture, consistent eye contact, and poise, while the detective appeared to show a nervous disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Michael's non-verbal behavior, including an exaggerated head movement to emphasize maintaining eye contact, is recognized in forensic psychology as a "non-verbal challenge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This was a way of asserting dominance and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

Despite the detective's statements, Michael continued to assert his innocence, acknowledging that the detective had likely heard such claims many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. He offered to answer questions but stated he had no answer as to *why* he would have done it, since he claimed he didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Anomaly in Innocent Behavior
> Michael's "incredibly tolerant" composure and "forgiving" demeanor in the face of injustice are unusual compared to typical responses from innocent subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

The detective claimed there were witnesses and video camera evidence, which confused Michael since he knew he was innocent and couldn't be on video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. Michael suggested getting a lawyer if this was the approach the police were taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. He then directly challenged the detective, asking if the mention of a video camera was a bluff to gauge his reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

Despite being noticeably afraid when realizing he would be charged and not going home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>, Michael reacted with reasoning and intuitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. He continued to profess his innocence calmly for another seven minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. He drew a map specifying his movements before arrest, and every detail of his alibi was later proven 100% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

### Outcome of Michael Dixon's Case
Michael was held in jail for three and a half days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>. A separate investigator later looked into his alibi witnesses and checked area surveillance, leading to his immediate exoneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. A civil trial followed, and Michael was awarded $46,000 in punitive damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>. The interrogating officer and three other investigators involved were demoted and suspended without pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Justin

### False Accusation and Interrogation
26-year-old Justin was falsely accused of breaking and entering, first-degree theft, and assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. He was arrested at home and only read his rights while on the way to the police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. He was unaware he would be wrongfully imprisoned for just over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

Initially, Justin viewed his interrogators as an inconvenience rather than a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. His responses were short and concise, and he did not seek approval, only responding to questions or stating a point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

The [[police_interrogation_strategies | detective's strategy]] was to reveal the charges periodically, aiming to get a confession to one charge at a time rather than all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. The plan was to reveal the break-in and robbery charge first, followed by the assault charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

The detective stated that an accuser named Candy claimed she saw him loitering and then breaking in and stealing items, and she picked him out of a 12-picture lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Justin's Response to Accusation
Upon learning of the burglary charge, which carried a possible 20-year prison sentence due to previous convictions, Justin began to forcefully assert his innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. He leaned forward and strengthened his vocal emphasis with each assertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. He repeatedly denied knowing Candy or breaking into her house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. He mentioned that the only "Candy" he knew was a guy named Tim, who was the accuser's ex-boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

The detective then revealed Justin was accused of assaulting the victim during the robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. Justin vehemently denied this, suggesting the injuries were caused by Candy's ex-boyfriend, Tim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

Justin, having previously served three years for a robbery in his early twenties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>, likely knew the investigator's reassuring tone was a bad sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] [[Innocent versus guilty behavior during interrogations | Innocent versus Guilty Behavior]]
> Justin's aggressive but defensive form of aggression is a common response from innocent subjects when directly accused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. He was not hostile but combative, a justified conduct when facing significant prison time for something not committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

### Outcome of Justin's Case
The accuser's [[witness_testimonies_and_police_interrogation | testimony]] was later picked apart in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. She was caught lying multiple times on the stand, and Justin was exonerated, proven innocent "beyond all doubt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

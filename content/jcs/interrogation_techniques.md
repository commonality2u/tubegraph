[[interrogation_techniques_and_tactics | Interrogation techniques]] involve various strategies and questions used by detectives to elicit information or confessions from suspects. These methods often combine psychological pressure, observation of behavioral responses, and the strategic use of information.

## Behavior-Provoking Questions

One common [[interrogation_techniques_and_strategies_used_by_detectives | interrogation technique]] is the use of "behavior-provoking questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These questions are designed to elicit distinct responses depending on the subject's guilt or innocence.

*   **Draconian Response**
    An innocent person will typically give what is known as a "draconian response," immediately suggesting the harshest possible sentence for the crime they are falsely accused of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
    > "When we find the guy who took him, what do you think we should do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
    > "Life in prison would be..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
    > "That's what I was, that's what I would think with two kids that are involved." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   **Equivocating Response**
    A deceptive individual, conversely, will often give an "equivocating response," fragmenting or diverting from the question to avoid a direct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. They might focus on unrelated details or express uncertainty about the legal system.
    > "I'm not sure if like that penalty is even used to use in Colorado, I am not sure what is the death penalty." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>

## Information Gathering and Strategic Disclosure

Detectives often enter an [[the_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | interrogation]] with pre-existing knowledge about the suspect, which they may strategically disclose or imply.

*   **Leveraging Pre-existing Information**
    Interrogators may be aware of facts, such as infidelity, that the suspect has attempted to conceal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This information can be used to challenge a suspect's credibility.
    > "I did not cheat on my life." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
    [!INFO] The interrogator was already aware that Chris was cheating on his wife with a woman by the name of Nicole Kessinger. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   **Digital Forensics**
    Law enforcement agencies like the FBI possess programs capable of recovering deleted digital exchanges from devices, even long after they have been erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This technological capability provides a powerful tool for gathering evidence.

## Psychological Tactics

[[interrogation_and_psychological_analysis | Psychological analysis]] is crucial in [[crime_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | crime investigation and interrogation techniques]], with officers employing various methods to influence a suspect's mental state.

*   **Amplifying Anxiety**
    Detectives may intentionally amplify a suspect's anxiety, especially before critical procedures like a polygraph test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This heightened apprehension aims to make it more challenging for a guilty subject to maintain deception.
    > "I'm not the only one who thinks that there's a possibility you have something to do with this... Everyone [thinks that]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
    The interrogator might also describe how a suspect's mind will race after the interview, encouraging them to call back with new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Passive Accusation / Reframing**
    An interrogator may use a technique known as "passive accusation," where they indirectly accuse and "indignify" the suspect while seemingly praising them for trivial deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This is often done when the interrogator is almost certain of the suspect's guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
    > "Those kids have a good dad and I know it... A lot of dads don't get second pairs of clothes and cook eggs and give them snacks at night. You know a lot of men, that's a woman for it. You're not that kind of guy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>

## Polygraph Examination Techniques

Polygraph tests are a significant tool in [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation]], incorporating specific procedures and psychological pressure.

*   **Pre-test Phase: Psychological Pressure Disguised as Reassurance**
    During the pre-test phase, a polygrapher may reassure the suspect of their expertise and the test's accuracy, stating that if the suspect is innocent, it will be proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This is described as psychological pressure disguised as reassurance, used when guilt is almost conclusive to increase the challenge of deception for the suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
    > "I will use the most validated testing that the way I'm going to ask you the questions, so believe me if you had nothing to do with this I will be able to show them that today." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>
    The polygrapher also explicitly states the only two ways to fail the test:
    1.  Failing to follow instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    2.  Choosing to lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
    They may emphasize the foolishness of taking the test if one is guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Obtaining Examinee's Version of Facts**
    The polygrapher will obtain the examinee's version of the facts regarding the specific issues under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. They may also ask the suspect to describe ways one could make someone disappear through murder, despite the suspect's denial of involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This ensures the suspect understands the scope of the "relevant questions" to be asked during the test.
*   **Directed Lie Polygraph**
    This type of polygraph involves three question categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>:
    *   **Known Truth Questions:** Easy questions (e.g., "Are you sitting down?") that provide a baseline for truthful responses and help disconnect thought patterns between questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
    *   **Control Questions:** Questions that the examinee is *told* to lie about (e.g., "Before 2018, did you ever lose your temper with someone you cared about? No.") to gauge physiological responses to deliberate falsehoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.
    *   **Relevant Questions:** Questions directly related to the crime being investigated, where the examinee is expected to respond truthfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. A guilty subject will show a stronger reaction to relevant questions than to control questions, even when lying on both, due to the immediate threat of the relevant questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   **Immediate Confrontation of Results**
    After the polygraph, the results are typically disclosed promptly, and if the suspect fails, they are confronted with the findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
    > "It is completely clear that you were not honest during the testing and I think you already know that. He did not pass the polygraph test, right? Okay, so now we need to talk about what actually happens." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>
    The polygrapher may even mock the suspect's poor lying ability, further increasing psychological pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
    > "You obviously are a really bad liar. Have people told you that before? The second you tell a lie like they could tell on your face." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>
    They emphasize that now "there's only one person in this room that knows what the truth is, and in about five minutes there's gonna be two of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>, signaling that the truth is about to be revealed.

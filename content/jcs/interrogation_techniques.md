[[interrogation_strategies_and_techniques | Detective interrogation techniques]] are employed to elicit information from suspects, often involving careful preparation and psychological strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The objective is to maintain a casual conversation for as long as possible, waiting for key moments to initiate confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Ruse

To begin an [[interrogation_techniques_in_criminal_investigations | interrogation]], detectives may create a ruse to invite a suspect in, such as asking for advice on an unrelated case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Setting a Compatible Tone
A crucial first step is to establish a compatible tone with the suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Detectives aim to negate the negative implications of an [[interrogation_techniques_used_in_criminal_investigation | interrogation]] room environment through a friendly disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. For example, a consultative meeting, like seeking advice on an art theft, is presented as something that could happen anywhere, making the interrogation room seem an unusual but necessary choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Deceptive Reasoning for Location
The stated reason for meeting in an unusual location, such as an [[interrogation_techniques_and_strategy | interrogation]] room, is often to prevent the spread of rumors or innuendo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. However, the real reason can be to get the suspect to check in their firearm without raising suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Strategic Questioning and Observation

[[interrogation_analysis_techniques | Interrogation analysis techniques]] involve observing the suspect's reactions to specific questions and subtle cues.

### Mispronouncing Names
A simple strategy is to intentionally mispronounce a significant name to observe the suspect's reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The duration of a suspect's pause before responding can indicate deception; a pause four times longer than it should be suggests the suspect is acting as if they haven't thought about the name for a long time, when it is likely ingrained in their memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Volunteering Information
Truthful subjects often volunteer relevant information without being directly asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Deceptive subjects, however, tend to omit crucial details, even when not explicitly asked for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Observing Psychological Reactions
Detectives closely monitor psychological reactions during questioning:
*   **Fight or Flight**: When confronted with a threatening topic, a suspect's brain may trigger a hormonal response to prepare them to either deal with the threat or escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Exclamatory Remarks**: The continuous use of exclamatory remarks like "gosh" or "god" can be a suspect's attempt to insinuate a vague memory due to a supposed lack of contemplation on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This aims to create the impression that they had no reason to think about the subject matter for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Naive Reaction to Confrontation**: Guilty suspects may try to appear naive to a blatant confrontation as a means to avoid it entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Truthful subjects will typically address the confrontation directly, refuting it or seeking immediate clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Hyper-arousal/Terror Management Theory**: Suspects facing serious charges may exhibit hyper-arousal, leading them to over-explain trivial or irrelevant details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This is believed to be a subconscious coping mechanism to gain momentary relief from a terrifying reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Changes in Facial Expression**: A suspect's facial expression can reveal when they are genuinely searching their memory versus pretending to be reflective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Unmitigated Terror**: Recognizing "unmitigated terror" on a suspect's face can indicate the verbalization of a critical piece of information for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

## Escalating Pressure

As the [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | interrogation]] progresses, detectives will subtly ramp up pressure on the suspect.

### Avoiding Direct Answers
When a suspect challenges the detectives, the questions may be avoided, sometimes in a more confrontational manner without offering reassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The topic is maintained to increase pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Deceptive Reassurance
Conversely, detectives may offer deceptively reassuring responses to redirect the suspect's focus and create a false perception of being on their side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This can involve bringing the focus back to initial reasons for privacy or confidentiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Conclusion of Interrogation

### Request for DNA Sample
Detectives may request a DNA sample, such as a buccal swab, as a means to "identify or eliminate" the suspect, especially if evidence suggests potential DNA at a crime scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

### Miranda Rights
If the suspect indicates they feel accused or requests to speak to a lawyer, [[interrogation_techniques_and_legal_rights | Miranda rights]] must be read, informing them of their right to remain silent and to an attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

[!NOTE]
The suspect in this instance, Stephanie Lazarus, was found guilty of first-degree murder for the death of Sherri Rasmussen and was sentenced to 27 years to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. The impact of the event spanned a generation, causing pain to many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

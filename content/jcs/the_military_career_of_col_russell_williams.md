David Russell Williams enrolled in the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. By January 1, 1991, he was promoted to captain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, a rank that meant he would be addressed as "sir" by his subordinates and "captain Williams" by his superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Rise Through the Ranks
Described as an elite pilot and a "shining bright star" of the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, Williams quickly ascended through the ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. In June 2004, he was promoted to colonel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Commanding Officer at CFB Trenton
Simultaneously with his promotion to colonel, he was appointed the commanding officer at CFB Trenton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, which is Canada's largest air force base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. In this role, he commanded over 7,000 military personnel, all of whom referred to him as "colonel" or "colonel Williams" without exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Psychosocial Impact of Rank
His designated title of colonel afforded him extensive psychosocial equanimity and confidence, extending beyond his work life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. His title was printed on all forms of identification, and every formal encounter, including with doctors, lawyers, or police officers, would reinforce his military standing, boosting his composure and self-assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

This elevated social standing and military achievements were accentuated for all to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. However, this changed on the day he met [[interrogation_tactics_used_by_detective_sgt_jim_smith | Detective Sergeant Jim Smith]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Interrogation as Prime Suspect
Williams was stopped by police at approximately 7:30 p.m. on February 4th, 2010, at a roadblock set up during the search for Jessica Lloyd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. His SUV's tire tracks matched those found near Lloyd's house, leading to him being placed under police surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. On Sunday, February 7th, he received a call from police headquarters in Ottawa, requesting his presence for questioning related to an ongoing investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. He agreed to go immediately, telling his wife he would be back for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Upon arrival at the headquarters before 3 p.m., he was greeted by [[interrogation_tactics_used_by_detective_sgt_jim_smith | Detective Sergeant Jim Smith]], a trained polygraph technician and senior investigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. During the interrogation, Detective Smith purposefully refrained from addressing Williams by his formal military title, instead using his first name, "Russell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This tactic was used to strip away Williams's confidence, aiming to increase signs of discomposure and decrease cognitive stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

During the interrogation, Williams was identified as the prime suspect in a series of [[crimes_associated_with_col_russell_williams | crimes]], including the disappearance of Jessica Lloyd, the murder of Marie France Como, and other break-ins, rapes, and forcible confinements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He eventually confessed to these acts during the interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.

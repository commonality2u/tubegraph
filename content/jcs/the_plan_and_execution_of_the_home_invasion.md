The case of Jennifer Pan is notable for the extensive raw footage available, which provides significant insight into her psychological state and the events surrounding her family's home invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Jennifer herself narrated much of her story, leading to a condensed lead-up of events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Background to the Crime

Jennifer Pan was raised in Markham, Ontario, by her parents, Beak and Han, who were originally from Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Their parenting style was described as strict, even authoritarian, with success and achievement being seen as obligations for their children, often taking precedence over the children's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Jennifer initially excelled in figure skating, with expectations to compete in the Winter Olympics, but a serious knee injury at age 14 ended her dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Her parents' expectations then shifted to academics, where Jennifer struggled, averaging a C-minus when straight A's were demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. To meet these expectations, she began faking test results, report cards, a high school diploma, and even a university acceptance letter for pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. In reality, Jennifer was a high school dropout secretly living with her drug dealer boyfriend for almost eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

In 2010, at 24 years old, her double life was discovered, leading to an ultimatum: live at home under a strict regime, cease contact with her boyfriend, and return to school, or be disowned with all financial support cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Conceiving the Plan

Jennifer decided against both options presented by her parents and instead devised a third: arranging a mock home invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The plan was for three of her boyfriend's acquaintances to enter the Pan household, stage a robbery, ransack the home, and then murder her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

During her [[Jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | interrogation]], Jennifer later admitted that she was supposed to be the target, not her parents, and that she had asked the "hitman" to "take me out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>. She claimed she didn't know why they did it when her parents were there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>. The detective, however, asserted that the plan was always for her parents, not her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>.

## Execution of the Home Invasion

The planned date for the invasion was Monday, November 8th, with the scheduled time around 11 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### The Attack

Jennifer unlocked the front door, and three figures were captured on a neighbor's surveillance camera entering the home at 11:05 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. They were seen running out just under 18 minutes later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Jennifer's initial account of the night to the police included:
*   Hearing her mother call for her father, then unfamiliar voices downstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   Peering out of her bedroom door to find a man who tied her arms behind her back with string and claimed to have a gun, demanding money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   Her mother trying to get up, being told to sit down by the intruders, and Jennifer telling her mother to comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   The intruders keeping the lights off on the main floor, only using light from the fridge door to look for her mother's purse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   One of the men asking her father for money and his wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   Being taken upstairs by two assailants to show them where her father's wallet was, but not knowing where his pants were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   The intruders retrieving $1,100 from the master bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   Being tied to the upstairs banister and left alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   Hearing her parents go downstairs, her mother asking for Jennifer to come with them, and being told they wouldn't let her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   The intruders saying "You lied to us, you lied to us" before she heard two "pops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   Her mother screaming, followed by more pops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   Hearing a moan from her mother and one more shot before the men said, "we have to go now it's been too long" and ran out the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>.
*   Hearing her father run up the stairs after the intruders left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   Calling 911 using her phone, which she had hidden in her waistband behind her back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### Description of Intruders

Jennifer described the individual who appeared to be in charge as a black male with dreadlocks that were "flopping all over the place," making it hard to see his face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>. She recalled seeing the top part of a black gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>. She stated that one intruder stayed with her parents downstairs, while another was with her when she was taken upstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>. She confirmed seeing a total of three individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>. She further asserted that the first speaker sounded Canadian with no accent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. The second intruder did not speak, and the third had a Caribbean accent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>.

### Immediate Aftermath

Beak Pan was shot twice, in the neck and head, and was killed immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Han Pan was also shot twice, in the shoulder and face, but astonishingly survived and was placed in an induced coma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Jennifer was taken to the same hospital as a precaution, was cleared of injury, and sat by her father's bedside for about three hours before being taken to the Markham police station to give a statement as a witness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Discrepancies and Truth Unveiled

During her initial witness statements, police began to notice inconsistencies in Jennifer's story.
*   Her emotional display during the recollection of her mother's death seemed manufactured, as she found her words easily and executed sentences perfectly, unlike someone genuinely distraught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   She hesitated and stuttered when explaining how she made a 911 call with her hands tied behind her back to a banister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.
*   In her second statement, she initially forgot to mention she was tied up before being taken downstairs, which contradicted her previous narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   She contradicted herself regarding which assailant spoke about the purse, initially stating it was the second assailant but then correcting it to the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   She changed her description of Assailant Number Two, from wearing a hoodie to a vest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   She initially claimed to have seen $1,100 taken, but later estimated "a few hundred dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   Her non-verbal cues, such as smiling and then correcting to a solemn stare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>, and her dry tissue during supposed crying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, indicated deception.

Police placed Jennifer under close observation, with a surveillance detail tracking her movements, even at her mother's funeral where she reportedly showed little emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

Crucially, Jennifer's father, Han, awoke from his coma on November 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. He miraculously remembered everything from the incident night and gave an official statement in secret on November 16th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. His account directly contradicted Jennifer's, most significantly stating that she was *never tied up* but was instead walking around freely and talking with the intruders as if they were friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

During her [[Jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | interrogation]] on November 22nd, the detective utilized [[Interrogation_strategies_and_suspect_confession | interrogation strategies and suspect confession]] such as the "how and why solution" and the "futility technique" to pressure Jennifer into confessing her involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>. After over three hours, Jennifer displayed genuine emotion, admitting she was supposed to be the target and not her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. Although she did not explicitly confess to plotting her parents' murder in this interview, her admission to planning the home invasion was enough for her arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>.

The most damning evidence leading to Jennifer's conviction, as well as the conviction of her boyfriend and the intruders, were 116 text messages exchanged between her and her boyfriend in the six hours prior to the murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. These messages detailed how the crime would be carried out and were uncovered by forensics despite their use of burner phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. All involved were found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

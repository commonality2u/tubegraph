[[interrogation_techniques | Passive accusation]] is a specific [[interrogation_techniques | technique]] employed by interrogators, particularly when they are almost certain of a suspect's guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This [[interrogation_techniques_and_strategy | strategy]] involves indirectly accusing the suspect and, in some manner, "indignifying" them, rather than making a direct accusation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Characteristics and Purpose
This technique is made evident through subtle methods, such as offering excessive praise for trivial or mundane actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The implied message is that such basic tasks are noteworthy because the interrogator perceives the suspect as being far worse than the average person.

In one instance, an officer used passive accusation by praising a suspect for simple parental duties like bringing second pairs of clothes, cooking eggs, or giving snacks at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The officer contrasted this by stating, "You're not that kind of guy," implying that some men might consider such tasks a "woman's job," thereby indirectly highlighting perceived shortcomings or unusual behavior in the suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This contrasts with the "reframing technique," which aims to shift a suspect's self-perception from negative to positive to encourage confession by minimizing the perceived severity of their crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

The fatal incident involving Michael Dunn occurred on November 23, 2012, in Jacksonville, Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Michael Dunn, a 45-year-old software developer, was attending his son's wedding with his fiancee, 45-year-old nurse Rhonda Rauer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. After the reception, where both had several alcoholic drinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, they decided to stop at a Gate gas station for a bottle of wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## The Initial Encounter

Upon arriving at the gas station, another vehicle, a red Dodge Durango, pulled in just before them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Michael Dunn opted not to park in an open spot next to the Durango due to loud music coming from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The Durango belonged to 18-year-old Tommy Storms, who was inside the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. His three friends—Leland Brunson, Jordan Davis, and Tevin Thompson—remained in the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

Michael Dunn parked his Volkswagen on the passenger side of the Durango <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Before Rhonda Rauer went into the store, Dunn commented to her, "I hate that thug music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. According to Tevin Thompson, Dunn then told them, "Can you turn the music down, I can't hear myself think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Tevin Thompson complied and turned the music down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Escalation and Conflicting Accounts

Jordan Davis, sitting in the car, then told Tevin to "turn the music back up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. When Tommy Storms returned to the Durango, Tevin turned the music down to inform him of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Michael Dunn then asked, "Are you talking to me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> to which Jordan Davis responded, "Yeah, I'm talking to you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Another witness heard someone yell, "No, you're not gonna talk to me that way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Michael Dunn's [[Discussion of SelfDefense Claims | Self-Defense Claims]]

During his initial [[Witness Testimonies and Police Interrogation | police interrogation]], Dunn claimed that after he asked them to turn the music down and they complied, the music came back on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. He stated that a guy in the back seat became agitated, and while he couldn't hear everything, there was a lot of "cussing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. He then claimed he heard them saying, "kill him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Dunn said he rolled his window down again and asked, "Excuse me, are you talking about me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> followed by "kill that [expletive]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

Crucially, Dunn claimed that Jordan Davis then "goes down on the ground and comes up with something" he thought was a shotgun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Davis allegedly said, "you're dead [expletive]" and opened his door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This, Dunn asserted, made him "scared [expletive] bricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>, leading him to retrieve his pistol from his glove compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. He initially stated he saw a "barrel" coming up on the window, either a "barrel or a stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

### Contradictions from Witnesses and Forensics

Detectives challenged Dunn's narrative regarding the weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>, stating, "there's no weapons in the car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. They emphasized that no stick or weapon was found in or near the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. The victim, Jordan Davis, had no history of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>, and none of the teenagers in the car had criminal track records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. Independent witnesses in the parking lot did not corroborate Dunn's claims of death threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.

During [[Court proceedings and trial statements | court proceedings]], Michael Dunn's lawyer instructed him to emphasize the threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. Dunn stated that he heard "I should kill that [expletive]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a> and that Jordan Davis was "screaming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. He also claimed that after he asked, "Are you talking about me?", Davis picked something up, slammed it against the door, and then said, "yeah, I'm gonna [expletive] kill you" while showing him a gun, specifically a "barrel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. He added that Davis said, "this shit's going down now," a statement not mentioned during his interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>.

Rhonda Rauer's testimony directly contradicted Dunn's claims about a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. She testified that Dunn never told her he saw a gun, weapon of any kind, stick, shotgun, barrel, or lead pipe in the red SUV, either immediately after the shooting or on the drive home the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. Forensic evidence also refuted Dunn's claim that Jordan Davis got out of the truck; the victim remained in the truck, and the door was shut when Dunn opened fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.

## The Shooting

Michael Dunn fired a total of 10 shots into the Durango within three minutes of pulling into the gas station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. The first three shots went through the back passenger side door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. At this point, Tommy Storms put the car in reverse and backed up at full speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The fourth shot missed, while shots 5, 6, and 7 went through the front passenger side door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

As the SUV performed a J-turn to flee, Michael Dunn got out of his car, aimed at the retreating vehicle, and fired three more shots into the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Dunn initially claimed he fired four shots, then four more as they fled, because he believed they had a gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. However, this second volley of shots, fired as the threat was no longer imminent, became a significant legal issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. He admitted during interrogation he was "at a loss to justify" the second volley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

Jordan Davis was struck three times, in the leg, lungs, and heart, causing him to bleed to death in under 45 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. He was 17 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath

Approximately 20 seconds after the gunfire stopped, Rhonda Rauer realized her fiance had fired the shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. She went outside, and Dunn urgently told her to "get in the car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. As they drove away, Rauer asked what happened, and Dunn replied, "I shot at the car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. When she asked why, he stated, "They threatened to kill me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a> and "they started to advance and I reacted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. He also told her he didn't hurt anyone, only shot at the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Rauer kept her thoughts to herself, planning to discuss it in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

They returned to their hotel, where Dunn walked the dog, ordered pizza, and had a rum and coke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. There was almost no conversation between them the entire night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. The next morning, Rhonda Rauer saw news of the shooting, including the red SUV being towed and reports of a death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. She immediately told Dunn they needed to go home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. They drove straight home, with Dunn telling her he loved her during the "horrible trip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## Arrest and Charges

Witnesses at the scene recorded Michael Dunn's license plate, leading police to track him to his home in Brevard County <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. He was brought to the JSO police department for interrogation 22 hours after the shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. During the interrogation, Michael Dunn was charged with murder and attempted murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. He was remanded into custody at the Duval County Jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

The [[Michael Dunn Case Overview | Michael Dunn case]] would proceed to trial, where his [[Discussion of SelfDefense Claims | self-defense claims]] would be a central point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. He was found guilty on three counts of attempted murder on February 15, 2014, receiving a 90-year sentence, and later an additional life sentence without parole for murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.

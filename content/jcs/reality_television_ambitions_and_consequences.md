David Trronis, a 50-year-old stay-at-home husband, desperately wanted to appear on reality television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. In late April 2018, he secured a spot on the show *Zombie House Flipping*, where he was to be featured renovating his newly bought house with his then-wife, 39-year-old financial consultant Shanti Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:21]</a>. However, Shanti was not interested in being on TV and refused to sign off on the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:28]</a>. This refusal led to David beating and strangling her to death in the early hours of the following morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Background

David Trronis and Shanti Cooper met online via Match.com in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:40]</a>. Five months later, David moved to Florida and in with Shanti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:45]</a>. They purchased a house in April 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The house was placed in a trust, with the names of David and his mother, excluding Shanti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:45]</a>. David claimed this was for "planning and financial reasons" and was a mutual decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:49]</a>.

The couple had experienced [[family_dynamics_and_conflict | arguments]] in the past, primarily due to Shanti's work stress, leading to David spending nights at his mother's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:15]</a>. David described these as "irritability" from Shanti, and they would take breaks and later reconcile, becoming "stronger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Reality TV Ambitions and Conflict

David's ambition for reality television centered around *Zombie House Flipping*, a home improvement show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. He believed being on the show would provide "tradeouts" and "promotional sponsorship" for their house renovation, offering higher-end materials like quartz countertops instead of granite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:13:07]</a>. While David initially claimed the show was "just the house" and "they're the stars" (referring to the hosts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:27]</a>, he fully understood he would be featured prominently as the main builder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:33]</a>.

Keith Ary, the producer of *Zombie House Flipping*, stated that David was his primary point of contact and that renovating the house was "Dave's full-time job almost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:53]</a>. However, David did not work in sales or at a chemical company, despite claiming so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:23]</a>; Shanti was the sole source of income for the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

Keith Ary insisted on a formal sit-down meeting with both David and Shanti to ensure Shanti was "fully on board" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:29]</a>. This meeting occurred six days before Shanti's murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:11]</a>. Keith observed that Shanti appeared "unhappy to be there" and was in a "tense state," leaving as soon as she could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:11:07]</a>. This contradicts David's later claims that they were "so happy" and "never been more in love," and that the renovation was "a thing that we did together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

The last argument between David and Shanti, as admitted by David, occurred on Saturday (two days before her death) over the renovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:58]</a>. The disagreement centered on whether to tear out the wavy upstairs floor to create a perfectly flat surface, which would cause further delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:29]</a>.

## The Murder and Investigation

On April 2018, Shanti Cooper was found dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:32]</a>. David called 911 approximately 12 hours after her death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:36]</a>. He claimed he found her unconscious in a partially filled bathtub, bleeding from the nose and mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Interrogation

David was taken to the police station as a witness, where his bloodstained clothing was swapped for a custody suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:10]</a>. He was left alone in an interrogation room for over 4 hours before detectives began their [[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | interrogation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:02:05]</a>. Detectives observed David's suspicious behavior, including his politeness and apologies for basic requests like using the bathroom, and his focus on hunger rather than his wife's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:59]</a>.

Throughout the interrogation, David engaged in what detectives described as "fake cries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:04:02]</a>, "not one tear came out of [his] eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:34]</a>. He described finding Shanti's body with unnerving casualness, even while eating a snack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:19:02]</a>.

Detectives noted several inconsistencies in David's story and physical evidence:
*   Shanti's significant injuries, including a swollen head, black eyes, fractured skull, and intense bruising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:29]</a>, were "more significant than from a soft tissue fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   Her body was deceased before David supposedly left for his walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:50]</a>.
*   Despite claiming to have pulled Shanti out of a bathtub, there was "not a spot of water on the floor" and the carpet was not wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:55]</a>.
*   A single diamond earring on the nightstand suggested she was attacked on the edge of the bed before she could remove the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:58]</a>.

David consistently denied harming Shanti, hitting her, choking her, or strangling her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:14]</a>. He also had no injuries indicating a struggle, apart from scratches from plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:31]</a>. Detectives accused him of killing Shanti, stating, "you fake cried for about seven or eight hours today. Not one tear came out of your eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:34]</a>.

## Legal Proceedings and Outcome

David was left in the interrogation room for over two hours after being told they would bring a polygraph machine, which never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:37]</a>. He eventually asked to go home, cheerfully obliging a photo request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:44]</a>. Four months later, a grand jury indicted him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:52]</a>.

Upon his arrest at his mother's house and being informed of life imprisonment and overwhelming evidence, David "started acting crazy and went for the insanity defense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:30:01]</a>. He spent five years in a maximum-security psychiatric unit before being ruled competent to stand trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:08]</a>.

His trial began on October 12th and lasted six days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:14]</a>. David maintained a plea of not guilty, with his defense arguing an unknown intruder broke in and murdered Shanti while he was out walking the dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:22]</a>. The prosecution argued it was an "intentional killing" and "premeditated design," highlighting the severity of Shanti's beating and strangulation, and the lack of evidence for an intruder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:31:30]</a>.

The jury found David Trronis guilty of first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:13]</a>. Shanti's son, Jackson, delivered a "heart-rending and dignified" victim impact statement, expressing his sorrow and waiting five years for justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:33:45]</a>. David declined to speak prior to [[legal_outcomes_and_sentencing | sentencing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:22]</a>. The court adjudicated him guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:28]</a>. David Trronis is currently housed at the Graceville Correctional Facility in Maximum Security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:40]</a>.

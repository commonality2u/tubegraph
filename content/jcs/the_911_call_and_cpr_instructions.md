On the 911 call, 42-year-old Sarah Boone reported that her boyfriend, 42-year-old George Torres Jr., was dead [00:00:15], [00:01:53]. The 911 operator identified themselves as being from the fire department and instructed Sarah not to hang up [00:00:19]-[00:00:20].

## Sarah's Initial Account

Sarah explained to the 911 operator that she and her boyfriend were playing "kind of hide and seek" the previous night, and she put him in a suitcase [00:00:28]-[00:00:33]. She stated she fell asleep and woke up to find him dead in the suitcase, claiming she didn't know what happened [00:00:35]-[00:00:40]. She confirmed he was in a suitcase and that she had fallen asleep [00:00:47]-[00:00:51].

## CPR Instructions

The 911 operator asked if George was breathing, to which Sarah responded no [00:00:51]-[00:00:53]. The operator then instructed Sarah to get him on the floor and lay him on his back [00:00:53]-[00:00:55], [00:01:02]-[00:01:04]. Sarah claimed she had already tried giving him CPR [00:00:55]-[00:00:57].

The operator provided specific instructions for chest compressions:
*   Place the heel of one hand on his breastbone, in the center of the chest [00:01:09]-[00:01:13], [00:01:21]-[00:01:25].
*   Place the other hand on top of the first hand [00:01:13]-[00:01:16].
*   Pump his chest hard and fast, twice per second [00:01:27]-[00:01:30].

During the call, Sarah reported that George "just gurgled" [00:01:18]-[00:01:21]. Later, she told an officer that air was coming out and he was gurgling when she started doing CPR in the afternoon [00:05:51]-[00:05:57]. She asserted that she knew how to do CPR and was performing it on her own [00:05:58]-[00:06:00].

## Unforeseen Accident Claim

Sarah's explanation to authorities for George's death was that it was a "totally unintentional and unforeseen accident" [00:02:00]-[00:02:04]. She initially told investigators that she zipped George into the suitcase because he thought it would be funny, and she was "gonna joke with you and I'll zip you up make him you know squirm a little bit," but then she fell asleep [00:05:22]-[00:05:31]. She reiterated that they were both laughing about it before she fell asleep [00:05:39]-[00:05:40].

Grant Amato was arrested nine hours after his interrogation at a hotel in Orlando <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

## [[courtroom_proceedings_and_defense_strategies | Trial]]

Grant Amato's [[court_trial_and_sentencing_of_jennifer_pan | trial]] commenced on August 12, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.

### Prosecution's Argument

The prosecution argued that the case revolved around Grant's "blind obsession" with a cam model named Sylvie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. This obsession led to "absolute contempt" for his family, whom he held responsible for his circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>.

A key piece of evidence presented during the [[trial_strategies_and_courtroom_dynamics | trial]] highlighted his actions shortly after the murders:
> "At 2:53 A.M. on January 25th, after leaving the house that contained the three dead bodies of his family, the defendant goes to a nearby Publix parking lot, logs onto their Wi-Fi, and uses his dead brother's USA checking account to pay $599.99 to get on to Sylvie's website at 3:02 in the morning." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>

This act of using his deceased brother's credit card to access a cam site moments after the killings was presented as central to the [[the_crime_details_and_investigation_process | crime details and investigation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.

## [[legal_consequences_of_crime | Sentencing]]

Grant Amato was ultimately sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.

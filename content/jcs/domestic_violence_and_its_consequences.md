Her former boyfriend, George Huguely V, was the primary suspect in her murder, which occurred on May 3, 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00"></a>.

## Background of Individuals and Relationship Dynamics

### Yardley Love
Yardley Love was a 22-year-old sports scholar and a key player on the University of Virginia's lacrosse team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51"></a>. She was captured in a photograph playing in her second-to-last game, a picture that later became a symbol for the "One Love Foundation" founded in her memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05"></a>.

### George Huguely V
George Huguely V, also 22 years old, was Yardley's ex-boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13"></a>. He came from a wealthy American family with roots in the lumber industry dating back to the 1900s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24"></a>. He attended Landon Prep, a prestigious all-boys private school with annual tuition fees of up to $50,000, where he was a star lacrosse player and an All-American athlete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31"></a>. His athletic achievements led to a full scholarship at the University of Virginia, where he continued to be a key player in the starting lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43"></a>.

### Relationship History
George Huguely and Yardley Love dated for almost two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52"></a>. Their relationship was described as "on-again off-again," marked by mutual cheating and frequent temper flares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56"></a>. Yardley ended the relationship in 2010, just two weeks before her graduation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17"></a>. Nine days later, she was found dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21"></a>.

## [[crime_details_and_investigation | The Crime and Investigation]]

### Discovery of the Crime
On May 3, 2010, at approximately 2:15 AM, Yardley's roommate returned to their off-campus apartment to find Yardley's bedroom broken into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26"></a>. Yardley was found unresponsive on her mattress, with blood coming from her nose and severe bruising on the right side of her face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36"></a>. Her friend called 9-1-1 and attempted CPR, which paramedics continued upon arrival, but Yardley was pronounced dead at 2:47 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44"></a>.

### The Investigation
Criminal investigator Lisa Reeves was alerted at 2:53 AM and arrived at Yardley's apartment by 2:59 AM to lead the investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00"></a>. By 3:50 AM, George Huguely V was identified as the first person of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11"></a>.

## [[legal_implications_and_court_proceedings | Interrogation and Confessions]]

Detective Lisa Reeves interviewed George Huguely on May 3, 2010, at 7:52 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20"></a>. George appeared oblivious to the gravity of the situation, seemingly believing he was in minor trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40"></a>. He was advised of his Miranda rights, which he waived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27"></a>.

### George's Account
During the interrogation, George confessed to:
*   Initiating the confrontation with Yardley, stating he went to talk to her about her sleeping with another lacrosse player from North Carolina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01"></a>.
*   "Chok[ing] her a little bit" when she became aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04"></a>.
*   "Wrestling her on the floor" and being "a little bit persistent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42"></a>.
*   Punching a hole through her bedroom door to gain entry, which caused bruising on his hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19"></a>.
*   Grabbing her neck during the "commotion," though he denied strangling her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17"></a>.
*   Taking her laptop "as a collateral" because he was "so pissed that she wouldn't talk to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56"></a>.

He initially claimed Yardley was hitting her head against the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57"></a>, but later struggled to explain how she sustained a "pretty good knot on her head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14"></a>. He denied hitting her with anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28"></a>.

### Revelation of Death
Detectives revealed to George that Yardley was dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:19"></a>. George initially denied knowing, then expressed shock and disbelief, repeatedly saying, "She's not dead" and "I didn't kill her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21"></a>. He speculated that her death might have been due to head trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14"></a>. He asked for a lawyer at 33:55 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55"></a>.

## Trial and Sentencing
George Huguely V pleaded not guilty to murder and was held without bond for almost two years before his trial began on February 6, 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:08"></a>.

### Prosecution's Case
The prosecution argued that Huguely broke into Love's apartment, entered her bedroom, and struck her, causing the blunt force trauma that led to her death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36"></a>. Evidence showed that Huguely exchanged "playful text messages" with three other women late into the night, even after the alleged attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46"></a>.

### Key Testimonies
*   **Michael Burns**: A former UNC lacrosse player testified that he once heard yelling from Huguely's apartment and found Huguely with his arm wrapped around Love's neck, choking her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:22"></a>. Love then ran out crying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37"></a>.
*   **Medical Experts**: Agreed that Love's death resulted from blunt force trauma to the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:42"></a>.
*   **Yardley's Neighbors**: Described hearing loud noises, likening them to a "stereo cabinet crashing to the ground," indicating a violent death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50"></a>.

### Defense's Argument
The defense contended that George Huguely never intended to kill Yardley, arguing it was a "tragic accident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11"></a>. They sought a lesser charge and a second chance, rather than a life sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:18"></a>.

### [[legal_proceedings_and_sentencing | Verdict and Sentence]]
The jury found George Huguely V guilty of second-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:23"></a>. They recommended a 26-year prison term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27"></a>. Judge Edward Hogshire reduced the sentence by three years, resulting in a 23-year prison term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37"></a>. With credit for time served and good behavior, Huguely could be released in 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:06"></a>.

## [[impact_of_the_murder_on_the_families_involved_and_the_trial_outcome | Aftermath and Impact]]

George Huguely was incarcerated at the maximum-security Augusta Correctional Center for 10 years and has since been transferred to a prison Work Camp in Richmond to serve the rest of his sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:25"></a>. The consensus in the media is that while Huguely may not have intended to kill Yardley, his 23-year sentence is appropriate, if not lenient, and his intoxication is not an excuse for his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:37"></a>. He is expected to be released at age 45, affording him a second chance at life that Yardley was denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:52"></a>.

Yardley Love's family stated, "We find no joy in other sorrow. We are relieved to put this chapter behind us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15"></a>. A non-profit organization, the "One Love Foundation," was established in Yardley's memory to spread awareness about social psychology and preventative education concerning relationship violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:04"></a>.

On August 2, 2017, at approximately 5:15 p.m., 21-year-old Savannah Gold left her parents' home and drove to San Jose Boulevard in Jacksonville, Florida, for her 5:30 p.m. shift as a waitress at the Bonefish Grill seafood restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. She never arrived for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Initial Disappearance

Savannah's absence was initially not a major concern for the on-duty supervisor, who simply removed her hours from the roster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Suspicions arose about an hour and 15 minutes after she left home, when her father received a text message from her phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Her older brother received a similar text 43 seconds later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The family immediately recognized that something was wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Savannah had left in high spirits, but the texts claimed she was running away with an unidentified man without packing any clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The messages also contained errors and were written in a style uncharacteristic of Savannah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. When her family tried calling her phone minutes later, it was switched off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. After confirming she hadn't shown up for work, they called the police and filed a missing-persons report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## The Discovery of the Vehicle

Less than two hours after Savannah went missing, her car was found unlocked and abandoned in the Bonefish Grill parking lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The only item missing was her phone; her wallet, ID, and other valuables were left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Surveillance Footage: A Crucial Lead

Investigators reviewed the parking lot surveillance tapes, uncovering what became the primary piece of evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. While most of the footage remains undisclosed, a detailed description has been released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:
*   Savannah parked her car and exited at 5:31 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   She then walked to another vehicle and conversed with its occupant through the driver's side window for 14 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   At 5:45 p.m., she got into the backseat of the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Fourteen seconds later, the car began to shake sporadically, suggesting a struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   The rear door swung open three times but was forcefully shut each time, as if someone was trying to get out but couldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This lasted for 49 seconds until the vehicle stopped moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   A male figure exited the vehicle and walked to Savannah's car, which was 20 feet away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The grainy footage prevented clear identification, but police noted he had short brown hair and was approximately 5 foot 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   The individual reached into Savannah's car, took out what police believed was her phone, and then slashed the front tire with a knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   He returned to his own vehicle and drove away at exactly 6:04 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Savannah was never seen exiting the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Investigators kept this crucial footage secret to prevent a suspect from altering their alibi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Identifying a Suspect: Leroy Daugherty

Over the next two days, investigators briefly interviewed all Bonefish Grill staff, asking about their last contact with Savannah, her whereabouts, and any relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Within 48 hours, they identified three potential suspects whose names were run through the motor insurance database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The third suspect, Leroy Daugherty, 28, matched the description of the 2012 silver Chevy Malibu seen on surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Leroy Daugherty was a manager and head chef at the Bonefish Grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. In his initial interview, he told investigators he hadn't seen Savannah in three weeks and knew nothing of her disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. However, co-workers revealed he had been in an on-and-off relationship with Savannah for eight months, which was against company policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Known for his charm and charisma, Leroy's life seemed successful, yet he was now the prime suspect in a kidnapping investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## The Interrogation

On August 5, at around 5:15 p.m., police arrested Leroy Daugherty during his shift, ostensibly for an outstanding traffic warrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. He was taken to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Police Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Leroy was left alone for 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The arrival of Detective Rae Reeves, who had interviewed him about Savannah the day before, immediately signaled the severity of his situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

The detective began with open-ended questions about Savannah, to which Leroy gave a lengthy and detailed response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. He admitted to taking an Adderall given to him by a friend that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. He described his on-and-off relationship with Savannah, mentioning they connected over similar backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. He claimed their relationship ended because Savannah started using drugs, including heroin, heavily, which scared him due to his mother's past methamphetamine addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. He stated their last contact was a text conversation about three weeks prior, in July, where they mutually agreed to stop talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

When confronted about the last time he saw her, Leroy admitted he hadn't told the truth earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. He then amended his alibi, stating he last saw her on Wednesday afternoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. He claimed Savannah was spreading rumors at work about their sexual relationship, which jeopardized his job as a manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. He recounted confronting her in the parking lot, where she claimed she was "a little paranoid" from having just done heroin and asked to sit in his car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. He told her to stop talking about their relationship, to which she allegedly responded angrily and said she would continue spreading lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

Leroy then falsely claimed Savannah got out of his car with her phone and walked towards the main entrance, eventually getting into an "older model Ford pickup green" that drove past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. He maintained he had no further contact with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Detectives feigned belief in his story to allow him to lower his guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

A confrontation about a neck injury Leroy had sustained, which he claimed was self-inflicted from July, was questioned by the female detective as an "unusual place for a self-inflicted injury" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

The detectives escalated the confrontation, directly accusing Leroy of involvement in Savannah's disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. They appealed to his morality, emphasizing the family's need for closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. When he maintained his alibi, the female detective revealed the definitive proof: "She never got out of your car... Video cameras don't lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

Under pressure, Leroy continued to deny involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. The detectives suggested an overdose scenario to minimize his actions, but he did not initially accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. They relentlessly continued, eventually leading to a breakthrough where Leroy admitted he took Savannah to his house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. The footage of the interrogation cuts off at the moment of his full confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

## Confession and Aftermath

Leroy Dougherty admitted to killing Savannah Gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. He claimed he broke her neck, then took her body back to his house, burned it in a self-made fire pit, and dumped her remains in a lake at the end of a secluded road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. Savannah's body had injuries to over 75 percent of her body, and the medical examiner could not pinpoint the exact cause of death, concluding it was a violent homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

Footage released by the JSO from moments after the confession shows Leroy experiencing profound emotional distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

## Legal Proceedings

Leroy was remanded into custody at the Duval County Jail and denied bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Despite overwhelming evidence and the prospect of life in prison without parole, he pleaded not guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. He claimed Savannah's killing was an act of self-defense, alleging he feared for his life after she slapped him multiple times, at which point he grabbed her neck, felt a "pop," and accidentally broke it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. This claim was made despite his height of 5 foot 11 and weight of 163 pounds, compared to Savannah's 5 feet tall and 91 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. The state's attorney's office made no comment on this motion, stating only that the trial was expected to commence in the summer of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.

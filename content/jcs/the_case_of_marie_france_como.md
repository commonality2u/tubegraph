Corporal Marie France Como, a 37-year-old military traffic technician stationed at CFB Trenton, was found murdered in her home in Brighton in November 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. It was believed there was a sexual component to her crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>, and she was raped and suffocated to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Colonel Russell Williams became the prime suspect for this infraction at the time of his interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

## Initial Awareness of the Crime

Colonel Russell Williams stated he learned of Marie France Como's death via an email sent by the staff at the base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. He recalled seeing the email first thing in the morning after returning from meetings in Ottawa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. He had only met her once, shortly after he arrived at the base, when she was on a crew he was also on, likely in August or September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.

During his interrogation, when asked about his schedule around the time of the message, he repeatedly stated he could not remember the specific day of the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.

## Evidence and Interrogation Strategy

In the interrogation, Detective Sergeant Jim Smith falsely stated that DNA found on [[the_investigation_into_jessica_lloyds_disappearance | Marie France Como]]'s body would be matched to Russell Williams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>. This was a deceptive tactic, as the DNA found on her body was not admissible due to its highly decomposed state, making genetic analysis virtually impossible before the era of next-generation sequencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>.

> "Marie France Como <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>. There was an open window in the basement of her house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>. When she was away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:14:00">[35:14:00]</a>, I went in there a couple of nights before she came home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:17:00">[35:17:00]</a>. She came home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:23:00">[35:23:00]</a>, looked around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:23:00">[35:23:00]</a>. I went back in there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:24:00">[35:24:00]</a> late at night when she was at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:26:00">[35:26:00]</a>. She was on the phone in her bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:29:00">[35:29:00]</a>. She actually discovered me in the basement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>. She was trying to get her cat to come upstairs and the cat was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a> in the basement that seen me and was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a> fixated on me in the corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:00">[35:43:00]</a>. She couldn't get the cat up so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:45:00">[35:45:00]</a> she came downstairs trying to get the cat and <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:49:00">[35:49:00]</a> I'm not sure why she <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:00">[35:53:00]</a> came over to me I guess the cat was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:56:00">[35:56:00]</a> staring at me and she was wondering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:57:00">[35:57:00]</a> where the cat was staring at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>. So when she spotted me I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a> had the same flashlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>. I subdued her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>, tied her up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:19:00">[36:19:00]</a>, not upstairs and <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:20:00">[36:20:00]</a> strangled her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:20:00">[36:20:00]</a> later in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:35:00">[36:35:00]</a>."

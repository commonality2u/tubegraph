Evaluating information with the benefit of hindsight provides a considerable advantage, as knowing a subject is guilty allows for an exclusive focus on perceived guilty behavior, highlighting imperatives while stripping away non-essentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, hindsight also applies to the innocent, often revealing straightforward behavior once misdirection and trickery are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While individual reactions vary and trauma can cause atypical behavior, such behavior is generally distinguishable from guilty behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. [[Cognitive bias in evaluating guilt | The knowledge of outcome]] can highlight certain aspects that might otherwise be overlooked due to doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Case Study: Michael Dixon

Michael Dixon, 37, described as popular, friendly, unassuming, and reserved, was a self-professed introvert who turned down a presenter job due to public speaking fear, opting to remain a trade show assembler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Circumstances of Arrest and Interrogation

On August 15, 2003, in Hamilton, Ontario, police responding to a jewelry store break-in chased a perpetrator and momentarily lost sight of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Michael Dixon, getting off a bus nearby after work, was the first person police saw coming out of the alley and was arrested at gunpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. He voiced his innocence and offered to help, not resisting arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Two hours later, he was questioned at the Hamilton police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. A policing misstep was noted: the 9-1-1 call described the suspect as a "small white man," but Dixon is 6'3" and not white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The detective either forgot to review the call or rejected it as evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Despite being read his rights and informed of the recording, Michael asserted his willingness to speak and help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The detective immediately stated that Dixon's innocence or guilt was "not an issue" as the evidence was "conclusive and overwhelming," and he would not ask if Dixon committed the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Instead, he wanted to ascertain "what kind of guy" Dixon was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This approach is an example of [[passive_accusation_in_interrogations | passive accusation in interrogations]].

Michael maintained a forward-leaning posture and kept consistent eye contact at the same level as the detective, displaying self-confidence and poise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This behavior, known as a non-verbal challenge in forensic psychology, asserted dominance in the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The detective, conversely, exhibited a nervous disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Despite being accused, Michael was incredibly tolerant of the injustice, which was an unusual anomaly for an innocent subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. He continued to profess his innocence calmly for seven minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. When confronted with the "conclusive" video evidence, which didn't make sense to him given his innocence, he decided he had no choice but to get a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. The fear emerged in his eyes as he realized he wouldn't be going home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. He maintained his composure, asking if the video camera claim was a bluff to see his reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Michael was asked to draw a map of his movements before the arrest, and every detail of his alibi was later proven 100% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. The detective assured him of a thorough investigation to find the "true version of events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### [[Legal Outcomes and Sentencing | Legal Outcomes]]

Michael was kept in jail for three and a half days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. A separate investigator later looked into his alibi witnesses and checked surveillance footage, leading to his immediate exoneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. A civil trial followed, and Michael was awarded $46,000 in punitive damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. The interrogating officer and three other investigators were demoted and suspended without pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

## Case Study: Justin

Justin, 26, was falsely accused of breaking and entering, first-degree theft, and assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. He was arrested at home and only read his rights on the way to the police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. He was unaware he would be wrongfully imprisoned for just over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Interrogation and Reaction

Initially, Justin viewed the interrogators as an inconvenience rather than a threat, giving short, concise responses without seeking approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. His alibi for the time of the alleged break-in was being at his mother's house, asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The detective's strategy was to reveal the charges periodically, starting with the break-in and robbery, then later the assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The accuser, "Candy," claimed she saw Justin loitering and then breaking in, stealing items, and later picked him from a 12-picture lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Upon learning of the burglary charge, which carried a possible 20-year sentence due to prior convictions, Justin forcefully asserted his innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. His posture became more forward, and his vocal emphasis strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. He vehemently denied knowing "Candy," stating he didn't break into her house and had been home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. He mentioned Candy's ex-boyfriend, Tim Stark, who was the accuser's ex-boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

When accused of assaulting the victim during the robbery, Justin became highly combative and aggressive in a defensive manner, cursing and vehemently denying the accusation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. He pointed out that Candy's boyfriend, Tim Stark, might be responsible for her injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Having previously served three years for robbery in his early twenties, Justin likely recognized the gravity of the situation despite the investigator's reassuring tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. His anger and combative stance were deemed justified given the potential for significant prison time for a crime he didn't commit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This contrasts sharply with Michael Dixon's forgiving composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This is an example of [[emotional_responses_in_criminal_investigations | emotional responses in criminal investigations]].

### [[The investigation and trial outcomes | Trial Outcomes]]

The accuser's testimony was later discredited in court, as she was caught lying multiple times on the stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Justin was exonerated, his innocence proven "essentially beyond all doubt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

The case of [[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer Pan]] is notable in the true crime genre due to the extensive amount of raw footage publicly available, providing over 11 hours of material that details her life and offers insight into her psychological state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article condenses the lead-up to her extraordinary story, which [[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer]] herself will narrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Early Life and Upbringing

[[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer Pan]] was born and raised in Markham, Ontario, within a middle-class household, alongside her older brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Her parents, Beak and Han, were originally from Vietnam, and their parenting style was described as very strict, even authoritarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. They viewed success and achievement from their children as outright obligations, whether in academics or extracurricular activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Some might argue that these high expectations took precedence over the children's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Figure Skating Ambitions and Injury

Initially, [[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer]] embraced the pressure placed upon her and dedicated herself to figure skating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. She displayed exceptional talent and was once expected to compete in the Winter Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. However, at the age of 14, she suffered a serious knee injury, ending her dreams of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Of greater concern was that her parents' expectations now had to be met through a more traditional path: education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Academic Struggles and Extensive Deception

[[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer]] was not as academically gifted as she was athletic, averaging a C-minus when her parents demanded straight A's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Instead of communicating with them, she began faking her test results to meet their expectations under false pretenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This deception escalated to faking end-of-year report cards, a high school diploma, and even a university acceptance letter to study pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. In her parents' perception, she was on her way to a noble and well-paid career in medical healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The reality was that she was a high school dropout living with her drug dealer boyfriend, a relationship she had kept secret for nearly eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

[[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer]] explained that her preferred career choice was a piano teacher, along with a simple lab technician job, which was at odds with her parents' desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>. She eventually recounted buying a fake diploma for five hundred dollars to show her parents and going to many other lengths to maintain the lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.

> [!note] Parental Expectations and Pressure
> [[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer]] felt it was "pretty tough to live up to their expectations," as her dad wanted her to be a doctor, which were "pretty high standards for anybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>. She felt they compared her to classmates and clubmates who had been successful, telling her "you could have been that person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. She stated she had heard this her "whole life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

## Discovery and Ultimatum

In 2010, at 24 years old, [[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer's]] double life was discovered by her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This happened when her mother called a friend [[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer]] claimed to be staying with, and the friend, groggy, accidentally revealed [[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer]] wasn't home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>. She was given an ultimatum:
*   **Option 1**: Live at home under a strict regime, cease all contact with her boyfriend, and only leave the house to pursue an education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Option 2**: Do whatever she wanted, but be disowned from her [[Family dynamics and conflict | family]], never return home, and lose all financial support immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

[[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer]] initially chose to stay with her [[Family dynamics and conflict | family]], despite feeling "trapped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. She explained there was "no choice" because "family was number one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>.

## Secret Relationship and Its Impact

[[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer]] had been dating her boyfriend, Daniel, in secret for almost eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Her parents disliked the fact that he was of mixed race and told her to stop seeing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. When told to end the relationship, [[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer]] felt "empty" and depressed, like a part of her was missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. She continued the relationship in secret, which became increasingly difficult to hide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. She even lived with Daniel at his parents' house for two years, while her own parents believed she was attending university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.

> [!info] Feeling Trapped
> [[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer]] described feeling "trapped" under the strict guidelines implemented by her parents for the 18 months prior to the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.

## Planning the Home Invasion

[[jennifers_interrogation_and_confession | Jennifer]] decided that neither of the options given by her parents would suffice, so she devised "option number three" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. She had her boyfriend arrange a mock home invasion where three acquaintances would enter the Pan household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The instructions were to ransack the home and murder her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The planned date was Monday, November 8th, at approximately 11 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

In October 2023, the trial for David Tronis began, culminating in his conviction for first-degree murder in the death of his wife, Shanti Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.

## Background

David Tronis, 50, a stay-at-home husband, reportedly wanted to appear on reality television, specifically the show *Zombie House Flipping*, where he would be featured renovating a newly bought house with his then-wife, 39-year-old financial consultant Shanti Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Shanti, however, was not interested and refused to sign off on the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This refusal led to David beating and strangling her to death in late April 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. He called 911 approximately 12 hours later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Initial Police Contact and Interrogation

Upon police arrival, Tronis was found performing CPR on Shanti in the living room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He claimed he found her unconscious in a partially filled bathtub, bleeding from the nose and mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. He was taken to the police station as a witness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Detectives noted his suspicious behavior, such as being overly polite and apologetic when asking to use the bathroom after being left alone for over four hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

During the [[david_tronis_and_shanti_cooper_murder_case#The Interrogation|interrogation]], David was observed to have 11 "fake cries" which diminished as the detective made it obvious she knew he was lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. He denied any physical altercations with Shanti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Detectives informed him that Shanti's injuries were significant and inconsistent with a fall, stating their belief she was deceased before he left the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. David maintained he told them "everything" and denied harming her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. He also had no injuries aside from plant scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. The detective challenged him directly, accusing him of fake crying and showing no remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

## Indictment and Pre-Trial

Four months after the murder, a grand jury indicted David Tronis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. He was arrested at his mother's house and, upon learning he faced life imprisonment and overwhelming evidence, he attempted an insanity defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. He spent five years in a maximum-security psychiatric unit before a judge ruled him competent to stand trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

## The Trial

David's trial began on October 12, 2023, and lasted six days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. He maintained a plea of not guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

### Defense Arguments

The defense's official stance was that David was walking the dogs when an unknown intruder broke into the house and murdered Shanti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. They emphasized Shanti's role as the sole income provider and David's stay-at-home status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. The defense claimed the prosecution's case was based on circumstantial evidence, pure supposition, and a "hunch" by Detective Sprag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>, who allegedly prejudged the case based on a phone call about David's "crocodile tears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. They accused the detectives of a "rush to judgment" and "confirmational bias," and argued that David had "bared his soul" for 16 hours during the interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.

### Prosecution Arguments

The prosecution argued that it was an intentional killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. They highlighted the unusual living arrangement, where David slept in the garage with dogs while Shanti stayed in a separate apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. They contended that a random stranger would not take the time to strangle someone, move the body to a tub, take nothing, and leave no signs or DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. The prosecution presented evidence of Shanti's severe injuries, including a fractured skull, swollen eyes, and intense bruising and bleeding around her mouth, indicating a brutal beating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. They asserted that David intended to cause death with premeditation and asked the jury to convict him of first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.

## Verdict and Sentencing

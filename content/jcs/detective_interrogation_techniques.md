Effective [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation techniques]] are crucial in [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | criminal investigation]] and can involve detailed planning, psychological strategies, and careful observation of a suspect's verbal and non-verbal cues. The interrogation of Stephanie Lazarus demonstrates several of these methods.

## Preparation and Strategy
Detectives meticulously prepared for Stephanie Lazarus's interview, more so than for any previous case, knowing they were dealing with a fellow law enforcement officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Their strategy included:
*   **Creating a Ruse** – Lazarus was invited under the pretense of advising on an art theft case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Maintaining a Casual Tone** – The initial plan was to keep the conversation as casual as possible for as long as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Strategic Confrontation** – Detectives carefully waited for key moments to initiate the confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Setting the Scene and Tone
To manage the suspect's perception and behavior, [[police_interrogation_strategies | police interrogation strategies]] often involve manipulating the environment and initial interactions:
*   **Compatible Tone** – Detectives established a friendly and compatible tone with Lazarus immediately upon her entering the interrogation room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This aimed to negate the negative implications of the [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation]] environment through a friendly disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Concealed Motives for Location** – The stated reason for meeting in an unusual location (the interrogation room) was to avoid spreading rumors or innuendo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The actual reason was to ensure Lazarus would check in her firearm before entering the area, without arousing suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This established a false perception that detectives were on her side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Psychological Tactics and Observation

Detectives employ [[psychological_techniques_in_suspect_interviews | psychological techniques in suspect interviews]] and keen observation to identify deception:
*   **Mispronunciation Test** – The investigators intentionally mispronounced John Ruetten's name, a crucial figure in the case, to observe Stephanie's reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   **Observation**: Stephanie's pause was four times longer than it should have been, indicating deception as she feigned not having thought about the name for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Identifying Omission** – Although not directly asked, a truthful subject would typically volunteer information about a significant past relationship, such as dating for four years and going on holidays together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Lazarus omitted these details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Recognizing Fight or Flight** – When John Ruetten's wife was mentioned, Stephanie likely experienced a psychological fight or flight reaction, triggered by an influx of hormones preparing her to confront or escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. She chose to "fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Verbal Indicators of Deception** – The use of exclamatory remarks like "gosh," "god," and "jeezy" was identified as a continuous attempt by the suspect to insinuate a vague memory due to a lack of contemplation on the subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. She tried to convey she had no reason to think about John or anything related to him for two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Confrontation and Naivety** – Guilty suspects often act naive to blatant confrontations to avoid them, while truthful subjects address them directly or seek clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Stephanie, as a police officer for 25 years, knew acting oblivious would be a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Subtle Evasion and Reassurance** – Detectives subtly avoided Stephanie's direct challenges by offering deceptively reassuring responses, diverting her focus back to the false premise of privacy and confidentiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Terror Management Theory (TMT)** – Stephanie exhibited hyper-arousal and a derivative of TMT, over-explaining trivial matters and going off on unrelated tangents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This is believed to be a subconscious coping mechanism for momentary relief from the terrifying reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Increasing Pressure** – When Stephanie challenged the detectives a second time, they avoided her question but maintained the topic without offering reassurance, subtly increasing the pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Facial Expression Analysis** – Detectives observed changes in Stephanie's facial expressions, noting when she was genuinely reflecting versus pretending to think about answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Unmitigated Terror** – When Stephanie verbalized the victim's death, her face displayed "unmitigated terror," a significant non-verbal cue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   **Disposition Shifts** – Her disposition shifted from passive (truthful) when discussing John's apartment location to frantic (vague memory) when asked where he moved after marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

## Confrontation and Miranda Warning
Eventually, the detectives progressed to a direct confrontation:
*   **Suspect Recognition of Interrogation** – Stephanie recognized she was a suspect and that it was an [[investigation_tactics_and_police_interrogation | interrogation]], expressing concern and the need for a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Request for DNA** – Detectives directly asked for a DNA swab, stating their job was to "identify and eliminate" suspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Miranda Rights** – Stephanie Lazarus was read her Miranda rights, and she immediately chose to remain silent and speak to a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

Stephanie Lazarus was later found guilty of first-degree murder of Sherri Rasmussen and sentenced to 27 years to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.

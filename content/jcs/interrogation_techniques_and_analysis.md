[[interrogation_techniques_and_strategies | Interrogation analysis]] involves evaluating information, with the benefit of hindsight providing a considerable advantage, especially when the subject's guilt is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Knowledge of the outcome highlights imperatives and strips away non-essentials, allowing for calculations that might otherwise be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Hindsight in Interrogation Analysis

The aphorism "hindsight is 20/20" is well-known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This concept is particularly compatible with innocent subjects because the information to scrutinize is reduced, as versatile factors of misdirection and trickery are removed, leaving relatively straightforward behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. While individuals are unique and exceptions exist (especially considering trauma can cause atypical behavior), atypical behavior is generally distinguished from guilty behavior with relative ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Case Study: Michael Dixon

### Background and Arrest

Michael Dixon, a 37-year-old self-professed introvert, was described by peers as popular, friendly, unassuming, and reserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He turned down a job as a trade show presenter due to fear of public speaking, retaining his position as a trade show assembler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

On August 15, 2003, in Hamilton, Ontario, police responded to a jewelry store break-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Officers chased the perpetrator but momentarily lost sight of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. At the same time, Michael Dixon was getting off a bus nearby, returning from work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. He was the first person police saw coming out of the alley and was arrested at gunpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Dixon voiced his innocence but did not resist arrest, stating he would help in any way he could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He was taken to the Hamilton police station and questioned two hours after his arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

A policing misstep occurred as the 9-1-1 caller described the suspect as a "small white man," but Dixon is 6'3" and not white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The [[detective_interrogation_techniques | detective]] either forgot standard procedure to review the call or rejected it as evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Michael was informed the room was recorded and read his rights, asserting willingness to speak with the [[detective_interrogation_techniques | detective]] and help with the investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Detective's Approach and Michael's Response

The [[detective_interrogation_techniques | detective]] immediately stated that Dixon's innocence or guilt was not an issue, as the evidence was "conclusive and overwhelming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The detective intended to ascertain "what kind of guy" Michael was, whether a "serial burglar" or if it was a "one-off thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Michael maintained a forward-leaning posture and kept his eyes at the same level as the [[detective_interrogation_techniques | detective]], displaying self-confidence and poise, while the [[detective_interrogation_techniques | detective]] appeared nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This behavior is a "non-verbal challenge" in [[psychological_techniques_in_suspect_interviews | forensic psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Michael's exaggerated head movement, which followed the [[detective_interrogation_techniques | detective]]'s eye-contact break, was to assert dominance, letting the [[detective_interrogation_techniques | detective]] know he was maintaining eye contact and was the more confident person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Michael acknowledged the [[detective_interrogation_techniques | detective]]'s position but consistently stated, "I didn't do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. He remained incredibly tolerant of the injustice, which the narrator described as unusual for an innocent subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. When the [[detective_interrogation_techniques | detective]] claimed there were witnesses and a video camera, Michael pointed out that if he were on camera, it "doesn't make sense" to him, as he knew he didn't commit the act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. He suggested he had "no choice but to get a lawyer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Michael's fear emerged when he realized he wouldn't be going home, but he reacted with reasoning and intuitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. He questioned if the [[detective_interrogation_techniques | detective]] was making up the video camera claim to see his reaction, effectively "calling your bluff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. He continued to profess innocence calmly for another seven minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. He was then asked to draw a map and specify his movements before the arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

### Outcome

Every detail of Michael's alibi was later proven 100% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. He was kept in jail for three and a half days before a separate investigator looked into his alibi, witnesses, and surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Michael was then immediately exonerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. A civil trial ensued, and he was awarded $46,000 in punitive damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. The interrogating officer and three other investigators were demoted and suspended without pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

## Case Study: Justin (Comparison)

To contrast Michael Dixon's composure, a common response from an innocent subject facing similar charges was shown through the case of 26-year-old Justin, falsely accused of breaking and entering, first-degree theft, and assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Justin was arrested at home and read his rights to silence on the way to the police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. He was unaware he would be wrongfully imprisoned for over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Detective's Strategy and Justin's Reaction

The [[detective_interrogation_techniques | detective]]'s [[interrogation_techniques | strategy]] was to reveal charges periodically, believing it easier to get a confession to one charge at a time rather than all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The plan was to reveal the break-in and robbery charge first, then the assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Initially, Justin saw the interrogators as an inconvenience rather than a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. His responses were short and concise, not seeking approval, only responding to questions or stating a point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Upon learning of the burglary charge, which carried a possible 20-year prison sentence due to previous convictions, Justin began to forcefully assert his innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Each assertion brought forward his posture and strengthened his vocal emphasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. He vehemently denied knowing the accuser, "Candy," and mentioned her ex-boyfriend, Tim Stark, who was later revealed to be the accuser's ex-boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. When accused of assault, Justin aggressively denied it and suggested questioning Tim Stark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Having previously served three years for a robbery, Justin likely knew the reassuring tone of the investigator wasn't a good sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. His aggressive yet defensive form of aggression is a commonplace response from innocent individuals being directly accused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This combative conduct is considered justified when facing significant prison time for something one didn't do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

### Outcome

The accuser's testimony was later picked apart in court, as she was caught lying multiple times on the stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Justin was exonerated, proven innocent "beyond all doubt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## Distinguishing Innocent and Guilty Behavior

Comparing Justin's combative yet justified anger to Michael Dixon's forgiving composure highlights the extraordinary nature of Michael's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. While both were innocent and falsely accused, their reactions to similar circumstances varied significantly, yet both consistently maintained their innocence.

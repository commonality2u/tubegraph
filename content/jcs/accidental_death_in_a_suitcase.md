On the night of the incident, Sarah Boone and George Torres Jr., both 42 years old, were at home, drinking wine, doing puzzles, and listening to music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

### 911 Call
Sarah Boone called 911, reporting that her boyfriend was dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. She explained to the dispatcher that she and George were playing hide and seek, and she put him in a suitcase. She then fell asleep and woke up to find him dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

## Investigation
Upon arrival, officers found George Torres Jr. dead from suffocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Sarah's initial explanation was that his death was a completely unintentional and unforeseen accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

### Evidence from Sarah's Phone
Investigators discovered two videos on Sarah's phone recorded the night before George's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **First Video:** Taken at 11:12 PM, it shows Sarah laughing at George while he is zipped up in the suitcase. George can be heard asking to be let out and repeatedly stating that he cannot breathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Second Video:** Recorded 11 minutes later, it shows the same scene, but the suitcase has been flipped over and moved to a different area of the apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Sarah is visibly and heavily intoxicated in these videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

Sarah initially claimed no memory of these videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35:00">[29:35:00]</a>. When confronted with the footage, she stated that the remarks made in the video were part of their usual interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>.

### Forensic Findings on George's Body
The autopsy revealed that George sustained injuries on his left shoulder, a cut near his lip, a contusion on his neck, and bruising on the left side of his forehead and skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. Forensics confirmed these injuries occurred the night he died and were not present before he entered the apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. Sarah denied causing these injuries, suggesting he might have fallen off her son's bike or run into a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.

### Sarah's Account vs. Evidence
Sarah maintained that the incident was accidental and that she did not intentionally leave George in the suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:00">[22:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[25:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:27:00">[30:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. She stated she thought leaving the suitcase unzipped would be enough for him to get out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>. She also claimed she thought he was "okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:27:00">[27:27:00]</a>. However, the videos show George repeatedly stating he couldn't breathe, and Sarah responding with derogatory comments and laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>.

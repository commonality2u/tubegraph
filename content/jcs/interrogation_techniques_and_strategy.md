Interrogations involve specific strategies and techniques used by detectives to elicit information and potentially confessions from suspects, while suspects often attempt to control the narrative.

## Interrogation Process and Initial Strategy
Michael Dunn was subjected to interrogation 22 hours after a shooting incident, commencing at 4 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Prior to questioning, he was read his Miranda rights, including the right to stop answering questions and consult with a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

At the outset, detectives consider the suspect's likely mindset and the role they aim to portray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. In Dunn's case, he sought to appear as a victim who had no other choice, aiming to seem rational, reasonable, and considerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Knowing someone had died, he felt the need to distort facts and perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Initially, detectives adopt a neutral stance to encourage the suspect to divulge as much information as possible before legal counsel is requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. They may appear to agree with the suspect to encourage disclosure, as challenging them too early could lead them to shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

## Escalation of Pressure
Once a baseline narrative is established, investigators gradually increase pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This involves destabilizing the suspect's thought process by inducing anxiety and setting traps for self-incrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. The goal is to make the suspect panic, leading to more calculated questions, but the approach must be subtle to avoid frightening them into silence or requesting a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

Detectives use several methods to challenge the suspect's story:
*   **Challenging post-incident behavior**: For example, questioning why Dunn ordered pizza instead of calling the police from his hotel room if he genuinely feared for his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This was contrasted with another case where a person immediately called 911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
*   **Disproving claims with evidence**: The absence of a weapon in the victim's car was a major issue for Dunn's self-defense claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.
*   **Highlighting inconsistencies**: Dunn's description of seeing a "shotgun" changed to a weak and unconvincing claim of seeing a "barrel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
*   **Pointing out illogical actions**: If Dunn truly believed the victims had a shotgun, why would he get out of his car, making himself an easier target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>?
*   **Corroboration from other witnesses**: Other occupants of the victim's vehicle stated they did not threaten to kill Dunn, only exchanged insults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. Independent witnesses in the parking lot also did not corroborate Dunn's claims of threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.
*   **Forensic evidence**: Forensics refuted Dunn's claim that the victim exited the truck, showing the victim was hit while still inside with the door shut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.
*   **Victim's background**: The victim had no history of violence, making the death threat claim less credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

## Suspect Behavior During Interrogation
Dunn frequently reverted to claiming he was in "fear for his life" and "reacted" instinctively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. He attempted to justify his actions by stating he was "scared" and did not "have time to think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. He also tried to appear appealing by showing emotion when discussing his fiancee and dog, implying selflessness and nobility, but showed no emotion when describing taking a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.

His claims were undermined by inconsistencies, such as his fiancee stating he never mentioned seeing a gun or weapon of any kind on the night of the incident or the following morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>.

## Outcome
Michael Dunn was found guilty on three counts of attempted murder and was sentenced to 90 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. Seven months later, he received an additional life sentence without parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>. The jury had access to his interrogation, where his initial responses contradicted his later, more forcefully delivered testimony prepared with his lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

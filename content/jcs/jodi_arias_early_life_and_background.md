Jodi Ann Arias was born on Wednesday, July 9, 1980, at exactly 11:54 p.m. in Salinas, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Unbeknownst to her parents, she was "destined to become one of the most infamous people in the United States of America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Childhood and Education

Despite what her [[jodi_ariass_defense_and_trial_proceedings | defense team]] would later claim, there is "virtually nothing in Jodi's childhood that can be linked as a contributing factor" to her later actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The only notable detail from her early life is that she dropped out of high school in the 11th grade to pursue a career in photography, which ultimately "went nowhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Early Adulthood and Meeting Travis Alexander

In February 2006, at 26 years of age, Jodi began a new job as a salesperson for a network marketing company called Pre-Paid Legal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It was through this occupation that she met [[relationship_dynamics_between_jodi_arias_and_travis_alexander | Travis Alexander]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. [[relationship_dynamics_between_jodi_arias_and_travis_alexander | Travis Alexander]] was a 28-year-old practicing Mormon from Arizona, who also worked part-time as a motivational speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. They initially crossed paths at a business conference in September 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

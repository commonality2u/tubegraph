The case of Tori Stafford garnered significant public and media attention from its earliest stages, with police making a public appeal for information on the unidentified woman seen with Tori <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Tori's grandparents offered a $10,000 reward for her return, and a Facebook group dedicated to finding her quickly amassed over 20,000 followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. Four days after her disappearance, hundreds gathered for a vigil in Woodstock, Ontario, and Tori's mother made a tearful televised appeal for her daughter's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

During the interrogation of Michael Rafferty, the detective highlighted the extensive media coverage the case would receive, comparing it to the high-profile [[impact_and_aftermath_of_the_jodi_arias_case | Paul Bernardo]] case, anticipating a "frenzy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>. He also noted that Tori's parents, Rodney Stafford and Tara McDonald, would want to know "why" the crime occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.

Before the verdict, family members sensed an "excitement" due to the quick deliberations (just over a day), which made them "truly believe" it would be a guilty verdict.

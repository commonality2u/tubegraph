The legal proceedings following the shooting incident involving Michael Dunn culminated in his conviction and sentencing for murder and attempted murder. The investigation highlighted inconsistencies in Dunn's account compared to witness statements and forensic evidence, ultimately leading to a guilty verdict.

## Arrest and Initial Interrogation
Witnesses at the scene of the shooting recorded Michael Dunn's license plate, allowing police to track him down at his home in Brevard County <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. He was brought to the JSO police department without incident and subjected to interrogation starting at 4 PM, 22 hours after the shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

During the interrogation, Dunn was advised of his rights, including the right to stop answering questions and consult with a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. He signed a document acknowledging he understood these rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

### Michael Dunn's Claims During Interrogation
Dunn attempted to portray himself as a [[consequences_of_wrongful_accusations | victim]] who had no choice but to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. He claimed he asked the individuals in the SUV to turn down their music politely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, and after they complied, the music came back on, and the situation escalated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. He stated he heard them saying "kill him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a> and "kill that f***er" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

Crucially, Dunn claimed he saw one of the individuals go down and come up with what he thought was a shotgun, saying "you're dead f***er" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. He reiterated this, stating he "f***ing bricks" and then reached for his pistol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. He initially stated he shot four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, then four more times as the vehicle was fleeing because he "was still scared" and believed they had a gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. He also claimed he got out of his car and fired three more shots into the back of the retreating vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Dunn maintained his actions were in [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_claims | self-defense]] due to perceived threats and a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

### Interrogation Tactics and Discrepancies
The detectives utilized subtle tactics to encourage disclosure, initially appearing neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. They later began to destabilize his thought process by inducing anxiety and setting "traps" for him to incriminate himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

Detectives pointed out several discrepancies and inconsistencies in Dunn's story:
*   **Failure to report to police immediately:** They questioned why he ordered pizza at his hotel rather than calling the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, especially given his claim of being in fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. They contrasted his actions with a previous case where a person in a similar incident immediately called 9-1-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Absence of a weapon:** The biggest hurdle was the lack of any weapon in the victim's truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. Dunn's description of seeing a "shotgun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a> changed to a "barrel or a stick" during the interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. His emphasis on the weapon's presence was weak and unconvincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
*   **Shooting at a retreating vehicle:** The detectives highlighted that the last set of rounds fired when the truck was backing away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a> constituted an "issue" because the vehicle was "no longer a threat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.
*   **Dunn exiting his car:** They questioned why he would exit his car, exposing himself, if he believed the occupants of the other car had a shotgun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.
*   **Victim's position:** Forensic evidence refuted Dunn's claim that the victim was getting out of the truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. Three bullets went through the door, indicating the victim was still inside the truck when hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.
*   **Lack of corroborating witnesses:** No independent witnesses or other occupants of the SUV corroborated Dunn's claim of being threatened with death or a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. The victim had no history of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.
*   **Fiancee's testimony:** Rhonda Rauer, Dunn's fiancee, testified that Dunn never mentioned seeing a gun or any weapon in the red SUV, either at the gas station, at the hotel, or during their two-hour drive home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. This directly contradicted Dunn's [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_claims | defense claims]] during the [[legal_proceedings_and_trial_outcomes | trial]].

[!quote] "Unfortunately, this is not one of them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>
> A detective stated this when Dunn repeatedly tried to justify his actions as [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_claims | self-defense]].

## Charges and Pre-Trial Custody
Dunn was charged with murder and attempted murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. There was no bond for a murder charge in Duval County <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. He was remanded into custody at the Duval County Jail, where he remained for 14 months awaiting [[legal_proceedings_and_trial_outcomes | trial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

## Trial and Conviction
During the [[legal_proceedings_and_trial_outcomes | trial]], Dunn's lawyer instructed him to present his statements with increased emphasis and conviction, particularly regarding the alleged threats and the presence of a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. He claimed he heard "kill that f***ing cracker" and saw a "barrel" of a gun, believing he was about to be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. He also added a new detail not mentioned in his interrogation: the victim saying, "this sh*t's going down now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.

However, the jury had access to his earlier interrogation where he was asked the same questions, revealing inconsistencies in his narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. The prosecution highlighted Dunn's emotional display during the trial over his dog and fiancee, contrasting it with his lack of emotion when describing the shooting of Jordan Davis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. This was seen by the jury as a "contrived and narcissistic attempt at elevating his own character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

On February 15, 2014, Michael Dunn was found guilty on three counts of attempted murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.

## Sentencing and Imprisonment
For the three counts of attempted murder, Michael Dunn was rendered a 90-year sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. Seven months later, on October 1, he was rendered an additional life sentence without the possibility of parole for the murder of Jordan Davis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

His appeal was denied by the first district court on November 17, 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. Michael Dunn is currently being held at the maximum-security Oregon State Penitentiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.

The case of Stephanie Lazarus involves the murder of Sherri Rasmussen, a crime that went unsolved for over two decades until detectives employed psychological tactics during an interrogation to uncover the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## The Interrogation: A Calculated Ruse

Detectives devised a plan to bring Stephanie Lazarus, a police officer herself, into an interrogation by creating a ruse, inviting her to advise them on a stolen art case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Knowing they were dealing with a fellow officer, they prepared extensively for the interview, aiming to keep the conversation casual for as long as possible before initiating confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

### Setting the Scene and Tone
Upon Stephanie's arrival, detectives immediately established a compatible, friendly tone, negating the negative implications of being in an interrogation room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. They gave a seemingly plausible reason for meeting in such an "unusual location"â€”to avoid spreading rumors or innuendo within the squadron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The actual, strategic reason was to ensure Stephanie would check in her firearm before entering, without raising suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Introducing the Victim's Husband
The detectives introduced the name of John Ruetten, the man for whom Stephanie had committed first-degree homicide over two decades prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. They deliberately mispronounced his name, a strategy to observe her reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Stephanie's pause before responding was noted by a psychiatrist as being four times longer than it should have been, indicating deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. She acted as if she hadn't thought about the name for a long time, despite John Ruetten being the second longest relationship in her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Stephanie's Deceptive Responses

Throughout the interview, Stephanie exhibited various deceptive behaviors:
*   **Omissions and Understatements:** She stated she met John Ruetten in the dorms at UCLA around 1978 and graduated in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. She initially claimed they were "very close friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, but omitted the fact that they dated for four years and went on numerous holidays together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. When directly asked if there was a relationship, she admitted they had dated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Fight or Flight Response:** When John Ruetten's wife, Sherri Rasmussen, was mentioned, Stephanie's brain likely triggered a fight or flight response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. She chose to "fight" by engaging with the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Feigned Vague Memory:** Stephanie frequently used exclamatory remarks like "gosh" and "god" to express surprise or strong emotion, attempting to insinuate a vague memory due to a supposed "lack of contemplation" on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. She aimed to create the impression that she had no reason to think about John or anything related to him since they stopped seeing each other over two decades prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Hyper-arousal and Tangents:** As the interrogation progressed, Stephanie began to over-explain things that didn't require explanation, a sign of hyper-arousal and a derivative of Terror Management Theory (TMT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. She detailed her education, her husband Scott, when she met him, and her living arrangements, all as means for momentary relief from the terrifying reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Contradictory Statements:** Initially, Stephanie claimed she "may have" met Sherri Rasmussen but couldn't remember her name or anything about her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. However, eight separate witnesses testified that Stephanie had confronted Sherri aggressively at the hospital where Sherri worked, leading to Stephanie being escorted off the premises by security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Reports indicated Stephanie was the more combative and even made threats against Sherri's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## Escalation and DNA Request

The detectives continuously ramped up pressure. When Stephanie challenged them for the second time, asking "what's this all about," the question was avoided in a more confrontational manner, with no reassurance offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

As the detectives revealed the case was related to John's wife and her death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, Stephanie finally verbalized the victim's tragic demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. She claimed she learned about it from a poster at work or a flyer, or hearing about it from John or his friend Mike Baldrick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

The detectives eventually directly asked Stephanie if she would be willing to give a DNA swab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. At this point, she stated she probably needed to talk to a lawyer, recognizing the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. She expressed disbelief, saying, "I just can't believe it that's I mean we understand that I mean if we were in your position I mean we would feel the same way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

## Verdict and Sentence

Stephanie Lazarus was read her Miranda rights, confirming she understood her rights to remain silent and to an attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. When asked if she wanted to talk to them, she replied, "No" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

The jury found Stephanie Eileen Lazarus guilty of the murder of Sherri Rasmussen, a felony in the first degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. John Ruetten gave a powerful statement during the sentencing, describing Sherri's profound impact on many people and the indescribable sadness caused by her loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. He emphasized Sherri's extraordinary character, her professionalism, and her compassionate nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. He stated that the fact Sherri's death occurred because she met and married him brought him to his knees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

On August 5th, 2017, Leroy Daugherty, 28, a manager and head chef at the Bonefish Grill where Savannah Gold worked, was arrested during his shift by police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. While the ostensible reason for his arrest was an outstanding traffic warrant, the true intention was to interrogate him regarding Savannah's disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This arrest marked the beginning of a crucial interrogation process that would ultimately lead to a confession and reveal the gruesome [[crime_details_and_investigation | details]] of Savannah Gold's murder.

## The Interrogation Process

Upon arrival at the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office (JSO) Police Department, Daugherty was left alone for 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This deliberate isolation was a tactic to induce anxiety and allow him to contemplate his situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. His growing unease intensified when Detective Rae Reeves, the same investigator who had previously interviewed him about Savannah, entered the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This confirmed Daugherty's suspicion that his situation was far more serious than a traffic warrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The interrogation began with an open-ended question about his relationship with Savannah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Daugherty provided a lengthy and detailed response, admitting to an on-and-off relationship with Savannah for the past eight months, despite it being against company policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. He also claimed they both used drugs, and that Savannah had become heavily involved with heroin, which led him to distance himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. He then stated that the last contact he had with her was a text message three weeks prior, in which she said she would delete his number and never text him again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

### Shifting Alibis

However, confronted by the detective about his previous statement, Daugherty conceded that he had not been truthful and admitted to seeing Savannah on Wednesday afternoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. He claimed that Savannah was spreading rumors at work about their sexual relationship, which could jeopardize his job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. He then fabricated a story:
*   Savannah pulled into the parking lot after him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   She then asked to sit in his car because she had used heroin and was feeling paranoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   They had an argument, and she became angry, threatening to continue spreading lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   Daugherty stated that Savannah then got out of his car with her phone, walked towards the main entrance, and got into a green Ford pickup truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

The detective, aware of the surveillance footage, allowed Daugherty to elaborate on his fabricated story, feigning belief to lower his guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### Confrontation and Revelation

The first direct confrontation occurred when the detective abruptly asked, "Where's Savannah right now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. Daugherty's composed response, "I don't know," indicated he was anticipating such a direct accusation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. The detectives continued to press him, appealing to his morality and emphasizing the family's right to know what happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

The interrogation intensified as the female detective revealed the crucial piece of evidence: the surveillance footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. She informed Daugherty that the video showed Savannah never got out of his car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. She highlighted the struggle observed in the car, stating, "She kept kickin' that door three times, Lee, she kicked it. We saw it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>. The detective then pressed him on whether Savannah had overdosed, attempting to offer a morally acceptable alternative for what happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

Ultimately, Daugherty amended his story, admitting that he went to his house with Savannah in the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. The interrogation footage ends shortly after this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.

## The Confession and Crime Details

Leroy Daugherty admitted to killing Savannah Gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. He claimed to have killed her by breaking her neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. After the murder, he took her body back to his house, where he burned it in a self-made fire pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. He then disposed of her remains in a lake at the dead end of a secluded road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

The medical examiner determined that Savannah had injuries to over 75% of her body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. Due to the extent of the damage, the exact cause of death could not be pinpointed, but the conclusion was a violent homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.

Footage released by the JSO showed Daugherty moments after his confession, experiencing an overwhelming emotional reckoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

## [[Legal consequences of crime | Legal Consequences]]

Daugherty was remanded into custody at the Duval County Jail and denied bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Despite the overwhelming evidence and the prospect of life in prison without parole, he pleaded not guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.

His defense was that Savannah's killing was an act of self-defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. Daugherty, who stood at 5 foot 11 and weighed 163 pounds, claimed he feared for his life after Savannah, who was 5 feet tall and weighed 91 pounds, slapped him multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. He stated that he grabbed her neck, felt a pop, and accidentally broke it, resulting in her death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

The State Attorney's Office made no comment on this motion, only stating that the trial was expected to commence during the summer of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

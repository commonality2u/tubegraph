Detective Sergeant Jim Smith, a trained polygraph technician and senior investigator with the policing behavioral sciences unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29">[04:29]</a>, utilized several [[Psychological techniques in suspect interviews | psychological techniques]] during the interrogation of Colonel David Russell Williams.

## Establishing Control and Stripping Confidence
Upon meeting Colonel Williams, who was accustomed to being addressed by his rank and having his social standing accentuated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30">[00:30]</a>, Detective Smith immediately set an informal tone. He casually acknowledged Williams' military background but quickly brushed it aside, addressing him by his first name, "Russell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01">[05:01]</a>.
This informal address served to:
*   Take the Colonel "down from his elevated platform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11">[05:11]</a>.
*   Strip away his confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15">[05:15]</a>.
*   Increase the telling signs in body language and intonation when information was fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16">[05:16]</a>.
*   Decrease cognitive stamina, lessening the time an individual can maintain a facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>.

## Subliminal Control and Rights
Although Williams was informed he was "not under arrest" and "free to leave" at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02">[07:02]</a>, a subtle [[investigation_tactics_and_police_interrogation | subconscious strategy]] was employed to deter him from leaving. The detective positioned himself between Williams and the door, sending a subliminal message that leaving would require "going through" the detective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18">[07:18]</a>. Williams was also offered the option to speak with a lawyer at any point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34">[07:34]</a>.

## Gathering Pretext (Alibi)
A key [[criminal_interrogation_techniques | strategy]] in [[interrogation_techniques | interrogations]] is gathering pretext, which involves getting an initial alibi from the suspect before the confrontational phase begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48">[11:48]</a>. This phase is kept calm to elicit more detailed information, which can later be scrutinized and correlated with any changes made at a later stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00">[12:00]</a>.
*   Williams was asked to state his movements and activity over the past four days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44">[11:44]</a>.
*   The pretext gathering then focused on the murder of Marie-France Como <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35">[14:35]</a>.

## Detecting Discomposure
The analysis of vocal intonation can be a tricky aspect of [[interrogation_techniques_and_analysis | interrogations]], as it cannot be used as direct evidence in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34">[10:34]</a>. However, [[detective_interrogation_techniques | intuition]] can suggest discomposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39">[10:39]</a>. Williams' speaking manner during questioning about the Marie-France Como case came across as slightly nervous and unsure, appearing agitated in how he processed information and communicated responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43">[10:43]</a>. This "cognitive recognition" is characterized by investigators as "gut instinct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55">[10:55]</a>.

### Strategic Silence
When Williams repeatedly stated he couldn't remember answers, the detective offered "no such reassurance whatsoever," maintaining a "stoic gaze and not a single shift in body posture during the moments of silence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02">[17:02]</a>. In contrast to normal interactions where reassurance or encouragement might be given, this lack of response heightened the psychological pressure.

## Exaggerating Evidence and Heightening Pressure
Police had acquired only two pieces of physical evidence at this point: tire tracks and footprints outside Jessica Lloyd's residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24">[19:24]</a>. DNA found on Marie-France Como was not admissible due to decomposition, and male DNA found on another victim was from a less severe attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32">[19:32]</a>. The tire tracks were from a common brand and would be easily refuted in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04">[20:04]</a>. The only significant piece of evidence was the footprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17">[20:17]</a>.

However, the detective intentionally fabricated affirmations to heighten [[police_interrogation_tactics | psychological pressure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11">[21:11]</a>:
*   He claimed footprints were "pretty much in the area of a fingerprints" in terms of reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38">[21:38]</a>.
*   He later reiterated that footwear impressions are "very much like fingerprint comparisons" and that the prints taken from Williams' boots were "identical" to those found at the scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06">[22:06]</a>.
*   He falsely stated that DNA from Marie-France Como's body would likely match Williams before the evening was over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40">[24:40]</a>.
*   He claimed that the Center of Forensic Science was "on call 24 hours a day" for this "major investigation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53">[24:53]</a>.

## Manipulating Credibility and Control
The detective emphasized that Williams' "opportunity to take some control" and provide an "explanation that anybody is going to believe is quickly expiring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00">[25:00]</a>. He warned that once the DNA and footwear impression matches were solidified, Williams' "credibility is gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31">[25:31]</a>. He then presented a false dichotomy: either Williams cooperates, or he is viewed as a "cold-blooded psychopath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27">[26:27]</a>.

## Creating Urgency and Empathy
The detective underlined the ongoing search for Jessica Lloyd's body, stating it would continue until she was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38">[27:38]</a>. He then leveraged the emotional aspect by saying he didn't want Jessica's parents to "continue to wonder where her daughter's lying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21">[27:21]</a>. He also hinted at a "bad, bad ending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15">[27:15]</a> if Williams did not cooperate.

He also brought up the financial cost of the investigation, stating it would be "no less than 10 million dollars easy," and that any request from the major case manager would be approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:12">[30:12]</a>. He offered to "minimize the impact" on Williams' life if he started "by telling the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09">[31:09]</a>.

## Eliciting Confession
By combining exaggerated evidence, psychological pressure, and appeals for honesty and cooperation, the detective successfully elicited a confession from Williams about Jessica Lloyd's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51">[31:51]</a> and later, details of the murders of Jessica Lloyd and Marie-France Como <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06">[34:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:08">[35:08]</a>. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | combined interrogation techniques]] used.

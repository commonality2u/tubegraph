In police [[interrogation_and_psychological_analysis | interrogations]], detectives often employ various [[interrogation_techniques_and_strategies_used_by_detectives | interrogation techniques]] to apply [[psychological_reactions_and_body_language_during_interrogations | psychological pressure]] on suspects, aiming to elicit confessions or gain information. These methods can range from specific questioning strategies to creating an environment of amplified anxiety, especially leading up to or during a polygraph examination.

## Behavior-Provoking Questions

One technique is the use of "behavior-provoking questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These questions are designed to reveal a suspect's mindset and potential deception based on their response type:
*   **Innocent Person**: An innocent person will typically give a "draconian response," immediately suggesting the harshest possible sentence for the crime they are falsely accused of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Deceptive Individual**: A deceptive individual often gives an "equivocating response," fragmenting or diverting from the question to avoid a direct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For example, when asked what should be done to someone who hurt the children, Chris equivocated, stating uncertainty about the death penalty's use in Colorado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> and asking what it entailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Building Trust and Amplifying Anxiety

Interrogators work to establish a perceived rapport while simultaneously increasing the suspect's anxiety.
*   **Discussing Sensitive Topics**: Detectives may encourage a suspect's openness on certain topics, like marital disputes, suggesting they've been "very good" at discussing "hard conversations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, and then segue into more incriminating topics like infidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Pre-Existing Knowledge**: Interrogators might reveal information they already possess to signal their comprehensive understanding of the situation. For instance, the interrogator was aware Chris was cheating with Nicole Kessinger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> and knew that deleted phone data could be recovered by the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Setting the Stage for Polygraph**: Before a polygraph, an interrogator aims to amplify the suspect's apprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> for the "looming polygraph test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This includes indirect accusations and suggesting external pressure from "everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a> who suspects them.
*   **Passive Accusation**: This technique is used when an interrogator is almost certain of the suspect's guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. They indirectly accuse and "indignify" the suspect, often by praising them for "trivial deeds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, such as taking care of children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This is distinct from the "reframing technique," which aims to shift the suspect's self-view from negative to positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Polygraph Examination and Psychological Pressure

The polygraph pre-test phase is a critical time for applying [[interrogation_and_psychological_analysis | psychological analysis]] and pressure.
*   **False Reassurance**: The polygrapher may disguise [[psychological_reactions_and_body_language_during_interrogations | psychological pressure]] as reassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, emphasizing their training and ability to confirm innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This is often used when guilt is "almost conclusive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, as a heightened state of anxiety makes it harder to "beat" the polygraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Obtaining Examinee's Version**: The polygrapher will obtain the examinee's account of the specific issues under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, even if vague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Disguised Routine Questioning**: Polygraphers may use "subterfuge of [[psychological_reactions_and_body_language_during_interrogations | psychological pressure]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a> by asking seemingly routine questions, such as "what are ways that you can make someone disappear?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a> This familiarizes the suspect with specific terminology that will be used in polygraph questions.
*   **Directed Lie Polygraph**: This test involves three types of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>:
    *   **Known Truth Questions**: Easy questions (e.g., "Are you sitting down?") that provide a baseline for truth-telling and reset thought patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
    *   **Control Questions**: Questions where the subject is purposely instructed to lie (e.g., "Before 2018 did you ever lose your temper with someone you cared about?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. These are designed so all answers will be "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
    *   **Relevant Questions**: Questions specific to the crime, which the examinee is supposed to answer truthfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
    *   **Detection of Guilt**: A guilty subject will exhibit a stronger physiological reaction to relevant questions than to control questions, even if lying to both, due to the "immediate threat" posed by the relevant questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Feedback Manipulation**: After a practice run, the polygrapher provides feedback, often stating the suspect is a "really bad liar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a> and that their reactions to lies were "significant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. This feedback is designed to further increase anxiety for the real test, suggesting that any deception during the actual examination will be "10 times more amplified" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

## Polygraph Results and Pressure to Confess

Upon completion of the polygraph, the interrogator may immediately declare the suspect "did not pass the polygraph test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. This direct accusation, combined with the earlier psychological conditioning, creates immense pressure, leading directly to the demand to "talk about what actually happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a> and encouraging a confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. These [[interrogation_strategies_used_by_detectives | strategies]] aim to break down a suspect's resistance by highlighting what is presented as undeniable evidence of deception.

On November 23, 2012, Michael Dunn, a 45-year-old software developer, shot and killed 17-year-old Jordan Davis at a gas station in Jacksonville, Florida, following an altercation over loud music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Dunn claimed self-defense, asserting that he felt threatened by Davis and his friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Background
Michael Dunn, engaged to 45-year-old nurse Rhonda Rauer, traveled to Jacksonville from their home in Brevard County for his son's wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. They had their seven-month-old French Bulldog, Charlie, waiting for them at a hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. After the wedding reception, where both had several alcoholic drinks, they decided to stop at a Gate gas station on Bay Meadows Road to buy a bottle of wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Gas Station Confrontation
Upon pulling into the gas station, Dunn's Volkswagen parked next to a red Dodge Durango belonging to 18-year-old Tommy Storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Inside the Durango were Storms' three friends: Leland Brunson, Jordan Davis, and Tevin Thompson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Loud music was playing from the Durango <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Initial Interaction
Before Rhonda Rauer went into the store, Dunn commented to her, "I hate that thug music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Tevin Thompson stated that Dunn asked them to turn the music down, saying, "Can you turn the music down, I can't hear myself think?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Thompson complied and turned the music down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. However, Jordan Davis then told Thompson to turn the music back up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Escalation and Shooting
When Tommy Storms returned to the Durango, Tevin Thompson turned the music down to explain what had happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Dunn then asked Jordan Davis, "Are you talking to me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Davis responded, "Yeah, I'm talking to you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. According to a witness, Dunn then yelled, "No, you're not gonna talk to me that way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Dunn reached into his glove compartment, pulled out a large caliber silver chrome handgun, either a nine-millimeter or .45, and racked it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Within three minutes of parking, Dunn fired 10 shots into the Durango <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. The first three shots came through the back passenger-side door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Tommy Storms quickly put the SUV in reverse and backed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. As the vehicle fled, shots 5, 6, and 7 came through the front passenger-side door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Dunn then got out of his car, aimed at the retreating SUV, and fired three more shots into the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Victim
Jordan Davis was struck three times, in the leg, lungs, and heart, and bled to death in under 45 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. He was 17 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The quick actions of Tommy Storms by backing up likely saved multiple lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Flight and Aftermath
Approximately 20 seconds after the gunfire ceased, Rhonda Rauer, who had been inside the store, realized her fiance had fired the shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Dunn told her to "Get in the car" with urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Conversation in the Car
Rhonda asked Dunn what happened, and he stated, "I shot at the car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. When asked why, he claimed, "They threatened to kill me" and that they "started to advance and I reacted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. He told her he hadn't hurt anyone, only shot at the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Rhonda kept her thoughts to herself because Dunn was already upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Return to Hotel and Discovery of News
Upon returning to the Sheraton Hotel, Dunn walked the dog, ordered a pizza, and poured himself a rum and coke before they went to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. The next morning, Rhonda saw news footage of a red SUV being towed, heard mention of a "shooting convenience store," "loud music," and "one dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Dunn was in the doorway of the bathroom and said, "Yes, I saw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### Drive Home
Rhonda told Dunn, "We need to go home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. They drove straight back to their house, not stopping anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Dunn repeatedly told Rhonda he loved her throughout the "horrible" trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

## Police Interrogation
Police tracked Michael Dunn down at his home in Brevard County using his number plate, which witnesses at the scene had noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. He was brought to the JSO police department for interrogation, which began 22 hours after the shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### Dunn's Self-Defense Claim
Dunn attempted to portray himself as a victim with no choice but to act, needing to appear rational and reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. He claimed that after he politely asked the occupants of the SUV to turn down their music, which they did, the music came back on, and the guy in the back started getting "really agitated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. He claimed to hear them saying "kill him" or "kill that [\h__\h]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Dunn stated that the individual went down, came up with what he "thought it was a shotgun," said "you're dead [\h__\h]," and opened his door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. He then unholstered his pistol, which he kept in his glove box, and shot, boasting about his gun handling skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. He initially claimed to have shot four times, then four more as they were fleeing because he was "still scared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Dunn also stated he left the scene because he was "still afraid" and that he "never been so scared in my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

### Detectives' Challenges and Contradictions
The detectives employed tactics to destabilize Dunn's narrative, noting inconsistencies in his story, such as his behavior after the shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. They questioned why he didn't call 911 from the hotel if he was so scared, referencing a case where a threatened individual immediately called police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. They emphasized that no weapon was found in the truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Dunn's claim of seeing a "shotgun" changed to a "barrel" and then potentially a "stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.

Detectives also highlighted the issue of him firing four more shots into the vehicle as it was retreating, noting that a fleeing vehicle is no longer a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. They questioned why he would get out of his car if he truly believed the occupants had a shotgun and were trying to kill him, stating that he was putting himself at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. Dunn attributed this to "adrenaline" and "panic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

Forensics refuted Dunn's claim that Jordan Davis was getting out of the truck, proving that Davis was hit while still in the back seat and the door was shut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. Detectives also noted that none of the other occupants in the truck had a history of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>. They stated that if there had been a gun, they would have shot Dunn from inside the truck without getting out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

### Contradictions and Charges
As the pressure mounted, Dunn asked, "Do I need to get a lawyer? I mean, it sounds like I'm in deep [\h__\h]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. He was then informed that Duval County had issued a warrant for his arrest for murder and attempted murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. Dunn expressed surprise and reiterated that he believed his actions were self-defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. He was told there would be no bond on a murder charge in Duval County <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>.

## Trial and Verdict
Michael Dunn was remanded into custody at the Duval County Jail, where he remained for 14 months awaiting trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.

### Dunn's Trial Testimony
During the trial, Dunn's testimony showed a significant increase in emphasis and conviction, likely due to legal instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. He claimed to have heard clearer threats, such as "kill that [\h__\h]" and that Jordan Davis was "screaming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. He asserted that Davis "showed me a gun and he's threatening me" and that he believed he was "gonna be killed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>. He also introduced a new detail, that Davis said "this shit's going down now," a statement not mentioned in his interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>. He tearfully spoke of his love for Rhonda and their dog Charlie, but showed no emotion when describing the moment he took a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>.

### Rhonda Rauer's Testimony
Rhonda Rauer testified that Dunn never told her he saw a gun or any weapon in the red SUV, either immediately after the shooting, back at the hotel, or during the two-hour drive home the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. This directly contradicted Dunn's trial claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.

### Conviction and Sentencing
On February 15, 2014, Michael Dunn was found guilty on three counts of attempted murder, for which he received a 90-year sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. Seven months later, on October 1, he was given an additional life sentence without the possibility of parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>. His appeal was denied on November 17, 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. He is currently incarcerated at the maximum-security Oregon State Penitentiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a>.

[[crime_details_and_investigation | The investigation into the shooting]] highlighted significant inconsistencies in Dunn's account of the event and the immediate aftermath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

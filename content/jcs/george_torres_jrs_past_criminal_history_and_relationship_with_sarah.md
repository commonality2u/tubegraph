George Torres Jr., 42, was the boyfriend of 42-year-old [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_challenges_in_sarah_boones_case | Sarah Boone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. His death on the night of February 23, 2020, was attributed to suffocation after being locked inside a suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Relationship Dynamics with Sarah Boone

Sarah's initial explanation for George's death was that it was a "totally unintentional and unforeseen accident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. She claimed they were playing hide-and-seek after a night of drinking wine and doing puzzles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. She stated George got into the suitcase willingly, and she zipped it up jokingly before falling asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

However, the relationship between George and Sarah was complex and marked by domestic issues:
*   **Alcohol Consumption** [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_challenges_in_sarah_boones_case | Sarah]] admitted they had been drinking wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Later, she implied that she only drank occasionally due to George <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.
*   **Domestic Violence** George was on parole for domestic violence against [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_challenges_in_sarah_boones_case | Sarah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. He had been arrested multiple times for domestic violence against her, and [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_challenges_in_sarah_boones_case | Sarah]] had reportedly bailed him out each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   **Past Incidents** [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_challenges_in_sarah_boones_case | Sarah]]'s last call to police regarding domestic violence against George did not result in charges for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. She referred to a "curtain rod incident" about a month prior to George's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.
*   **Sarah's Perspective on Abuse** [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_challenges_in_sarah_boones_case | Sarah]] stated that George "comes at me all the time," and her usual response was to "flee or try to go upstairs and go to sleep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. She also mentioned filing a restraining order against George at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.
*   **Anger Management** [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_challenges_in_sarah_boones_case | Sarah]] claimed George was attending anger management classes and making progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. She believed he had "changed" and expressed her love for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.

## George's Injuries

During the investigation, an autopsy revealed injuries to George Torres Jr. that were sustained the night he died, none of which were present before he entered the apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. These injuries included:
*   Injuries to his left shoulder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
*   A cut near his lip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
*   His mouth was "a little" injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   A contusion on his neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.
*   Bruising on the left side of his forehead, head, and skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

[[legal_proceedings_and_defense_challenges_in_sarah_boones_case | Sarah]] denied causing these injuries, suggesting he might have fallen off her son's bike or frequently ran into walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>, and claimed she had "not touched him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

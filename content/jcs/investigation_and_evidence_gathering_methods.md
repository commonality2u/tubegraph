Police and detectives employ various methods for investigation and gathering evidence, particularly in complex cases. These methods can range from initial public appeals and physical evidence collection to sophisticated [[Interrogation techniques and strategies | interrogation techniques]] and forensic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Initial Investigations

When a missing person report is filed, especially in areas with low crime rates, local authorities can immediately launch extensive investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. For example, in the case of Jessica Lloyd, the Ottawa police force dedicated an entire division, supported by over 2000 public members and a Canadian Air Force search and rescue unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Information Gathering and Public Assistance
The spread of information through media can lead to crucial anonymous tips from the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. An anonymous tip about an unusually parked SUV led police to a specific area of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Physical Evidence Collection
Upon receiving a tip, police will canvass the specified area to look for physical evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. In the Jessica Lloyd case, tire tracks in a field and boot prints leading to her house were discovered, becoming foundational pieces of evidence for the investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Roadblocks and Surveillance
To narrow down suspects based on physical evidence like tire tracks, police may set up roadblocks to stop and inspect vehicles that match the criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. If a vehicle's characteristics match evidence, its owner may be placed under immediate police surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## [[Interrogation techniques and analysis | Interrogation Techniques]]

Police utilize specific [[Psychological techniques in suspect interviews | psychological techniques in suspect interviews]] to elicit information and confessions. Detective Sergeant Jim Smith, a trained polygraph technician and senior investigator from the policing behavioral sciences unit, exemplifies the expertise involved in these processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Creating an Interrogation Environment
*   **Recording**: Interrogation rooms are typically videotaped and audiotaped to document the entire process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Positioning**: Detectives often sit between the subject and the door, creating a subliminal message that exiting the room requires going through the interrogator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Psychological Strategies
*   **Stripping Confidence**: Informally addressing a high-ranking individual by their first name, rather than their title, can be a deliberate tactic to "take the kernel down from his elevated platform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This technique aims to strip away confidence, potentially increasing telling signs in body language and intonation when information is fabricated, and decreasing cognitive stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Establishing Respect (Initial Phase)**: The interrogator often begins by stating a rule of mutual respect, setting a controlled tone for the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Clarifying Rights (Canadian Context)**: Suspects are informed of their rights, including that they are not under arrest and are free to leave, but the specific Canadian version of these rights is explained to avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. They are also informed of their right to consult a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Voice Analysis/Intuition**: While not admissible as evidence, analysis of vocal intonation and perceived discomposure can provide investigators with a "gut instinct" about a subject's truthfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Gathering Pretext**: This forensic psychology technique involves asking the suspect to detail their movements and activities over a specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The goal is to obtain an initial alibi before a confrontational phase begins, as a relaxed suspect may provide more detailed information that can later be scrutinized for inconsistencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Lack of Reassurance**: During moments of silence or when a suspect struggles to remember, detectives may intentionally offer no reassurance or emotional assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. This contrasts with normal interactions and can increase psychological pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

### Confrontational Tactics (Reid Technique-adjacent)
*   **False Evidence Ploy**: Detectives may fabricate evidence to heighten psychological pressure on a suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. For instance, claiming that footprints are as incriminating as fingerprints, or that common tire tracks are an undeniable match, even when forensic capabilities for such claims are limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
*   **Exaggerating Evidence**: Falsely stating that newly acquired evidence (like forensic matches) will immediately solidify guilt and destroy credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. The detective might claim that DNA will be matched before the evening is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>, even if forensic analysis is not as immediate as suggested.
*   **Minimization**: Suggesting that providing an explanation or confessing is the "only option" to avoid a worse outcome, such as being labeled a "cold-blooded psychopath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. The interrogator might imply that cooperation will help "minimize the impact" on the suspect's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
*   **Emphasizing Investigative Resources**: Informing the suspect that the investigation is massive, well-funded (e.g., "costing no less than 10 million dollars easy"), and will continue indefinitely until all questions are answered, indicating that police will not give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   **Emotional Appeals**: Appealing to the suspect's conscience by mentioning the victim's family and their suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Offering Control**: Presenting the act of confessing as an opportunity for the suspect to take "some control" over the situation and provide their explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

## Forensic Capabilities and Limitations

### Types of Evidence
*   **Tire Tracks and Footprints**: These can be significant early evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. However, tire tracks from common brands can be easily refuted by a defense team as they may not meet the "guilt beyond all reasonable doubt" standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Footprints, while valuable, are not as incriminating or indistinguishable as fingerprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **DNA Evidence**: While powerful, DNA analysis has limitations depending on the state of the sample and available technology. For instance, highly decomposed bodies might not yield admissible DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. In 2010, this was prior to widespread "next-generation sequencing" for DNA testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. Even if male DNA is found on a victim, it might be from the least severe attack and lack exterior elements connecting it to more serious crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

### Legal Standards
*   **Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (BRD)**: This is the standard of proof required in criminal cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Evidence must be strong enough to overcome any reasonable doubt of guilt.

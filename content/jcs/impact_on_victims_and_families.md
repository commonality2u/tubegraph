The shooting incident on November 23, 2012, at a Gate gas station on Bay Meadows Road resulted in the death of a teenager and had significant impacts on multiple individuals involved.

## Jordan Davis and His Companions
Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old, was struck three times during the shooting by Michael Dunn, sustaining wounds to the leg, lungs, and heart, which led to him bleeding to death in under 45 seconds [00:08:48]. His companions, Tommy Storms, Leyland Brunson, and Tevin Thompson, were also in the vehicle at the time of the shooting [00:05:08]. Quick thinking by Tommy Storms, who put the car in reverse and backed up at full speed, is credited with likely saving multiple lives [00:08:39].

The victims, including Jordan Davis, were described by detectives as not having a history of violence or a track record of criminal behavior [00:35:37]. The purpose of their stop at the gas station was for the driver to buy cigarettes after returning from the mall [00:36:04].

## Michael Dunn's Perspective on Being a Victim
Michael Dunn, the shooter, repeatedly asserted that he was the victim in the incident. He claimed to have been "preyed upon" and fought back [00:01:23]. He stated, "I refuse to be a victim and now I'm incarcerated" [00:01:43]. Dunn claimed he was going to be killed for merely asking the occupants of the other vehicle to turn down their radio [00:01:49]. During his interrogation, Dunn stated he was "scared" [00:18:16], "never been so scared in my life" [00:19:54], and acted out of "panic" without time to think, only reacting [00:30:22], [00:45:05]. He maintained that he believed the individuals in the other car had a weapon, describing seeing a "shotgun," "barrel," or "stick" [00:16:40], [00:23:55], [00:24:28].

Detectives challenged Dunn's narrative, noting his apparent boasting about his gun handling skills during the interrogation despite claiming to be traumatized [00:17:43]. They also pointed out inconsistencies in his story, such as why he didn't call the police immediately if he felt threatened, and the lack of any weapon found in the victims' vehicle [00:21:56], [00:27:40].

## Rhonda Rauer's Experience
Rhonda Rauer, Michael Dunn's fiancée, was with him during the incident. She realized her fiancée was the shooter approximately 20 seconds after the gunfire ceased [00:09:00]. Upon returning to the car, Michael urgently told her to "get in the car" [00:09:13]. When she asked what happened, he replied, "I shot at the car" [00:09:45]. Michael later told her they "threatened to kill me," and "they started to advance and I reacted" [00:10:00].

Rhonda privately considered Michael's actions to be "stupid" but kept her thoughts to herself to avoid adding to his upset [00:10:34]. The morning after the shooting, she saw news of a "shooting convenience store," "loud music," and "one dead" person, which made her realize the severity of the situation [00:11:46]. She urged Michael to go home, describing the drive as a "horrible trip home" during which she didn't want to hear anything, only wanting to get home [00:12:41].

During her interview with police four days later, Rhonda refuted Michael's claims about seeing a weapon or him taking his gun into the hotel room [00:20:29], [00:55:22]. She stated that Michael never told her he saw a gun, weapon, stick, shotgun, barrel, or lead pipe in the other SUV at any point, from the gas station to the hotel to the drive home [00:55:22].

## Legal Outcomes
On February 15, 2014, Michael Dunn was found guilty on three counts of attempted murder, receiving a 90-year sentence [00:56:24]. Seven months later, on October 1, he was given an additional life sentence without the possibility of parole [00:56:31]. His appeal was denied on November 17, 2016 [00:56:35]. He is currently held at the maximum security Oregon State Penitentiary [00:56:41].

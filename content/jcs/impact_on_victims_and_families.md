The shooting incident significantly impacted both the direct victims and their families, as well as those closely associated with the perpetrator.

## The Deceased Victim: Jordan Davis

The primary victim of the shooting was 17-year-old Jordan Davis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:57">[0:08:57]</a>. He was struck three times, sustaining wounds to his leg, lungs, and heart, which led to him bleeding to death in under 45 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:52">[0:08:52]</a>. Investigators noted that Jordan Davis had no history of violence and no criminal record, nor did the other occupants of the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:35:38">[0:35:38]</a>. They were described as "not violent guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:35:58">[0:35:58]</a>, having just returned from the mall and stopping for cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:07">[0:36:07]</a>.

## Other Occupants of the Vehicle

The other two occupants of the Dodge Durango, Tevin Thompson and Leyland Brunson, along with the driver Tommy Storms, were also in the line of fire. Quick thinking by Tommy Storms, who put the car in reverse, likely saved multiple lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:40">[0:08:40]</a>. Despite the vehicle being hit by multiple shots, including three directly through the front passenger side door and one narrowly missing the driver's head, the other three occupants were physically unharmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:10">[0:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:43:13">[0:43:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:43:40">[0:43:40]</a>.

## Michael Dunn's Fiancee: Rhonda Rauer

Rhonda Rauer, Michael Dunn's fiancee, was inside the gas station store during the shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:59">[0:05:59]</a>. Roughly 20 seconds after the gunfire ceased, she realized her fiance had fired the shots and went outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:00">[0:09:00]</a>. Dunn urgently told her to "get in the car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:13">[0:09:13]</a>.

In the car, Rhonda asked what happened, and Dunn replied he "shot at the car" because "they threatened to kill me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:40">[0:09:40]</a>. When asked if he hurt anyone, he stated, "no I just shot at the car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:16">[0:10:16]</a>. Rhonda admitted she was thinking, "you stupid ass, what were you thinking why would you do this" but kept those thoughts to herself as he was already upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:34">[0:10:34]</a>.

The next morning, Rhonda saw news of a shooting at a convenience store involving a red SUV, loud music, and "one dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:30">[0:11:30]</a>. She confronted Dunn, who confirmed he saw the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:53">[0:11:53]</a>. Rhonda immediately urged them to "go home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:03">[0:12:03]</a>. The drive home was described as "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:41">[0:12:41]</a>, with Rhonda not wanting to hear anything, just wanting to get home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:50">[0:12:50]</a>.

During her interview, Rhonda refuted many of Dunn's claims, stating he never mentioned seeing a gun, weapon, stick, shotgun, barrel, or lead pipe in the other vehicle, either immediately after the shooting, back at the hotel, or during the two-hour drive home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:55:20">[0:55:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:55:48">[0:55:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:56:03">[0:56:03]</a>.

## Michael Dunn's Self-Perception

Throughout his interrogation and trial, Michael Dunn repeatedly portrayed himself as the victim.

> [!QUOTE] Michael Dunn: "I'm the victim here, I was the one that was being preyed upon and I fought back." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:01:18">[0:01:18]</a>
>
> [!QUOTE] Michael Dunn: "I refuse to be a victim and now I'm incarcerated." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:01:43">[0:01:43]</a>

He claimed to have been "scared for his life" and in "such a panic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:39:44">[0:39:44]</a>. He also expressed emotional distress over his fiancee and their dog, Charlie, during his testimony, attempting to portray himself as a noble and selfless individual protecting his loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:56">[0:52:56]</a>. However, prosecutors noted his lack of emotion when discussing taking a young man's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:53:48">[0:53:48]</a>.

The detectives challenged Dunn's narrative, questioning why he didn't call the police if he was truly a victim and emphasizing that there was no weapon found in the victims' car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:21:56">[0:21:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:40">[0:27:40]</a>. They stated that his actions of shooting at a fleeing vehicle were an "issue" because they were "no longer a threat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:28:08">[0:28:08]</a>.

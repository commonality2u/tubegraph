## The Disappearance of Tori Stafford

On April 8, 2009, eight-year-old Tori Stafford was last seen leaving Oliver Stevens School in Woodstock, Ontario, at 3:25 p.m., two minutes after the dismissal bell, to retrieve her mother's butterfly earrings [00:00:03]. She never returned home [00:00:25]. Her grandmother reported her missing at 6:04 p.m., immediately launching a missing-persons [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | investigation]] [00:00:28].

Surveillance footage from a local high school, discovered approximately seven hours later, captured Tori walking side-by-side with an unidentified woman [00:00:36]. Tori did not appear to be struggling in the video [00:00:44]. The woman was described as 19-25 years old, white, 5 foot 2, about 125 pounds, with a black ponytail [00:00:47].

Local police made a public appeal for the woman to come forward, and Tori's grandparents offered a $10,000 reward [00:00:55]. A Facebook group dedicated to finding her amassed over 20,000 followers in under 24 hours [00:01:03]. Four days later, on April 12, hundreds gathered for a vigil, and Tori's mother made a televised appeal [00:01:07]. Over the following week, Tori's parents were interviewed and passed polygraph tests [00:01:19].

Ground searches were called off six days after her disappearance due to a lack of clues [00:01:24]. America's Most Wanted featured Tori's case as its top story [00:01:30]. On April 17, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) took the lead in the [[criminal_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | investigation]], and ground searches resumed [00:01:35]. The case was reclassified as an abduction [00:01:41]. A media campaign was escalated with the release of a composite sketch of the woman, circulated on social media and local news [00:01:45].

## Apprehension and Interrogations

On May 19, police identified the woman as 18-year-old Terri-Lynn McClintic, who was already in custody for breaching a probation order related to a previous drug violation [00:01:54]. She was transferred to Ontario Police Headquarters and interviewed by Detective Sergeant Jim Smith at approximately 5:30 p.m. [00:02:03].

### Terri-Lynn McClintic's Interrogation

Initially, McClintic denied being the woman in the video and claimed no knowledge of the missing girl [00:02:09]. However, roughly 45 minutes into the [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation]], she broke [00:02:13]. She described the abduction and killing of Tori Stafford in detail [00:02:55]. McClintic stated she lured Tori into a secluded parking space with the promise of showing her a puppy [00:02:57]. Tori was then forced into the back seat of a vehicle driven by 28-year-old Michael Rafferty [00:03:03]. Rafferty drove to a secluded area about a hundred miles north of Woodstock, where he sexually assaulted and murdered Tori [00:03:08]. The fatal injuries were four strikes to the head with a claw hammer [00:03:16].

McClintic drew a rough sketch of the area where Tori was killed, which led police to discover the girl's remains [00:03:20]. Tori was found with lacerations to her liver and sixteen broken ribs, and her cause of death was confirmed to be repeated blows to the head with a blunt object, correlating with McClintic's testimony [00:03:26].

### Michael Rafferty's Interrogation

At 7:55 p.m. that evening, Michael Rafferty was arrested, charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder, read his rights, and brought to police headquarters for immediate [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation]] [00:03:37].

The OPP has a highly trained Behavioral Sciences unit, whose forensic psychiatry subdivision is recognized as one of the best in the world [00:05:11]. Staff Sergeant Chris Loam, a police officer for over 21 years and head of the analysis section of the Behavioral Sciences unit, conducted Rafferty's [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation]] [00:07:02]. His section was responsible for criminal profiling, threat assessment, and forensic psychiatry [00:07:14].

#### [[interrogation_techniques | Interrogation Techniques]] Used

*   **Rapport Development:** The investigator maintained a friendly and nonchalant disposition during the opening phase to foster a perception of solidarity and respect, making the suspect more likely to cooperate [00:05:20]. This also downplayed the crime's severity, making admission less intimidating [00:05:34].
*   **Threat Assessment (as stated by Loam):** Loam initially claimed his purpose was to assess Rafferty's threat level, specifically whether he would "go out and kill more people" [00:06:19]. The narrator notes that for severe crimes like rape and murder, the threat level is already assessed before psychoanalysis [00:07:25]. In reality, the investigator's primary goal is to understand the suspect's character to influence their reasoning and decision-making [00:07:34].
*   **Mental Exhaustion:** The detective frequently rambled, a common [[interrogation_techniques | strategy]] to keep a suspect's mind racing [00:18:07]. This prevents the suspect from conjuring lies or disassociating, methodically breaking them down through mental exhaustion and chipping away at psychological stamina [00:18:10].
*   **Discouraging Denials:** The investigator watches for denials and stops them immediately, as allowing denials increases a suspect's morale and psychological endurance for self-preservation [00:14:30]. Loam repeatedly states that evidence proves Rafferty's involvement and that denying it only destroys his credibility [00:14:47].
*   **Good Cop/Bad Cop (Mutt and Jeff Technique):** After 95 minutes, the investigators initiated this technique [00:33:19]. The theory behind it is the "fear then relief response," where extreme emotional shifts can disorient a suspect, affecting their critical thinking and making compliance more likely [00:39:16]. While one officer (the "bad cop") aggressively confronts Rafferty with graphic details of McClintic's testimony and evidence, the other (the "good cop," Loam) maintains his calm, understanding demeanor, offering Rafferty a chance to share his side [00:33:35, 00:39:56].

#### Rafferty's Demeanor and Investigator's Observations

Rafferty appeared as a "quivering mess," acting like a helpless victim vying for sympathy, which was noted as ironic given his actions against Tori [00:13:13]. The interrogator observed that Rafferty's refusal to eat or drink indicated internal turmoil and guilt [00:26:01]. Rafferty's body language, described as curling up in a fetal position, was interpreted as an acknowledgment that "it's all over" [00:26:15]. Rafferty was seen clinging to hope by refusing to admit involvement but also displaying situational awareness, knowing his act wasn't convincing [00:44:40]. His concern about how eating would be perceived highlights his internal conflict between hunger and portraying guilt [00:44:52].

### Outcome

Despite the varied [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation techniques]] used, including the "Mutt and Jeff" approach, Rafferty remained unyielding and did not confess during the recorded segment [00:31:19, 00:46:15]. He was ultimately found guilty of murdering, kidnapping, and sexually assaulting Tori Stafford [00:55:27]. Michael Rafferty and Terri-Lynn McClintic were both sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years [00:57:16].

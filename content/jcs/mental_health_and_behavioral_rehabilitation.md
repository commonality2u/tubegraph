In mid-2018, 29-year-old Grant, who was unemployed and living rent-free, developed a significant [[online_addiction_and_its_consequences | online addiction]] to cam sites [00:00:00]. He spent over $200,000 of his family's money, including his father's life savings and money from his brother's credit card, on a single cam model [00:00:51].

## Initial Intervention and Rehabilitation
Upon discovering the extent of Grant's spending, his family opted not to call the police but instead sent him to a [[addiction_and_rehabilitation | behavioral rehabilitation facility for online porn addiction]] [00:01:10].

## Post-Rehabilitation Challenges
After returning from rehab on January 4th, Grant's father presented him with a two-page list of rules for continuing to live at home [00:01:28]. One of the primary conditions was that he immediately cease all communication with the cam model [00:01:36]. However, within three weeks, the family discovered he had broken this rule and re-established contact via Twitter [00:01:39].

His father had previously admitted him to a depression or [[addiction_and_rehabilitation | addiction clinic]] called Cornerstone in Fort Lauderdale [00:13:38]. Grant claimed he didn't agree to go, but his father, with the support of his mother and brother, insisted [00:13:54]. His father's reasoning for sending him was Grant's acting negatively, particularly concerning his financial behavior [00:14:15].

## Grant's Perspective on Mental Health
Grant stated that at the Cornerstone clinic, he spoke to therapists and psychiatrists [00:17:21]. He reported that he was told he did not need any medications [00:17:24]. The clinic reportedly diagnosed his behavior as an "isolated event" and attributed it to "PTSD from the whole getting arrested thing" [00:17:29]. He felt his living situation had been stressful, then improved, and was again stressful [00:17:57].

## Interrogation and Psychological Analysis
During the [[interrogation_and_psychological_analysis | interrogation]], detectives made several attempts to engage with Grant's perceived emotional and mental state:
*   The initial plan was to establish a friendly connection to elicit a more detailed discourse [00:04:26].
*   The lead interrogator attempted to get Grant to confess by suggesting that "accidents happen" and "things in the Heat of the Moment things happen" [00:24:37].
*   He claimed to be able to "read people" through their eyes and body language, suggesting Grant was holding something back and was "hurting inside" [00:25:04].
*   The male detective attempted to elicit a confession by focusing on Grant's perceived stress and embarrassment over his financial debt due to the cam model [00:32:27].
*   The female detective attempted to afford Grant "justifications for the crime," such as acting in self-defense, to make admission less intimidating [00:34:25].

Grant stated his belief that the detectives were "leading me into a certain way" [00:35:00]. Despite the detectives' tactics, Grant maintained that he did not know what happened at the house [00:29:05].

### Grant's Reaction to the Crime
Grant displayed a "reminiscent smile" when his mother was brought up in the discussion, despite allegedly having shot her [00:10:24]. When confronted about his family's deaths, Grant claimed he was "scared" and "don't know how to even say the words" [00:33:17]. He expressed that he was worried since the previous night but "knew when you guys told me" [00:41:38].

### Suicidal Ideation Check
Towards the end of the interrogation, Grant was asked if he wanted to hurt himself or anyone else and if he had any suicidal thoughts, to which he responded "no" [00:51:22].

## Conclusion
Grant was arrested nine hours later [00:51:30]. His trial began on August 12, 2019, focusing on his "blind obsession" with the cam model [00:52:28]. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole [00:52:55].

On November 23, 2012, software developer Michael Dunn shot and killed 17-year-old Jordan Davis at a gas station in Jacksonville, Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. Dunn claimed his actions were in [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_claims | self-defense]], asserting he was threatened and saw a weapon, leading to his firing of 10 shots into a Dodge Durango occupied by four teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## The Incident
On the night of the shooting, Michael Dunn, 45, and his fiancée, Rhonda Rauer, 45, were returning to their hotel after attending his son's wedding reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. They stopped at a Gate gas station on Baymeadows Road for wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Michael Dunn parked next to a red Dodge Durango occupied by 18-year-old Tommy Storms and his three friends, Leyland Brunson, Jordan Davis, and Tevin Thompson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Dunn reportedly expressed dislike for "thug music" playing loudly from the SUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

While Rhonda Rauer was inside the store, Dunn asked the occupants of the Durango to turn their music down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Tevin Thompson complied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, but Jordan Davis reportedly told him to turn it back up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. An argument ensued between Dunn and Davis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Dunn then retrieved a gun from his glove compartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a> and fired multiple shots into the SUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Michael Dunn's Self-Defense Claim

After his arrest and during his interrogation, Michael Dunn consistently claimed he acted in [[legal_proceedings_and_defense_claims | self-defense]]:
*   **Initial Statement**: Dunn told his fiancée, Rhonda, immediately after the shooting that he shot at the car because "they threatened to kill me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. He further stated, "I'm the victim here... I was the one that was being preyed upon and I fought back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He emphasized, "I refuse to be a victim and now I'm incarcerated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Perceived Threat**: During his police interrogation, Dunn claimed he heard the teenagers saying "kill him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He stated Jordan Davis went "down on the ground and comes up with something" he thought was a shotgun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, saying "You're dead [expletive]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. He later changed this to "a barrel or a stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   **Fear for Life**: Dunn repeatedly stated he was "scared for his life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>, "in fear for my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>, and "didn't have time to think, I only reacted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.
*   **Continued Firing**: He justified firing additional shots at the retreating vehicle by stating he still thought they had a weapon and was trying to prevent them from shooting back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. He claimed to be in "such a panic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

## Analysis of the Self-Defense Claim

[[interrogation_analysis_techniques | Interrogation analysis techniques]] and later testimony highlighted significant inconsistencies in Dunn's account:
*   **Behavior Inconsistent with Fear**: Despite claiming to be terrified, Dunn did not call 911 immediately after the shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. Instead, he drove back to his hotel, ordered pizza, and walked his dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Detectives noted this was not typical [[emotional_responses_in_criminal_investigations | emotional responses]] or [[behavioral_analysis_in_criminal_cases | behavior]] for someone who genuinely feared for their life, as a truly threatened individual would likely seek police assistance immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Weapon Description**: Dunn's description of a weapon changed from a "shotgun" to a "barrel or a stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. [[Forensic investigation techniques | Forensic evidence]] later confirmed no weapon or stick was found in or near the Durango <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
*   **Actions During the Shooting**: Dunn got out of his car and fired three additional shots at the SUV as it was retreating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Detectives challenged this, pointing out that if he truly believed the occupants had a shotgun, he would not have exited his car, as it would expose him to more danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. Firing at a retreating vehicle also suggests the threat was no longer present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.
*   **Contradiction by Fiancée**: Rhonda Rauer testified that Michael Dunn never mentioned seeing a gun, weapon, stick, or anything that resembled a threat from the teenagers in the SUV, either at the gas station, at the hotel, or during their two-hour drive home the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>. This directly contradicted Dunn's claims that he told her "several times" about the self-defense nature of the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>.
*   **Lack of Concern for Victim**: The prosecution noted that Dunn frequently reverted to personal reasons for his actions, such as not wanting trouble or causing sleepless nights for the police, but never expressed remorse or concern for the life he took <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>. His emotional display during the trial regarding his pet dog was perceived as a contrived attempt to show appealing human traits, contrasting with his lack of emotion discussing Jordan Davis's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

## Outcome
On February 15, 2014, Michael Dunn was found guilty on three counts of attempted murder for firing at the other teenagers in the vehicle, receiving a 90-year sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. Seven months later, on October 1, he was sentenced to an additional life sentence without the possibility of parole for Jordan Davis's murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>. His appeal was denied on November 17, 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.

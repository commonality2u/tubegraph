Behavior-provoking questions are a specific type of [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation technique]] used to elicit different responses from innocent versus deceptive individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These questions are designed to reveal behavioral cues that can indicate guilt or innocence during an [[interrogation_techniques_and_analysis | interrogation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Characteristics and Responses

### The Question Itself
A common behavior-provoking question asks the suspect what they believe should happen to the person who committed the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Responses from Innocent Individuals
An innocent person typically provides a "draconian response" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This means they will immediately suggest the harshest possible sentence for the crime they are being falsely accused of committing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. For example, when asked what should be done to the guy who took the children, Chris, at an early stage, suggested "life in prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Responses from Deceptive Individuals
In contrast, a deceptive individual often gives an "equivocating response" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This involves fragmenting or diverting from the question to avoid responding to it entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. For instance, when asked what should happen if the children were hurt, Chris shifted his answer, questioning if the death penalty was even used in Colorado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. He further equivocated by stating that if the kids were not alive, "there's nothing you could do" to cope with that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This difference in response can be a key indicator in [[innocent_versus_guilty_behavior_during_interrogations | innocent versus guilty behavior during interrogations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

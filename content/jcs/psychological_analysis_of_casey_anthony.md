The case surrounding [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee Anthony]]'s death is marked by disturbing and perplexing details, particularly concerning the psychological constitution of her mother, [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey Anthony]]. The primary focus shifted from the crime itself to [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey Anthony]]'s response to her daughter's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Clinical psychologists who evaluated [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey Anthony]] during her custody found no signs of mental illness or psychological abnormalities, making her character study both fascinating and terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Initial Disappearance and Lack of Concern

On July 15, 2008, [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee Anthony]]'s grandmother, Cindy Anthony, called 911, reporting that her granddaughter had been missing for a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Cindy stated that her daughter, [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey Anthony]], finally admitted the baby was gone and that [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]]'s car smelled like a dead body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

[[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey Anthony]] had left the family home a month prior with [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee]], claiming a work assignment in Tampa and that [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee]] was with a nanny named Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez, or "Zanny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Suspicion escalated when [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]]'s father, George Anthony, discovered a strong odor of human decomposition from the trunk of [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]]'s impounded car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. When confronted at her boyfriend's house, where she was found smoking marijuana and watching TV, [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]] claimed [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee]] had been kidnapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

During the 911 call, [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]]'s dialogue showed no urgency or concern, contrasting sharply with her mother's distraught demeanor. She required repeated questioning from the dispatcher to provide information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This indifference immediately made her the prime suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Interrogations and Deceptive Behavior

During her initial interview on July 16, 2008, [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]] provided numerous fabrications about her babysitter, "Zaneda Fernandez Gonzalez," and her employment at Universal Studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Both Zaneda and a co-worker, Juliette Lewis, were later proven to be non-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Her detailed, eloquent, and natural responses, used to camouflage anxiety, were identified as textbook signs of a pathological liar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### The Impact of Nurture

[[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey Anthony]]'s history suggests that nurture played a significant role in her deceptive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. She had a history of getting away with misconduct by continuously lying without conscience. A notable example was her skipping the second half of her senior year of high school; her parents covered for her, even throwing an extravagant graduation party, which led her to believe that lying could always resolve her problems, even with national law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### Confrontation and Continued Deception

After her initial arrest, [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]] led detectives to multiple fake addresses and then to Universal Studios, where she eventually admitted she didn't work there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. When confronted with the fact that everything she told them was a lie, she continued to insist she didn't know where [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee]] was, claiming she was scared and naive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. She appeared more afraid of her mother's reaction than of never seeing her daughter again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.

A phone call from jail revealed [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]]'s nonchalant attitude toward her arrest, asking her mother, "I just saw your nice little cami on TV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. She blamed her mother for her incarceration and showed more concern for contacting her boyfriend than for her missing daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

## Public Perception and Emotional Display

During a visit from her parents in protective custody, [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]]'s parents expressed forgiveness and asked about [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee]]'s whereabouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. When told the whole United States was looking for [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee]] and her photo would be on People magazine, [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]]'s response was almost as if it were a lost cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

Her composure finally slipped when her father encouraged her to cry, expressing pain for herself rather than for [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. This contrasted with her lack of emotion earlier when she saw her deceased daughter's face on her father's shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. She consistently dismissed her parents' inquiries about [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee]]'s whereabouts as irritating, yet showed tears when they focused on her own well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. She also attacked the characters of people trying to help with the search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

Her ability to intertwine specific details to make her lies credible was evident when describing the non-existent nanny's name and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.

## Murder Charge Interrogation and Sociopathic Traits

After being charged with first-degree murder, [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]]'s interrogation footage was described as "bizarre" and "comical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. Despite detectives' obvious accusations of guilt, [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]] maintained a confident, talkative, and light-hearted disposition, as if the situation were an everyday occurrence unrelated to her daughter's disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. She spoke about the grand jury and [[Media coverage and public perception of the Anthony case | media surrounding her trial]] as if discussing a TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.

Her seemingly genuine expressions of agreement with the detective while offering no actual information, or her casual remarks about mundane things, were noted as surreal given the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. She even discussed her father's difficult testimony for her indictment with surprising calmness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.

The public consensus, based on her behavior in the footage, was that she was a cold-hearted mother or a despicable murderer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. However, analysis suggests her poised temperament was entirely fake, used to mask anxiety and conceal guilty behavior. This constant fabrication of personality, even in extraordinary settings, is linked to sociopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>. Sociopaths seek an advantage by lying and calculating their reactions before situations occur, with their focus on making themselves look good rather than genuine concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>. [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]] was described as an inauthentic person, and her skill at deception is arguably the most terrifying aspect of the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>.

## Trial and Verdict

[[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee Anthony]]'s remains were found on December 11, 2008, less than a mile from the Anthony household, wrapped in a Winnie-the-Pooh blanket inside a laundry bag with duct tape around her skull, ruling her death a homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

Evidence showed [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]] made internet searches for "how to make chloroform" on the day [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee]] was last seen alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. In the following weeks, she was seen partying, participating in a "hot body contest," and getting a "bella vita" (beautiful life) tattoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. A diary entry stated, "This is the happiest that I have been in a very long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.

During the trial, the prosecution argued [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]] suffocated [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee]] with duct tape to pursue a "good life" free from parental responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. The defense, however, presented an alternative theory: [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee]] drowned in the family pool, and [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]] concealed the death due to a history of trauma, including alleged sexual abuse by her father, which taught her to hide pain and lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.

The defense attorney, Jose Baez, expertly used narrative control and storytelling, appealing to the jury's emotions by arguing the prosecution was trying to make them hate [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. He emphasized that the state had the burden of proof and that if the jury had questions, the case was not proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.

On July 5, 2011, the jury found [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey Anthony]] not guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and aggravated manslaughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>. Her attorney stated that the verdict was a lesson against [[Media coverage and public perception of the Anthony case | media assassination]] and prejudice, asserting that [[Casey Anthonys behavior and legal proceedings | Casey]] did not murder [[Kaylee Anthonys disappearance and death | Kaylee]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.

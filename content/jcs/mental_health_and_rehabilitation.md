Grant Amato's personal and financial issues led to his family sending him to a behavioral rehabilitation facility to address his online addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Admission to Rehabilitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>

In mid-December 2018, Grant's father decided to admit him to a "depression or an [[the_struggle_of_addiction | addiction]] clinic" in Fort Lauderdale called Cornerstone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Grant did not agree to go, but his father insisted, acting as the "Iron Fist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Both his mother and brother, Cody, agreed with the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

The primary reason for his admission, from his father's perspective, was Grant's behavior and perceived lack of positive action, which often circled back to money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Grant later revealed he had spent about $200,000 on a cam model from Bulgaria using his father's and brother's money, pretending it was for Twitch streaming advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

Grant was at Cornerstone from December 22nd, 2018, until January 4th, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The cost of his stay was $15,000, paid for by his brother, Cody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

## Diagnosis and Outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>

During his time at Cornerstone, Grant spoke with therapists and psychiatrists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. The facility's analysis concluded that he did not require any medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

The diagnosis was that his behavior was an "isolated event" and that he had [[emotional_responses_in_criminal_investigations | PTSD]] from a prior arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. Grant perceived their final diagnosis as him being "fine" and not needing to be there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. He was initially signed up to stay for 60 days but was released on January 4th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

Upon his return from rehab, Grant's father presented him with a two-page list of rules for continuing to live at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. One key condition was to cease all communication with the cam model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. However, within three weeks, his family discovered he had re-established contact with the model via Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This breach led to a heated argument and Grant being kicked out of the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

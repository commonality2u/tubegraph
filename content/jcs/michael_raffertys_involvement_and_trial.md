On April 8, 2009, eight-year-old Tori Stafford was last seen leaving Oliver Stevens School in Woodstock, Ontario, at 3:27 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> She was captured on surveillance footage leaving the premises two minutes after the dismissal bell, having gone back inside for her mother's butterfly earrings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Tori was reported missing by her grandmother at 6:04 p.m. the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Initial Investigation and Discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
Approximately seven hours after Tori was reported missing, surveillance footage from a local high school was discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This footage, according to police, showed Tori walking side-by-side with an unidentified woman, appearing not to struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The woman was described as 19 to 25 years old, white, 5 foot 2, about 125 pounds, with a black ponytail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

A public appeal was made for the woman in the video to come forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, and Tori's grandparents offered a $10,000 reward for her return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. A Facebook group dedicated to finding Tori gained over 20,000 followers in under 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. On April 12, hundreds gathered in Woodstock for a vigil, and Tori's mother made a televised appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Tori's parents were interviewed by investigators and passed polygraph tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Ground searches were called off six days after her disappearance due to a lack of clues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

"America's Most Wanted" featured Tori's case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. On April 17, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) took the lead in the investigation, and ground searches resumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The case was officially reclassified as an abduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. A composite sketch of the woman in the video was released and circulated widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Terry Lynn McClintock's Confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
On May 19, police identified the woman as 18-year-old Terry Lynn McClintock, who was already in custody for breaching a probation order related to a prior drug violation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. She was interviewed at 5:30 p.m. by Detective Sergeant Jim Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Initially, she denied involvement and knowledge of Tori's disappearance, but broke down 45 minutes into the interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

McClintock described in detail the abduction and killing of Tori Stafford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. She stated she lured Tori into a secluded parking space by promising to show her a puppy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Tori was then forced into the back seat of a vehicle driven by 28-year-old Michael Rafferty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Rafferty drove to a secluded area about 100 miles north of Woodstock, where he sexually assaulted and murdered the eight-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The fatal injuries were four strikes to the head with a claw hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

McClintock drew a sketch of the area where Tori was killed, which led police to discover Tori's remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Tori was found with lacerations to her liver and 16 broken ribs, and her cause of death was confirmed to be repeated blows to the head with a blunt object, correlating with Terry Lynn's testimony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Michael Rafferty's Arrest and Interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
At 7:55 p.m. that same evening, Michael Rafferty was arrested and charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He was read his rights and brought to police headquarters for interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

The interrogation began with Staff Sergeant Chris Loam, a member of the OPP's Behavioral Sciences unit and head of the analysis section, which includes criminal profiling, threat assessment, and forensic psychiatry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Interrogation Techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   **Rapport Development:** The investigator maintained a friendly and nonchalant disposition to make the suspect more likely to cooperate and downplay the crime's severity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Loam stated his purpose was to assess Rafferty's threat level, claiming nothing Rafferty could say would surprise him due to his knowledge of the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. However, the true primary purpose was to understand Rafferty's character and influence his reasoning and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Confrontation with Evidence:** Loam informed Rafferty that the evidence had led them to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. He highlighted that Rafferty had previously flown under the radar with no major police issues, making his current involvement a "serious situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Loam used the case of Michael Briere, who abducted and killed Holly Jones, as an example of how things can happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. He stressed that they knew "the who" and "the what," leaving only "the why" for Rafferty to explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Emotional and Psychological Pressure:** Loam tried to convey empathy, stating, "we all make mistakes," and that if Rafferty could turn back time, he would make different decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. He stated that Rafferty's credibility was all he had left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Rafferty's demeanor was observed as a "quivering mess, acting like a helpless victim wallowing in his own self-pity while vying for sympathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The detective continually watched for denials and stopped them to prevent Rafferty from increasing his morale and psychological endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **The Mutt and [[Jeffs interrogation and charges | Jeff]] Technique (Good Cop/Bad Cop):** After 95 minutes, Rafferty remained unyielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. The investigators initiated the Mutt and [[Jeffs interrogation and charges | Jeff]] technique, with a new officer taking a "bad cop" role, directly confronting Rafferty with Terry Lynn's detailed statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. Terry Lynn stated that Rafferty drove, she lured Tori, pushed her into the car, and they drove to Guelph, then to a Home Depot for garbage bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. She further stated that Rafferty sexually assaulted and killed Tori in a farmer's field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. The officer also highlighted that Tori's DNA would be found "all over your car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. This technique, based on the "fear-then-relief" response, aims to disorient the suspect and make compliance more likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.

Despite the psychological pressure, Rafferty remained silent or gave evasive answers. He questioned why the investigator was asking if he wanted food, concerned about how it would be perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>. The transcript notes this as an "intriguing moment" where Rafferty was clinging to hope but was also situationally aware of his perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.

## Trial and Verdict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>
31-year-old Michael Rafferty was found guilty of murdering, kidnapping, and sexually assaulting eight-year-old Tori Stafford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. The trial lasted nearly 10 weeks in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>. The verdict was reached quickly, in just over a day of deliberations, leading to a collective sigh of relief among friends and family in the courtroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. Lawyers from both sides appreciated that justice was done and thanked the jury for sitting through the difficult case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.

## Sentencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>
Both Michael Rafferty and Terry Lynn McClintock were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.

In mid-2018, 29-year-old Grant Amato was unemployed and living rent-free in his parents' guest house in Chuliota, Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He had never lived on his own and had recently been kicked out of anesthesiology school for lack of attendance, in addition to being fired from a nursing job for stealing medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Around this time, he began experimenting with online cam sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Development of the Addiction

Online cam sites differ from regular porn sites by being interactive, allowing users to solicit live performances from models for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Using his brother's credit card, Grant browsed multiple models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Forensics later discovered that on June 5th, he connected with a performer known as Sylvie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Over the following six months, Grant spent over $200,000 of his family's money on Sylvie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This expenditure consumed his father's entire life savings, accumulated over 30 years as a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. He also spent $60,000 from his brother's credit card and took out a $65,000 loan on the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Family Intervention and Rehabilitation

When his family discovered the extent of his spending, they chose not to call the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Instead, Grant was sent to a [[mental_health_and_behavioral_rehabilitation | behavioral rehabilitation]] facility specializing in online porn [[addiction_and_rehabilitation | addiction and rehabilitation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This facility, Cornerstone in Fort Lauderdale, was attended from December 22nd to January 4th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, costing $15,000 paid for by his brother Cody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Grant initially did not agree to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

At the facility, therapists and psychiatrists analyzed his situation, concluding that it was an "isolated event" caused by being out of work and experiencing PTSD from a previous arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. They determined he did not need medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

## Relapse and Escalation of Conflict

Upon returning from rehab on January 4th, Grant's father presented him with a two-page list of rules for continued residency, including immediately ceasing all communication with Sylvie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. However, within three weeks, his family discovered he had broken the contract and re-established contact with the model via Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

On January 24th, his father, Chad Amato, confronted Grant, leading to a heated argument that nearly became physical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Grant was subsequently kicked out of the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Murders and Subsequent Actions

The next morning, shortly before 9 AM, police received a call from Cody Amato's girlfriend when he failed to show up for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Upon entering the residence, Chad, Margaret, and Cody Amato were found dead from gunshot wounds to the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Grant became the prime suspect due to the prior night's confrontation and bizarre circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. He was traced to a hotel in Orlando <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

Police later proved that Grant had shot his mother, Margaret, in the back of the head while she was at the computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:34">[02:31:34]</a>. He then waited for his father, Chad, and shot him twice in the head as he entered the kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:39">[02:31:39]</a>. Cody then received a text from his father's phone asking him to come home urgently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:45">[02:31:45]</a>. Forensics believed Cody was likely pleading for his life before being found with a gunshot wound to the face, lying in the fetal position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:50">[02:31:50]</a>.

Grant's brother's credit card was stolen, and an estimated 30 minutes after Cody's death, a purchase for $600 was made to a cam site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:58">[02:31:58]</a>. This was done by Grant using free Wi-Fi in a Publix supermarket parking lot between midnight and 1 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:30">[02:32:30]</a>. This demonstrates the role of [[internet_search_history_as_evidence | online activity as evidence]] in the case.

## Interrogation and Lack of Confession

During his interrogation, Grant was not informed of his family's deaths or the purpose of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. He did not inquire about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Detectives attempted various tactics to elicit a [[murder_confession_and_its_consequences | murder confession]], including:
*   Establishing a friendly connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
*   Suggesting an "accident" or "heat of the moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
*   Appealing to honesty and offering help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   Implying knowledge of the truth through "eyes" and "body language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
*   Affording justifications for the crime, such as self-defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   Emphasizing the irreversible nature of his actions and the limited window for cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
*   Highlighting the "embarrassment" and financial strain of his addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

Grant continuously denied involvement, maintaining that he didn't know what happened or that Cody would "take care of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. He suggested a shooting between Cody and his father to "protect or help" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

Grant expressed being "scared" for himself and the outcome of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. He admitted to feeling love for the cam model, which motivated his continued contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## Trial and Conviction

Grant was arrested nine hours after his interrogation at his hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. His trial began on August 12, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

During the [[legal_implications_and_court_proceedings | court proceedings]], the prosecution highlighted Grant's "blind obsession" with Sylvie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. A key piece of evidence presented was that at 2:53 AM on January 25th, after leaving his family's dead bodies, Grant went to a nearby Publix parking lot, accessed their Wi-Fi, and used his dead brother's checking account to pay $599.99 to access Sylvie's website at 3:02 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. The case was framed around his obsession and "absolute contempt" for those he held responsible for his problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

Grant Amato was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. This case illustrates the devastating [[impact_on_victims_and_families | impact on victims and families]] and the severe [[legal_consequences_of_crime | legal consequences of crime]] that can arise from unchecked addiction and its resultant conflicts.

Internet search history has become a considerably more efficient component in [[forensic_investigative_process | forensic investigations]] over the past two decades, a process that might have previously taken weeks or months to conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The disclosure of web browser data is often a crucial piece of evidence for building a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. It can unveil many aspects of a suspect's personality that would otherwise remain hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. In some instances, this evidence can be far more effective than other information presented in court, including details extracted during a full confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Unveiling a Suspect's Personality

Internet search history can provide deep insights into a suspect's motivations and psychological realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For example, in the case of Stephen McDaniel, his web browser data revealed extensive time spent watching pornography with themes of violence and torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. He also conducted repeated searches on "how to commit sexual assault" and various forms of "how to molest sleeping girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Psychological Interpretation

To forensics, these searches are considered an overt sign of desensitization to sexual activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Excessive exposure to online pornography can build a tolerance to the traditional idea of sex over time, leading individuals to seek more potent forms of stimuli to achieve the same sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. For Stephen McDaniel, this progression from watching abstract material online eventually led him to plan and carry out the acts he viewed on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Detectives often prepare extensively for [[interrogation_and_psychological_analysis | interviews]], especially when the suspect is an insider [00:00:08]. Their initial strategy is to keep the conversation as casual as possible, gradually escalating to confrontation at key moments [00:00:11].

## Setting the Tone

Establishing a compatible and friendly tone with a suspect is a crucial first step in [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation techniques]] [00:00:37]. Upon entering an [[interrogation_analysis | interrogation]] room, detectives may try to negate the negative implications of the environment through a friendly disposition [00:00:43]. They might provide a deceptive reason for meeting in such an unusual location, for instance, to avoid spreading rumors, when the real reason is often to disarm the suspect, such as requiring firearms to be checked in [00:01:05].

## Initial Deception and Reactions

When confronted with a name connected to a past crime, a suspect's initial reaction can be telling [00:01:38]. Detectives may intentionally mispronounce a key name as a simple strategy to observe the suspect's reaction [00:01:53]. In one case, a suspect's prolonged pause, four times longer than it should have been, was later identified by a psychiatrist as a sign of deception [00:02:04]. The suspect was acting as if she hadn't thought about the name for a long time, attempting to justify her reflection, despite the name likely being engraved in her memory [00:02:08]. Furthermore, a truthful subject will often volunteer significant information, such as a past dating relationship, without being directly asked, whereas a deceptive one might omit it [00:02:50].

## Fight or Flight Response

The mention of a victim's relation, such as "his wife," can trigger an immediate psychological reaction known as "fight or flight" [00:03:37]. This involves a sudden influx of hormones preparing the individual to either confront the threat or escape to safety [00:03:47]. The suspect's choice to "fight," rather than flee, indicates a decision to engage with the confrontation [00:03:58].

## Verbal Cues of Deception

Frequent use of exclamatory remarks like "gosh," "God," or "Jeez" can be a verbal cue [00:04:23]. These phrases are often used to express surprise or strong emotion, but in an [[interrogation_analysis | interrogation]], they may be used to insinuate a vague memory due to a claimed lack of contemplation on the subject matter [00:04:35]. This attempts to convey the impression that the suspect had no reason to dwell on the related subject for a long time [00:04:41].

## Addressing Confrontation and Pressure

An experienced suspect, especially someone familiar with police work, may be aware that acting oblivious to an unusual situation would be a red flag to investigators [00:05:01]. While guilty suspects might try to act naive to avoid a blatant confrontation, truthful subjects tend to address it directly, seeking immediate clarification [00:05:15].

When a suspect challenges the detectives, the [[detective_strategies_in_police_interrogations | detectives]] may subtly avoid the direct question while offering a deceptively reassuring response [00:05:46]. They might shift the focus back to a false perception of being on the suspect's side, reassuring them about privacy and confidentiality [00:05:57]. The suspect may warily accept this reassurance, falling back into a pattern of claiming a foggy memory [00:06:45].

As [[psychological_pressure_on_suspects | pressure]] mounts, detectives might become more confrontational while still avoiding direct answers, ramping up the intensity in a subtle yet effective manner [00:10:50].

## Hyper-arousal and Terror Management Theory (TMT)

A clear indication of hyper-arousal and a derivative of Terror Management Theory (TMT) is when a suspect over-explains things that do not require an explanation or were not even inquired about [00:07:29]. This behavior allows the suspect to go off on unrelated tangents, gaining momentary relief from the terrifying reality of the [[crime_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | interrogation]] [00:07:42]. Psychiatrists believe this is a subconscious coping mechanism often observed in [[interrogation_analysis | interrogations]] involving serious charges [00:07:59].

## Body Language and Emotional Responses

Non-verbal cues can reveal significant information. A suspect's facial expression can change dramatically, even if they are pretending to be reflective, showing genuine thought when the true difficulty of a question arises [00:12:26]. Additionally, unmitigated terror can be evident in a suspect's face when they verbalize a victim's tragic demise for the first time in years [00:13:42]. A suspect's disposition may switch from passive and truthful to frantic when attempting to maintain a vague memory [00:15:36].

As the [[the_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | investigation]] progresses and DNA evidence is requested, a suspect's discomfort may increase, leading them to request a lawyer [00:19:00]. This is often accompanied by expressions of shock and disbelief, as the suspect may feel accused despite earlier reassurances [00:20:45].

## Miranda Rights and Conclusion

When a suspect requests an attorney, law enforcement must advise them of their Miranda rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney [00:21:53]. Once the suspect invokes their right to an attorney, questioning must cease [00:22:10]. Ultimately, based on evidence and [[legal_rights_and_interrogation_strategies | interrogation strategies]], suspects can be found guilty, facing severe sentences for their crimes [00:22:48].

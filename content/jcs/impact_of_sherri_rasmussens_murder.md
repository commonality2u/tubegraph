The murder of Sherri Rasmussen had a profound and lasting impact on her family, John Ruetten's family, and even Stephanie Lazarus's family, thrusting them into a "bizarre world of disbelief and indescribable sadness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

## Profound and Broad Effects
John Ruetten, Sherri's husband, stated that there are "no words that can describe the loss of sherry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. He emphasized that her loss, the way she died, and the trial held 25 years after her death, had a "profound impact on many many others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. The effects were broad, spanning a generation and "creating pain for those whose lives should have never been touched by this tragic event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Ruetten described words as "feeble tools for describing these impacts," noting "so many moments and so very many tears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.

### Personal Toll
For John Ruetten, the realization that Sherri's death occurred "because she met and married me brings me to my knees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. This highlights the deep personal toll and responsibility he felt as a result of the murder.

## Aftermath and Justice
Stephanie Lazarus was found guilty of the murder of Sherri Rasmussen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a> and was sentenced to 27 years to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. She is currently held in the maximum security unit of the Central California Women's Facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

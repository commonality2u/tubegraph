## Initial Response and Investigation
In mid-2018, law enforcement was alerted to a welfare check when Cody Amato failed to show up for work and did not respond to phone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Police arrived at the Amato residence at 9:17 AM and gained access to the home via the back entrance using a knife after receiving no answer at the front door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Inside, Chad, Margaret, and Cody Amato were found dead from gunshot wounds to the head from a nine-millimeter handgun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Grant Amato, the youngest son, immediately became the prime suspect. This was based on a witness statement from Cody's girlfriend, who informed police about a heated confrontation between Grant and his father the night before, alongside other "bizarre circumstances" leading up to the discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. [[investigative_techniques_in_crime_cases | Investigative techniques]] led to Grant being traced to a hotel in Orlando <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Interrogation Strategies
Upon locating Grant, detectives secured his cooperation; he immediately agreed to accompany them to the police station for an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Reports indicate Grant was not informed of his family's deaths, nor the purpose of the interview, and he did not inquire himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This established the conditions for the [[interrogation_techniques | interrogation]].

Detectives employed several [[interrogation_techniques_and_strategies_used_by_detectives | interrogation strategies]] and [[interrogation_techniques_and_tactics | tactics]] during the interview:

### Building Rapport
The lead investigator's initial plan was to establish a friendly connection with Grant, a common [[interrogation_techniques_used_by_detectives | tactical procedure]] aimed at eliciting a more detailed discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Detectives offered comfort, asking if he needed to use the bathroom, or wanted a drink or snacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Despite these attempts, the overall [[the_investigation_and_interrogation_techniques | interrogation]] was described as "fascinatingly aggravating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Confrontation and Justification
The first direct confrontation occurred when the detective asked Grant why he thought they were having this conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Grant claimed not to know but admitted to being "freaked out" given the situation when he left home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

The lead detective used the following approaches:
*   **Emphasizing honesty**: Stating that "the truth always is the best thing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Normalizing the act**: Suggesting "accidents happen" and "things in the heat of the moment things happen that we wish hadn't happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. He offered personal anecdotes about snapping at his own children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.
*   **Claiming to know the truth**: Stating he could "read people" and that Grant's eyes and body language indicated he wanted to "get something off his chest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. He explicitly said, "we knew everything before we asked you the questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Offering help**: Stating the police were there to "help you with issues you may have" and that being honest would "make you feel better in the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. He asserted he would "deal with someone and help them till the end no matter what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.
*   **Providing scenarios**: The female detective specifically offered justifications for the crime, making admission less intimidating by suggesting Grant might have been "defending yourself" or acting "in fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. This [[interrogation_strategies_used_by_detectives | strategy]] aimed to present a "lesser infraction" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **Highlighting dire consequences**: The detective warned that if Grant didn't confess, he "can't get any help from anybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, comparing the situation to a bomb that cannot be diffused once it has exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.
*   **Drawing out silence**: When Grant's composure began to slip, detectives strategically used silence to increase pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

### Suspect's Denial and Shifting Blame
Grant repeatedly denied involvement, stating, "I didn't do any of this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. He attempted to frame his brother, Cody, for the murders, suggesting Cody "would take care of it" after being updated by their mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. He suggested a shooting occurred "between Cody and my dad" to protect him or help him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

However, forensic evidence later contradicted Grant's account:
*   Margaret Amato was shot in the back of the head while at the computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   Chad Amato was shot twice in the head upon entering the kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
*   Cody Amato received a text from his father's phone asking him to come home urgently, and was found with a gunshot wound to the face in the fetal position, likely after pleading for his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
*   Grant used Cody's stolen credit card to spend $600 on a cam site approximately 30 minutes after the murders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. He used free Wi-Fi at a Publix supermarket parking lot for this transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

## Conclusion of Interrogation and Trial
Despite the detectives' attempts to elicit a confession, Grant maintained his innocence. He was arrested nine hours later at his hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. His trial began on August 12, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. The prosecution argued the case was about Grant's "blind obsession" with a cam model and his "absolute contempt" for his family, who he blamed for his perceived "end of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. Grant Amato was sentenced to life in prison without parole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.

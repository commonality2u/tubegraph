The conversation around space governance is increasingly intertwined with discussions about existential risks. As humanity contemplates expanding its presence beyond Earth, establishing governance structures for space is critical, especially given the potential risks that could accompany this expansion. During a candid discussion, several key points were raised regarding how space governance could influence existential risks.

## The Importance of Space Governance

Space governance involves creating policies and frameworks that dictate how space is explored and utilized. It encompasses everything from ensuring peaceful cooperation between nations to regulating the use of space resources. As the number of objects launched into orbit rises, it's crucial to have systems in place to manage these activities effectively. The current state of space governance raises significant concerns, especially with the presence of anti-satellite weapons and the lack of comprehensive regulation regarding their use (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>).

## Spreading Civilization in Space: The Ultimate Hedge?

The naive argument suggests that spreading humanity across the cosmos could serve as an ultimate hedge against extinction. By establishing multiple independent nodes of civilization, the probability of complete human extinction decreases, as catastrophic events on Earth would not affect extraterrestrial colonies. However, the independence of risks is called into question. For example, issues like pathogen transmission between planets or unaligned artificial intelligence (AI) could still pose threats regardless of humanity's physical dispersal across space [[ai_alignment_challenges_and_strategies | (AI alignment challenges and strategies)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>).

Interdependent risks such as unaligned AI could affect all human colonies simultaneously, negating the safety typically associated with geographical dispersion [[impact_of_ai_on_future_economic_growth | (Impact of AI on future economic growth)]].

## Potential Risks in Space

One must consider that space could introduce novel risks, particularly related to governance and conflict. Toby Ord's "The Precipice" highlights a 1 in 6 chance of human extinction this century, prompting questions about whether moving to space mitigates these risks or introduces new dimensions of peril [[existential_risk_and_societal_collapse | (Existential risk and societal collapse)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>).

Nick Bostrom's theory on "burning the cosmic commons" touches on the idea that the race to occupy space could mirror a "tragedy of the commons" scenario, where individual entities exploit resources rapidly, leading to detrimental long-term outcomes for potential space-faring races. The unregulated spread of von Neumann probes—self-replicating machines that use up all resources in their path—could be one extreme manifestation of such exploitation [[john_von_neumanns_contributions_to_mathematics_and_science | (John von Neumann's contributions to mathematics and science)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>).

## The Governance Challenge

Implementing effective space governance that considers these risks is a formidable challenge. The lack of mutual deterrence, because of difficulties in attribution in space (as with asteroid bombardments), could lead to greater chances of conflict. Moreover, Anders Sandberg and others argue that traditional governance models might struggle with scalability in space given the massive distances and different temporal scales [[interplay_between_ai_safety_ethics_and_governance | (Interplay between AI safety, ethics, and governance)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>).

## Conclusion

While the expansion into space could present significant opportunities for diminishing some existential risks, it also introduces new questions that must be addressed through robust governance. Creating frameworks that mitigate the risk of space conflicts and ensure peaceful utilization of cosmic resources will be pivotal. As explored in the discussion, space presents a frontier filled with both promises and perils that necessitate thoughtful governance to shield humanity from existential threats [[the_ethical_and_existential_implications_of_advanced_scientific_ideas | (The ethical and existential implications of advanced scientific ideas)]].

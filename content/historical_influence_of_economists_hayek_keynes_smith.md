This article summarizes a podcast discussion on the historical influence and key ideas of prominent economists, focusing on John Maynard Keynes, Friedrich Hayek, and Adam Smith. The conversation explores their major contributions, critiques of their work, and their lasting relevance.

## John Maynard Keynes

John Maynard Keynes is presented as a towering figure in economics, described by a quote (which he himself was quoting about Alfred Marshall but, it's suggested, also applied to himself) as requiring a "rare combination of gifts": being a "mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopher," with no part of human nature or institutions lying outside his regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The podcast host suggests Keynes was arguably the only person fitting this description at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### On Investment and "Animal Spirits"

Keynes's _General Theory of Interest, Employment, and Money_ is cited for the idea that actual investment results often disappoint the hopes that promoted them. He argued that without a "temptation to take a chance" or satisfaction beyond cold calculation, much investment might not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This points to the idea that investment can be "irrational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

The podcast discusses this in the context of:

- Active investing, VC returns potentially underperforming the market, and M&A synergies often not being achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
- The skewed nature of returns on private investment, especially including small businesses, where only a small percentage make significant profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
- The concept of "animal spirits" guiding investment decisions, suggesting humans might be more risk-seeking than is rationally good for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This is contrasted with the conventional view of humans as risk-averse, with Milton Friedman's work on context-dependent risk behavior (buying insurance and gambling) offered as a way to square this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### On Market Behavior and Speculation

Keynes believed that "investment based on genuine long-term expectation is so difficult as to be scarcely practicable," and that it was easier to guess crowd behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

- The podcast notes this might seem to predate understanding of the efficient market hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
- Keynes himself believed he could beat the markets as a short-run speculator, though this might have been luck or specific to his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The difficulty in retrospectively studying market efficiency of that era due to data limitations is mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
- Keynes argued that this focus on short-term speculation was damaging to long-term investment, which he wanted to socialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
- He also suggested that contrarian investors might be "doubly punished" by society, though this is contested by the reverence for figures like Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. However, it's clarified Keynes likely meant building factories and long-term productive assets, which was harder in his time due to less data and geopolitical turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
- Keynes observed that as markets mature, they can become more speculative, citing the New York market as more speculative than London in his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

### On Passive Investment and Market Structure

Keynes noted that as markets mature, more equities are held by passive investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The podcast discusses concerns that this could lead to:

- Lack of monitoring of company value (seen as unlikely due to continued incentives for research) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
- Collusion among large passive investors owning significant market shares (e.g., the same funds owning Coke and Pepsi) leading to reduced competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Personal Influence and Characteristics

- Keynes's ideas are often seen as products of his time, presented with overconfidence as general truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
- He changed his mind frequently, seen as both a strength and a weakness. His defenses of tariffs are cited as an example of his "bad works," and even his best work, like the _General Theory_, was arguably criticized by his later _How to Pay for the War_ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
- Despite being gay in a less tolerant era, Keynes wielded significant political power and influence, seemingly without personal danger, unlike figures like Alan Turing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. This was attributed to his political astuteness and the selective tolerance of deviance at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
- A fault attributed to Keynes was his assumption that "people like him would always be in charge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>.

## Friedrich Hayek

Friedrich Hayek's career is described as a "tremendous white pill," particularly his work _The Road to Serfdom_ (1944), written when Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. While he was "not as right as he thought at the time," he would be pleased by the decline of major collectivisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

### Critiques and Later Views

- Hayek became a "grumpy old man" in his later years, believing collectivism would still engulf the world due to "atavistic instincts" in human nature towards collectivism and envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. The podcast suggests this pessimism was not entirely justified by subsequent events in the West, and current issues like bureaucracy and sclerotic institutions may not fit his model of accruing socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
- His failures, like the inability to establish a normative standard in _The Constitution of Liberty_, are seen as reflecting a lack of rigor, a contentment with complex Germanic idea presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

### On Decentralization and Central Planning

- Hayek's famous argument about decentralization is questioned in light of large tech companies like Amazon and Uber, which appear to do well with central planning. However, the speaker, not being a Coasian, views firms like Amazon as part of the market, subject to market checks, rather than islands of central planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
- Even the later Soviet Union is described as a highly decentralized system of managers optimizing rents, rather than true central planning, which failed early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.
- Hayek's argument about the difficulty of aggregating information for a central planner is discussed alongside computer science findings that general equilibrium is computationally intractable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. The response is that markets don't solve for general equilibrium but rather for "getting us into the next day," a key Hayekian insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.

### Competition as a Discovery Process

- Hayek's essay "Competition as a Discovery Procedure" is highlighted as one of his greatest, emphasizing that the interesting part of markets is when they move between equilibria, discovering what to produce and how <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. This is related to Peter Thiel's point about monopoly allowing for R&D investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.

### Knowledge, Scientism, and Fragility

- Hayek is said to underrate "scientism," which, despite potential abuses, is relied upon heavily (e.g., mRNA vaccines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.
- The problem of "no one mind understanding things" is seen as inevitable under all systems. The price signal in a Hayekian system doesn't convey inframarginal values, which became evident during COVID-19 with supply chain issues (e.g., vaccine access from India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

### Hayekian Perspectives on AI and Prediction Markets

- Hayekians at George Mason in the 1980s (Don Lavoie, Bill Tulloh) explored issues related to AI agents and markets, with Hayek reportedly finding it interesting and in the spirit of his work [[the_role_of_cultural_and_technological_innovations_in_human_evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.
- Prediction markets would likely be seen by Hayek as markets communicating information through prices, similar to historical "bucket shops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. However, the price system is not a single dial; markets involve observing quantities and reaction speeds, a multi-dimensional problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>.

### On NIMBYism

- Hayek, in "Competition as a Discovery Process," is seen as having predicted NIMBYism with his statement about the impossibility in a democratic society of enacting necessary changes whose necessity cannot be strictly demonstrated in particular cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

## Adam Smith

Adam Smith's _The Wealth of Nations_ (1776) is noted for being published at a time when it was plausible to argue there had been no significant growth for nearly 2000 years (referencing Gibbon's _Decline and Fall_) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>.

### Vision and Rationalism

- Smith's ability to see the potential for growth through the division of labor, despite observing very small growth locally, is seen as an act of rationalism, similar to Mill's arguments on women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>. He is considered "a bit more of a rationalist than Hayek makes him out to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.
- Smith was the first known to make the point that "projectors" (entrepreneurs/startups) are overly optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
- He also emphasized human bottlenecks and constraints of the law, which might temper expectations of rapid AI-driven growth [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>.

### Context and Contemporaries

- When comparing Smith to his contemporaries, Sir James Stewart was sometimes ahead on certain matters, and David Hume (Smith's best friend) was arguably better per page, especially on monetary theory, though Smith had more numerous and important insights overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.

### On the Division of Labor

- A notable, and perhaps counterintuitive, point from Smith is that the division of labor, while productive, would make people "a bit feeble-minded and infurious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>. This is used to explain why current economic researchers, while smarter, are less broad and curious due to specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:32">[01:26:32]</a>.

## Broader Themes on Intellectual Influence

The podcast touches on several broader themes regarding the influence and evaluation of economists:

- **Evaluating Intellectuals:** There's a discussion on whether to judge intellectuals by their top contributions or their entire body of work, including failures. The speaker leans towards weighting top contributions heavily but acknowledges that failures often reflect aspects of their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. For the best thinkers like John Stuart Mill, a large quantity of diverse work was seen as necessary for their ability to see things from multiple perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
- **Evolution of Economic Thought:** Economics was once a primary way of carrying forward big ideas about the world. Today, this role is increasingly played by "Internet writing," which is multidisciplinary and distinct from academic theorizing [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>. This shift, along with increasing specialization and a focus on rigor over broad questions (as per William Stanley Jevons's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>), makes it unlikely for new "GOAT" (Greatest Of All Time) contenders to emerge in the traditional mold [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.

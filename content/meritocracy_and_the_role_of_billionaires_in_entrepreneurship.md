## Perspectives on Meritocracy and the Role of Billionaires in Entrepreneurship

This article summarizes Bryan Kaplan's views on meritocracy and the role of billionaires in fostering entrepreneurship, as discussed in a podcast episode.

### Meritocracy

Bryan Kaplan is a proponent of meritocracy, which he describes as a "good system" that is effective and possesses an intuitive appeal for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

#### Core Principles
Kaplan argues that the primary focus in selection processes, particularly in professional or results-oriented environments, should be on identifying and securing "top quality people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. He believes that simply aiming to increase the number of individuals from a particular demographic group (Group X) is the "wrong way to be approaching it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Instead, the emphasis should be on discovering methods that lead to knowledge and effective outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

#### Slippery Slope Concerns
Kaplan cautions against making exceptions to meritocratic principles, invoking the "slippery slope argument" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. He suggests that such deviations, once initiated, can lead to progressively worse outcomes and should not be dismissed lightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

#### Contextual Exceptions
While firmly defending meritocracy for roles that require achieving correct answers, effective operations, progress, or learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, Kaplan acknowledges that there can be specific business contexts where deviations might be justifiable. He uses the example of a bar having a "ladies night," which he would support if "that actually works and it's good business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. However, he distinguishes this from situations where the goal is objective performance or knowledge acquisition, where demographic representation should not be the focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### The Role of Billionaires in Entrepreneurship

Kaplan views the existence and success of billionaires as a significant factor in fostering a broader entrepreneurial culture.

#### Fostering an Entrepreneurial Culture
According to Kaplan, the drive to become a billionaire is not solely about personal enrichment; rather, it "fosters a whole culture of entrepreneurship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This culture, he observes, inspires many individuals who may never achieve billionaire status themselves but become "movers and shakers." He cites the entrepreneurial environment in Austin and individuals like Dwarkesh Patel as examples of this phenomenon, noting that even if Patel is unlikely to become a billionaire, he is still a dynamic contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

#### Tournament Theory and Incentives
Addressing arguments for higher taxation on billionaires (such as Scott Alexander's point, referenced in the podcast, that Amazon might have been built even with lower rewards for Jeff Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:46">[01:57:46]</a>), Kaplan introduces "[tournament theory](https://www.example.com)" [[economic_growth_and_ai]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:14">[01:58:14]</a>. This economic concept suggests that large, even seemingly "unreasonably large," rewards for top performers are socially valuable. They incentivize not only the successful individual (the "winner") but also "all the potential winners" who strive for such success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:15">[01:58:15]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:28">[01:58:28]</a>.
Billionaires, in this framework, inspire a "generation of movers and shakers." Kaplan believes that significantly taxing their earnings would "put a dent" in this inspirational effect and the entrepreneurial drive it cultivates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:23">[01:59:23]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:34">[01:59:34]</a>.

#### Direct Contributions and Uniqueness
Kaplan also highlights the direct contributions of billionaires, stating that a primary way they matter is that they "provide awesome stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. He questions the assumption that transformative businesses like Amazon would have inevitably been created to the same standard by others. He points to variations in entrepreneurship and management quality internationally and suggests it is "not crazy" to think that the next best alternative to Amazon might have been substantially inferior, perhaps "one-tenth as good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:10">[02:00:10]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:41">[02:00:41]</a>. A critical aspect of such entrepreneurial success, Kaplan notes, is the leader's ability to "assemble a team," a fundamental leadership skill [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:34">[02:01:34]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:46">[02:01:46]</a>.

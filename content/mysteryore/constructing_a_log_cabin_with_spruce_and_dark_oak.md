Constructing a log cabin in a snow biome brings a sense of nostalgia and coziness, reminiscent of classic survival game themes. In this episode of the [[building_a_starter_house_in_minecraft_hardcore | Minecraft Hardcore series]], we get an in-depth rundown of building a starter house using Spruce and Dark Oak materials. Below, we outline the journey of creating a charming wooden cabin from scratch.

## Choosing the Perfect Location

The first step in setting up the log cabin is selecting an ideal location. The host expresses a strong desire to construct the base in a snow biome due to its unique charm, despite the area's scarcity of resources [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">00:00:58</a>]. After surveying the area and ransacking a nearby village for supplies, the perfect hill for the cabin is found [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">00:01:30</a>].

## Gathering Essential Resources

### Dark Oak Wood
The primary construction materials for the cabin involve Dark Oak and Spruce. Unfortunately, [[resource_gathering_in_snow_biomes | the snow biome is devoid of these resources]], necessitating a journey to locate them. After a few comical attempts at choosing a suitable horse for travel, the host embarks on a quest to find Dark Oak trees [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">00:01:57</a>]. The Dark Oak is notably located quite a distance away, but it is critical to ensure all trees are completely cut down to avoid the unsightly floating tree phenomenon [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">00:02:23</a>].

### Spruce Wood
Spruce wood is another key component. The host finds enough logs after a bit of traveling and expertly navigates back home despite the initial trepidation about deforestation [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">00:03:09</a>]. However, misjudging the amount initially leads to a mid-construction materials shortage [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">00:03:42</a>].

## Constructing the Cabin

With the necessary materials gathered, the actual construction of the log cabin can commence [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">00:03:17</a>]. Initial efforts result in the establishment of fundamental architectural structures using a mixture of Dark Oak and Spruce logs. The placement aims to enhance the cozy aesthetic provided by the snow biome setting.

## Enhancing the Cabin Design

### Adding Character with a Fireplace and Chimney
Further design improvements include incorporating a stone chimney and a roaring fireplace. This requires additional stone resources mined from the spawn area [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">00:04:40</a>]. An innovative trick shared involves [[creating_a_chimney_with_a_smoke_effect_using_campfires_and_hay_bales | placing a campfire on top of hay bales to extend smoke height]], enhancing the visual realism of the chimney [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">00:06:21</a>].

### Final Touches: Windows and Doors
Completing the cabin involves installing windows crafted from light gray stained glass panes, bringing warmth and light into the interior [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">00:09:52</a>]. The use of oxide daisies and azure bluet flowers creatively ties in natural elements to [[gathering_materials_for_stained_glass_windows | craft the necessary dye for the glass]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">00:07:51</a>].

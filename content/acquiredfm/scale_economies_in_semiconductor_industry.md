[[Scale economies in semiconductor industry | Scale economies]] are present in the [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor industry]], though they exhibit unusual characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These economies of scale are a factor when companies like TSMC give up current profits in anticipation of future revenues, aiming for customer retention or acquiring new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The pursuit of more customers and revenue in the future is expected to yield differential returns, leading to inquiries about the existence and nature of [[Scale economies in semiconductor industry | scale economies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Unusual Industry Characteristics

The [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor industry]] possesses several unique characteristics that contribute to its distinctive [[Scale economies in semiconductor industry | scale economies]]:

*   **Large, Lumpy Capital Investments**
    Building a new fabrication plant (fab) requires substantial capital, estimated at $10 billion or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

*   **Predictable Material Performance Advances (Moore's Law)**
    Unlike many other fields, there is a relatively high assurance within the [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor industry]] that correct technology choices can lead to significant improvements, such as a 10x enhancement within 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This predictable rate of advancement, often associated with Moore's Law, is considered very unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

*   **Reliance on Upstream Suppliers for Technological Advantages**
    Technological advantages in the [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor industry]] are heavily driven by upstream suppliers, such as ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This dependence can present difficult choices for [[semiconductor_industry_dynamics | semiconductor companies]], as seen in historical debates regarding technologies like x-ray lithography, which involved considerable financial and intellectual investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

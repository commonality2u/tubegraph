[[Crossover investing]] is a significant trend in the venture capital landscape, characterized by firms that invest across both private and public markets. This dual approach allows them to support companies throughout their lifecycle, from early-stage venture funding to holding positions long after an Initial Public Offering (IPO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This strategy marks a departure from traditional distinctions between [[Venture capital and hedge funds | venture capital]] and hedge funds, which historically operated in separate spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

## Evolution and Key Players

Historically, investors like [[Charlie Mungers insights on investing and partnerships | Warren Buffett]] would invest in both public and private entities without distinguishing between them, simply seeking "great investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Early practitioners like Paul Reader of Par Capital, Seth Clarman at Baupost, and David Abrams also engaged in private investments, often in traditional businesses like auto dealerships or newspapers, before the term "crossover" was widely used in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

The modern [[The Evolution of Investment Strategies | evolution of this strategy]] gained prominence with firms like TCV (Technology Crossover Ventures), Tiger Global, and Coatue, who began incorporating private investments into their hedge fund portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. Altimeter Capital, founded by Brad Gerstner, is highlighted as one of the pioneers of this integrated approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Brad Gerstner's Journey to Crossover Investing

Brad Gerstner, having founded five companies himself, brings an entrepreneurial mentality to investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. His father's failed auto parts business, due to lack of access to capital and high interest rates, instilled in him a deep understanding of entrepreneurial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. He observed that in Silicon Valley, founder failure is often seen as a "badge of courage" due to the institutional structure of venture capital portfolios absorbing losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Rich Barton, co-founder of Expedia and Zillow, influenced Gerstner by suggesting he was better suited as an investor than an entrepreneur. Barton argued that entrepreneurs "will things into existence" and "suspend disbelief" about potential problems, while investors focus on the "distribution of probabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. This insight led Gerstner to believe he could build a better [[Venture capital investment strategies | venture capital business model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.

He apprenticed with Paul Reader at Par Capital, where he was given autonomy to invest in public tech companies like Google and Priceline, and make venture capital investments like leading the Series B in Zillow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. This experience reinforced his belief in a concentrated portfolio strategy and the importance of investing across public and private markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.

## The Birth of Altimeter Capital

Altimeter Capital officially launched on November 1, 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. This timing, amidst the 2008 financial crisis, was fraught with uncertainty, as many investors were unwinding private positions due to illiquidity concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. Despite initial skepticism, Gerstner persisted, believing in his vision and having a roadmap from his mentor, Paul Reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.

Gerstner moved Altimeter to Silicon Valley in 2012, aiming to build the "best crossover fund in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. He identified his differentiator as being a founder-led firm with a strong network in Silicon Valley, offering a more empathetic and aligned approach with founders compared to traditional hedge funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.

### Why Crossover Investing Emerged

Gerstner observed several market changes around 2004-2005 that created an opening for crossover funds:
*   **Deeper Private Markets:** Private markets were becoming more liquid and substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.
*   **Faster Scaling:** Companies were scaling faster due to the internet's network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
*   **Longer Private Duration:** Companies were staying private longer due to deeper private capital pools and more difficult IPO processes post-2000 and 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

This led to the "industrialization of venture," where the winners would look different from previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>.

## Altimeter's Strategy and Philosophy

Altimeter maintains both a public and a venture pool of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>. The public pool (long/short technology, with a focus on travel investments) can also do a certain amount of private investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. For venture and growth opportunities, they raised dedicated longer-duration capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

Key tenets of Altimeter's approach:
*   **Architectural Investing:** Identify overarching themes driven by human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>. Examples include the "decade of search" (Google, Zillow, Booking.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a> and the shift to mobile (beneficiaries were app icons rather than search) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. Another key theme was the remaking of the database market in the cloud, purpose-built for it, leading to investments like Snowflake and MongoDB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Non-Consensus Conviction:** Like [[Value Investing vs Growth Investing | Warren Buffett]], Gerstner believes the best investments are non-consensus but right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>. Their investment in Snowflake at a $175 million valuation exemplifies this, as it was considered a risky bet in 2013-2014 due to general pessimism about cloud computing and security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. Altimeter's team even "bug-bashed" Snowflake, providing detailed feedback to the founders, which helped win the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.
*   **Concentrated Portfolio:** Consistent with the history of venture capital, Altimeter seeks deals that can return the entire fund, avoiding over-diversification that might lead to "vintage returns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:45">[01:18:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.
*   **Founder-Centric Value-Add:** Altimeter aims to offer the "best of Tiger but also the best of Sequoia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>. While not competing in very early stages where firms like Benchmark and Sequoia excel at "craft building" with extensive support teams, Altimeter partners at later stages to provide capital scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. This includes helping with recruiting, board building, and capital raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. Their brand power also provides a "halo effect" for portfolio companies communicating with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:08">[01:32:08]</a>.
*   **Capital Markets Expertise:** Altimeter assists private companies with the transition to public markets, offering expertise in traditional IPOs, direct listings, and SPACs (like their own for Grab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>. Their team includes former heads of equity syndicate desks, providing unique insights without an economic finger in the scale for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

The [[The intersection of venture capital and media | venture market is maturing]], leading to increased competition and more efficient markets. This benefits founders with better access to capital and less dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. However, it also means a compression of returns, making it critical for firms to consistently identify and convert the best deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>.

Gerstner believes that the "industrialization of venture" is here to stay, similar to the consolidation seen in the LBO and private equity sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. He advocates for the return of earlier IPOs, which he believes would benefit public markets, retail investors, and provide companies with the discipline of public scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

### Democratizing Investment Access

A significant concern for Gerstner is the concentration of wealth created by the technology revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04">[01:37:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>. He champions the "Invest America" initiative, proposing that every child born in the U.S. receives an investment account, funded by the government based on means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:46">[01:39:46]</a>. This would address the perceived unfairness of accredited investor laws, which restrict access to early-stage investments mainly to the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:42">[01:38:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">[01:39:37]</a>. The goal is to psychologically include everyone in the system, fostering a sense of ownership and understanding of compounding returns, rather than just providing a financial safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:29">[01:40:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:46">[01:40:46]</a>. This vision suggests a future where [[Venture capital investment strategies | Altimeter's capital]] could be sourced more directly from individual retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:24">[01:50:24]</a>.

The overarching optimism for the future of capitalism and innovation remains high, with the belief that the next decade will see even greater ideas and opportunities emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:15">[01:47:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:26">[01:47:26]</a>.

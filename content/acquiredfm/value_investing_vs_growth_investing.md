This article explores the concepts of value and growth investing, featuring insights from legendary value investor Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, and his son, Andrew Marks, co-founder of TQ Ventures. Their co-authored memo, "Something of Value," became Howard's most popular memo ever, debating these contrasting, yet often intertwined, investment philosophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Defining the Investment Spectrum

Traditionally, value investing focuses on purchasing assets below their intrinsic value, often based on current cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>. Growth investing, conversely, prioritizes companies with high growth potential, often accepting lower current profits for higher future returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. However, a central theme of the Marks' discussion is that this dichotomy should not be "hardwired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

## Historical Perspectives and Evolution

Howard Marks' career began in equity research at Citibank in 1969, a time when the "Nifty Fifty" — a group of seemingly "best and fastest growing companies in America" — were considered so good that "there was no price too high" for their stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:50">[02:20:50]</a>. This era ended poorly, with many investors losing "almost all your money" in these companies, primarily because they were "priced too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:46">[02:28:46]</a>. This illustrates a key principle: even the best companies can be poor [[The significance of expectations investing and valuation | investments]] if overvalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

Howard later transitioned to the credit field, specializing in high-yield bonds, an area previously shunned by most investment organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. He found that the "excess yield" offered by these "low-rated debt" bonds was "more than sufficient to offset the credit losses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>. This experience taught him the value of "open-mindedness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a> and challenging rigid rules, such as Moody's manual defining a B-rated bond as failing "to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment" regardless of price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>. This reflects [[The Evolution of Investment Strategies | an evolution of investment strategy]] away from conventional wisdom.

Andrew Marks' own [[Investment philosophies and business strategies | investment philosophy]] evolved from initially being a value investor, influenced by his father and Warren Buffett's letters, to embracing growth companies, particularly in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. He learned to consider where companies reinvest cash flows at "really high rates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>, blurring the lines between traditional value and growth.

## Amazon: A Case Study in Growth and Value

Amazon serves as a prime example of the complexities that challenge traditional investment labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. A traditional value investor might have dismissed Amazon due to its initial lack of profitability on the income statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. However, Andrew points out that Amazon had a "very favorable cash conversion cycle," making it "much more sound from a free cash flow perspective" earlier on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.

This case also highlights the importance of betting on "amazing founder[s]" who can "leverage their business to create value in really compelling other ways," such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. This introduces the concept of "optional profitability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>, where current losses might be "the right thing in the interest of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>.

## Changing Market Dynamics and Competitive Advantage

The investment landscape has dramatically changed, with "technological adoption" speeding up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:12">[02:17:12]</a>. Businesses that were once considered impregnable, like newspapers, have faced [[The Role of Technology in Investing | disruption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Howard notes that in his youth, the world felt like a "consistent backdrop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:09">[02:08:09]</a>, but today "everything changes every minute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

This increased pace of change means that while companies are more "disruptible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, competitive advantages, if continuously mined and leveraged into "adjacent markets" or "new products," can lead to "much more value creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:06">[02:29:06]</a>. The internet, for example, allows companies to "address global markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>.

Andrew references Brian Arthur's "increasing returns in the new world of business," noting how "the best companies could continue to get bigger and bigger" due to new distribution models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This dynamic leads to "winners and losers maybe more dramatic than ever and happening faster than ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## The Role of Judgment and Skill in Investing

In today's markets, "information is totally ubiquitous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:22">[03:49:22]</a>, making it difficult to gain an advantage from "readily available quantitative information about the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Investing has become a "zero-sum game" where success depends on having a "knowledge advantage, a skill advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:01">[03:06:01]</a>.

This shifts the focus to making "qualitative judgments about the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Andrew believes that [[Venture capital investment strategies | venture investing]], with its focus on "finding huge gaps between what you're paying today and what this could be worth if it's right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, aligns with his skill set for long-term qualitative judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This requires imagining what a nascent business could look like in a decade, including its financials, moats, and potential for evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

Howard highlights the need for "second-level thinking" – thinking "at a higher level than others, differently but also better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>. This intangible skill, combining deep knowledge, rationality, and intellectual humility, cannot be reduced to an algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:12">[05:59:12]</a>. It's about being able to "see differently and better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.

## The Art of Selling

The decision of when to sell is as crucial as when to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>. Howard, from a more conservative background, initially favored "take some money off the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>, especially with investments like bonds where upside is capped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:23">[01:24:23]</a>. However, he now acknowledges that this approach can be a "huge mistake" for compounding assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>, citing the example of Amazon's massive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>.

Andrew argues that selling decisions should be based on "understanding what you own and why you are making the investment and what you're playing for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>, rather than merely "price action" or fear of regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>. For companies that truly compound value over decades, "selling them early is just a colossal mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>. He emphasizes that while "compounding certificates" are "extremely rare," they are "extremely extremely valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>.

## Building an Investment Firm

Both Howard and Andrew emphasize aligning their firm's structure and strategy with their personal strengths and enjoyment. Howard, having worked in a "management intensive bureaucracy" at Citibank, helped build Oaktree with a culture that was "largely an unguided missile in terms of management," focusing on shared values and complementary skills among partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:43">[04:48:43]</a>. They focused on their core competency, with Howard raising money and Bruce Karch and others managing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. Oaktree tends to increase its assets under management in "bad times" when investment opportunities are best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:42">[01:30:42]</a>.

Andrew's TQ Ventures operates differently, driven by a desire for "absolutely world-class returns" and a love for "investing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. They have "no ambition to broaden [their] firm in terms of strategies or turn [their] firm into some big asset manager," prioritizing maximizing time spent on investing over management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Their strategy hinges on building a "reputation with founders" and a broad network of talented individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>, reflecting a deep focus on [[Maintaining focus in venture capital amidst growth opportunities | core strengths]].

Ultimately, the discussion underscores the importance of choosing a path that "plays to your strengths and avoids your weaknesses," and that you "enjoy doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. This personal alignment, combined with open-mindedness and a willingness to evolve, is key to sustained success in the complex world of investing.
